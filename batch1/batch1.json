            "abstract": "Background: Macrophages play important roles in diabetes and sepsis-related intestinal injury. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as the fundamental link between macrophage polarization and tissue injury. However, the underlying mechanisms of miRNAs in regulating macrophage polarization-related intestinal injury under diabetes and sepsis conditions remain unclear. Methods: The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis models were established in male wild-type (WT) and diabetic mice. Clodronate liposome was used to deplete macrophage. H&E staining, inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6], and intestinal mucosal barrier function markers [occludin, ZO-1, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP)] were used to assess elevated intestinal damage. miRNA array, RNA-seq, and bioinformatic analysis were performed to detect the miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and the potential regulation mechanism. In vitro, RAW264.7 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of high glucose and LPS, miR-3061 mimics, and Snail small interfering RNA stimulation, respectively, for further mechanism studies. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interplay between miRNA and its target genes. Results: Compared with WT CLP mice, the diabetic CLP mice showed severe intestinal damage characterized by significant increases in Chui's scores, expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), serum LPS and iFABP concentration, and significant reductions in tight junction protein occludin and ZO-1 levels. Macrophage depletion reversed the intestinal damage caused by CLP. The bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-3061/Snail1 might be a potential regulation axis of macrophage polarization. Furthermore, high glucose and LPS stimulation increased M1 macrophage and reduced the levels of miR-3061, which was negatively associated with Snail1 in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that miR-3061 regulated macrophage polarization by targeting the Snail1 mRNA 3'-untranslated region. Moreover, miR-3061 overexpression suppressed Snail1 expression and inhibited M1 macrophage and inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: This study elucidated that diabetes exacerbated sepsis-induced intestinal injury by promoting M1 macrophage polarization and further demonstrated that the miR-3061/Sani1 axis may be the potential target of macrophage polarization."

                "title": "Naringin improves sepsis-induced intestinal injury by modulating macrophage polarization via PPAR\u03b3/miR-21 axis.",
                "abstract": "Naringin exhibited various pharmacological activities. However, its biological function and underlying mechanism in regulating macrophage polarization remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory network between naringin and macrophage polarization in sepsis-induced intestinal injury. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to establish the animal model of sepsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and a luciferase reporter assay were used to determine the interplay between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and miR-21 promoter, as well as miR-21 and its target genes. Naringin enhanced the overall survival of septic mice and alleviated the CLP-induced inflammatory response and intestinal damage. This was accompanied by the increased expression of PPAR\u03b3 in the intestines and the stimulation of ileal macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. Furthermore, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages, naringin stimulated M2 polarization. Mechanistically, PPAR\u03b3 inhibition attenuated the promotion of M2 polarization caused by naringin, and the naringin/PPAR\u03b3 regulatory work was compromised by miR-21 inhibition. The present study suggested that naringin promoted M2 polarization via the PPAR\u03b3/miR-21 axis, thus relieving sepsis-induced intestinal injury. This study provides novel insights into the mechanism by which naringin alleviated sepsis-induced intestinal injury through regulation of macrophage polarization."

                "abstract": "Excessive release of cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and other inflammatory mediators synthesized and secreted by macrophages is the fundamental link of uncontrolled inflammatory response in sepsis. 17\u03b2-Estradiol (E2) plays anti-inflammatory and vascular protective effects by regulating leukocyte infiltration and the expression of chemokines or cytokines induced by injury. However, the role of E2 in the inflammatory response of macrophages in sepsis and its mechanism are still not fully understood. In the present study, we show that E2 alleviates vascular inflammation in sepsis mice induced by cecal ligation puncture (CLP). E2 significantly decreases RAW 264.7 cell inflammation response by downregulating the expression of NLRP3. Furthermore, we found that miR-29a-5p was significantly downregulated in LPS-treated macrophages. Treating RAW 264.7 cells with E2 markedly upregulated the miR-29a-5p expression level. More importantly, we demonstrated that miR-29a-5p repressed NLRP3 expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that transfection of the miR-29a-5p mimic abrogates LPS-induced macrophage inflammation. Moreover, depletion of miR-29a-5p by its inhibitor largely promotes LPS-induced macrophage inflammation. In summary, miR-29a-5p upregulation induced by E2 alleviated RAW 264.7 cell inflammation response by aggravating miR-29a-5p repression of NLRP3 expression. E2 exerts significant anti-inflammatory efficacy in macrophages by regulating the miR-29a-5p/NLRP3 axis. Targeting miR-29a-5p may be a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress sepsis-induced vascular inflammation."

                "abstract": "Low miR-23a-3p expression in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or sepsis has been revealed. However, the specific role of miR-23a-3p in AKI remains unclear. Our study aimed to determine the function of miR-23a-3p in AKI. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce cell injury in vitro. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery was used to establish an animal model of septic AKI. Bioinformatics analysis and a wide range of experiments, including RT-qPCR, luciferase reporter, western blot, ELISA, TUNEL, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunofluorescence assays were conducted. The experimental results revealed that LPS exposure induced the significant apoptosis and inflammatory response of HK-2 cells, and miR-23a-3p exhibited a low expression in LPS-exposed HK-2 cells. Functionally, miR-23a-3p overexpression inhibited cell apoptosis and release of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8. Mechanistically, miR-23a-3p bound to the FKBP prolyl isomerase 5 (FKBP5) 3' untranslated region and negatively regulated its expression at mRNA and protein levels. Rescue assays indicated that FKBP5 overexpression reversed the influence of miR-23a-3p mimics on cell apoptosis and inflammatory response. Furthermore, miR-23a-3p overexpression attenuated the sepsis-induced impairment of renal function and the inflammatory response in mice with AKI. Finally, the knockdown of FKBP5 inactivated the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB) signaling by inactivating NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, and thereby inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Overall, our study demonstrates that miR-23a-3p ameliorates sepsis induced AKI by targeting FKBP5 and inactivating the NF-\u03baB signaling, implying a potential therapeutic or diagnostic target for AKI."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) infection-induced sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI) has emerged as a significant clinical challenge. Increasing evidence suggests that activated inflammatory macrophages contribute to tissue damage in sepsis. However, the underlying causes of widespread macrophage activation remain unclear. METHODS: BALB/c mice were intravenously injected with inactivated hvKp (iHvKp) to observe lung tissue damage, inflammation, and M1 macrophage polarization. In vitro, activated RAW264.7 macrophage-derived exosomes (iHvKp-exo) were isolated and their role in ALI formation was investigated. RT-PCR was conducted to identify changes in exosomal miRNA. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate MSK1 as a direct target of miR-155-5p. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to explore the specific mechanisms involved. RESULTS: iHvKp successfully induced ALI in vivo and upregulated the expression of miR-155-5p. In vivo, injection of iHvKp-exo induced inflammatory tissue damage and macrophage M1 polarization. In vitro, iHvKp-exo was found to promote macrophage inflammatory response and M1 polarization through the activation of the p38-MAPK pathway. RT-PCR revealed exposure time-dependent increased levels of miR-155-5p in iHvKp-exo. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed the functional role of miR-155-5p in mediating iHvKp-exo effects by targeting MSK1. Additionally, inhibition of miR-155-5p reduced M1 polarization of lung macrophages in vivo, resulting in decreased lung injury and inflammation induced by iHvKp-exo or iHvKp. CONCLUSIONS: The aforementioned results indicate that exosomal miR-155-5p drives widespread macrophage inflammation and M1 polarization in hvKp-induced ALI through the MSK1/p38-MAPK Axis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contributed to the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), while TLR4 is reported to mediate the LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages. However, the potential molecular mechanisms for TLR4-mediated macrophages activation in T2D have not yet to be fully clarified. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes models in C57BL/6J mice were generated by a combination administration of streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-fat diet (HFD). Cell proportions of M1 and M2 macrophages were analyzed using flow cytometry. Expression profiles of miR-448 and TLR 4 were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. KEY FINDINGS: LPS/IFN-\u03b3 significantly induced M1 polarization in macrophages characterized by the increased levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, iNOS and decreased levels of TNF-\u03b2, CCL-22, IL-10 and Arg-1, with a higher expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in vitro. Consistently, T2D mice-derived macrophages had a significantly elevated expression of TLR4 mRNA and decreased expression of miR-448. We further confirmed that miR-448 could inhibit TLR4 expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of TLR4, rescuing the LPS/IFN-\u03b3-induced M1 macrophage polarization. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicated that decreased miR-448 in diabetic macrophages may contribute to LPS-induced M1 polarization by targeting TLR4, thereby modulating T2D development."

                "abstract": "Adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA 1 (ADAR1) mediates adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing events. ADAR1 is highly expressed in \"septic\" macrophages and in small intestinal tissues of mice with sepsis. Overexpression of ADAR1 suppresses inflammation and intestinal damage. However, the specific underlying mechanism is unclear. This study was conducted to explore how microRNA (miRNA) regulates the anti-inflammatory mechanism of macrophages following ADAR1 upregulation. A murine sepsis model was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were randomly assigned to sham, CLP, and CLP+ADAR1 groups. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and fluorescence isothiocyanate-dextran were used to evaluate intestinal injury and permeability. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and Luminex assays were performed to detect changes in the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Adenoviruses were used to express ADAR1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation analysis was conducted to detect the binding of ADAR1 and miRNAs. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the binding of miRNAs and regulatory factors. We observed that ADAR1 significantly increased the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in macrophages and reduced the expression of interleukin-6 in macrophages and the serum, thereby reducing intestinal permeability and mucosal injury in mice with sepsis. The RNA-ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation binding assay and qRT-PCR demonstrated a direct interaction between ADAR1 and pri-miR-30a. The luciferase assay demonstrated that SOCS3 was significantly inhibited by miR-30a-5p, the mature product of miR-30a. Thus, ADAR1 exerts a protective effect against sepsis by reducing inflammation and organ damage via the ADAR1-miR-30a-SOCS3 axis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a troublesome syndrome that can cause intestinal injury and even high mortality rates. Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are known to protect against intestinal damage. Accordingly, the current study set out to explore if omega-3 FAs could affect sepsis-induced intestinal injury with the involvement of the microRNA (miR)-1-3p/Notch3-Smad axis. METHODS: First, cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) was performed to establish septic mouse models in C57BL/6J mice, and mouse intestinal epithelial MODE-K cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish sepsis cell models. The CLP-induced septic mice or LPS-exposed cells were subjected to treatment with Omega-3 FAs and activin (Smad signaling activator), miR-1-3p inhibitor and over-expressed/short hairpin RNA (oe-/sh)-Notch3 to explore their roles in inflammation, intestinal oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was further performed to verify the regulatory relationship between miR-1-3p and Notch3. RESULTS: Omega-3 FAs inhibited CLP-induced intestinal injury and ameliorated LPS-induced intestinal epithelial cell injury by down-regulating miR-1-3p, as evidenced by decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6, in addition to diminished levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, miR-1-3p could down-regulate Notch3, which inactivated the Smad pathway. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings indicated that omega-3 FAs elevate the expression of Notch3 by down-regulating miR-1-3p, and then blocking the Smad pathway to alleviate intestinal epithelial inflammation and oxidative stress injury caused by sepsis."

                "abstract": "This study aims to confirm the protective effect of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on intestinal mucosal barrier damage in sepsis in animal and cell models and explore its mechanism. Analysis of the GSE147775 gene set revealed that the level of PTX3 was upregulated in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat sepsis model. The mice sepsis model was established by cecal ligation perforation (CLP), and the cell inflammation model was induced by LPS. Cell apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related protein were detected by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The PTX3 level was significantly upregulated in the mice sepsis model. Intestinal mucosal barrier damage was aggravated and inflammatory factor expression was upregulated after PTX3 downregulation in sepsis mice. After upregulation of PTX3, intestinal mucosal barrier damage was alleviated and inflammatory factor expression was decreased in sepsis mice. Further data mining suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of PTX3 might be realized through inhibition of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Moreover, compared with the LPS group, downregulation of PTX3 increased cell apoptosis and the levels of BCL2-associated X (Bax), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and decreased the levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), zona occludens (ZO)-1, and occludin. On the contrary, overexpression of PTX3 reduced cell apoptosis and the levels of Bax, MPO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, downregulation of PTX3 reversed the inhibitive effects on cell apoptosis and inflammation and promotive effects on the levels of Zo-1 and occludin induced by CLI-095 (a TLR signaling pathway inhibitor). In the CLP-induced mice sepsis model and LPS-induced cell inflammation model, PTX3 inhibits inflammatory response and reduces intestinal mucosal barrier damage through the TLR signaling pathway."

However, the role of Dioscin in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its related mechanisms is unclear and needs further study. METHODS: The colitis model in mice was established. After Dioscin (20, 40, or 80\u00a0mg/kg) treatment, the colon length was measured by a ruler. Histopathology, inflammatory cytokines, gut permeability, tight junction proteins, macrophage infiltration, macrophage polarization, and miR-125a-5p level were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), FITC-dextran, Western blot, and flow cytometry. In vitro experiments, after RAW264.7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interleukin-4 (IL-4), were treated with Dioscin and miR-125a-5p inhibitor, miR-125a-5p level, cell vitality, inflammatory cytokines, and M1/M2 marker genes were measured by qRT-PCR and MTT assay. RESULTS: Dioscin (20, 40, or 80\u00a0mg/kg) relieved DSS-triggered colitis and restrained the serum and colon of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. Meanwhile, different concentrations' Dioscin weakened M1 macrophage polarization but facilitated tight junction protein expressions, M2 macrophage polarization, and miR-125a-5p level in colitic mice. Moreover, miR-125a-5p inhibitor reversed the modulation of Dioscin on miR-125a-5p expression, cell vitality, and inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. We further discovered that Dioscin restrained M1 marker gene (CD16) expression while intensifying M2 marker genes (CD206 and Arginase-1) expressions in vitro, which was reversed by miR-125a-5p inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Dioscin modulated macrophage polarization by increasing miR-125a-5p, thereby improving the intestinal epithelial barrier function and reducing IBD."

                "abstract": "Lung injury is one of the leading causes of death in sepsis. Abietic acid (AA) has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and bacteriostatic properties. Herein, we established a mouse model of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture, and intraperitoneally injected AA to treat. Lung injury was assessed by H&E staining and the inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were assessed by counting the number of inflammatory cells and detecting the content of inflammatory factors. Meanwhile, we also designed to study the effect of AA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response and macrophage marker gene expression in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. In this study, we found that AA inhibited LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MIP-2), and decreased the expression of M1 macrophage e markers (CD16 and iNOS) and p-p65 protein, while increased the expression of M2 macrophage markers (CD206 and Arg-1) in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. In vivo, the therapy of AA not only rescued septic animals, but also attenuated lung injury in sepsis mice. Moreover, AA decreased the number of total cells, neutrophils and macrophages, the conceration of total protein, and the levels of inflammatory mediators in BALF of sepsis mice. Further, we found that AA inhibited M1 macrophage polarization and blocked nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) pathway in BALF of sepsis mice.

However, the role of PMN-derived exosomes in sepsis-related ALI and the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. METHODS: Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), a key regulator of innate immunity in sepsis-related ALI, was used to stimulate PMNs from healthy C57BL/6J mice in vitro. Exosomes isolated from the supernatant were injected to C57BL/6J wild-type mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) and then examined for lung inflammation, macrophage (M\u03d5) polarization and pyroptosis. In vitro co-culture\u00a0system was applied where the mouse Raw264.7 macrophages or bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were co-cultured with PMN-derived exosomes to further confirm the results of in vivo animal study and explore the potential mechanisms involved. RESULTS: Exosomes released by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated PMNs (TNF-Exo) promoted M1 macrophage activation after in vivo i.p. injection or in vitro co-culture. In addition, TNF-Exo primed macrophage for pyroptosis by upregulating NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome expression through nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that miR-30d-5p mediated the function of TNF-Exo by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in macrophages.

The intestine plays a key role in the occurrence and development of sepsis. Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (San ye qing, SYQ), a precious Chinese medicine, has been widely used for centuries due to its high traditional value, such as a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect. However, the role of SYQ in intestinal permeability during the development of sepsis needs to be discovered. METHODS: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate intestinal mucosal barrier function damage in sepsis. Pathological section, inflammatory cytokines, tight junctions, cell apoptosis, and intestinal flora were detected to evaluate the protective effect of SYQ on intestinal mucosal barrier injury in LPS-induced septic mice. RESULTS: The results showed that SYQ treatment obviously attenuated LPS-induced intestinal injury and reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Besides, SYQ also up-regulated the expressions of tight junctions, including Zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), Claudin-5, and Occludin along with a decreased in the levels of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin light chain (MLC). In addition, SYQ down-regulated the expression of Bax/Bcl2 as well as that of cleaved caspase-3 to prevent the cells from undergoing apoptosis. Further, SYQ restored the diversity of the intestinal flora, increased the abundance of Firmicutes, and decreased the abundance of Bacteroidota. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that SYQ exerted its protective effect on intestinal mucosal barrier injury in LPS-induced septic mice by reducing inflammatory response, improving the tight junction protein expression, inhibiting cell apoptosis, and adjusting the intestinal flora structure."

MiR-382-5p has displayed low expression in developing lungs with BPD, while the effect of miR-382-5p on BPD remains elusive. Here, a hyperoxia (85% oxygen)-induced BPD model in neonatal mice was established. On postnatal days 10 and 15, hyperoxia reduced miR-382-5p expression in lungs of mice.

Rescue assays revealed that CDK8 reversed the mitigating roles of miR-382-5p in inflammatory response and M1 macrophage polarization, as reflected by increased IL-6 and CD40 levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-382-5p may suppress M1 macrophage activation and inflammatory response via inhibiting CDK8, thereby regulating the development of BPD, which is possibly mediated by STAT1 signaling."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Acute lung injury (ALI) increases sepsis morbidity and mortality. LncRNA H19 plays a critical role in sepsis. miR-107 is highly-expressed and TGF\u03b2 type III receptor (TGFBR3) is poorly-expressed in sepsis, yet their roles in sepsis development require further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of H19 in alleviating sepsis-induced ALI through the miR-107/TGFBR3 axis. METHODS: Mice were intravenously injected with Ad-H19 adenovirus vector or control vector one week before establishing the mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were transfected with oe-H19 or oe-NC plasmids and then stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Lung injury was assessed via hematoxylin-eosin staining, measurement of wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio, and TUNEL staining. Levels of H19, miR-107, and TGFBR3 were determined by RT-qPCR. Apoptosis of PMVECs was evaluated by flow cytometry. Levels of Bax and Bcl-2 in lung tissues and PMVECs were measured using Western blot. Total protein concentration and the number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were quantified. Levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 in BALF, lung tissues, and PMVECs were measured by ELISA. Cross-linking relationships among H19, miR-107 and TGFBR3 were verified by dual-luciferase and RIP assays. RESULTS: H19 was poorly-expressed in CLP-operated mice. H19 overexpression attenuated sepsis-induced ALI, which was manifested with complete alveolar structure, decreased lung injury score and lung W/D ratio, and inhibited apoptosis in CLP-operated mice, which was manifested with decreased number of TUNEL-positive cells and Bax level and increased Bcl-2 level. CLP-operated mice had increased concentration of total protein and number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in BALF, which was nullified by H19 overexpression. H19 overexpression declined levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 and elevated IL-10 levels. H19 inhibited LPS-induced PMVEC apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. H19 targeted TGFBR3 as the ceRNA of miR-107. miR-107 overexpression or silencing TGFBR3 partially averted the inhibition of H19 overexpression on LPS-induced PMVEC apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. CONCLUSION: LncRNA H19 inhibited LPS-induced PMVEC apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and attenuated sepsis-induced ALI by targeting TGFBR3 as the ceRNA of miR-107."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is identified as a severe inflammatory disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to be a powerful anti-inflammatory chemical substance in numerous diseases. However, the underlying mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of EGCG in sepsis remains to be elucidated. METHODS: The surgery for cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed on male C57BL/6J mice aged 8\u00a0weeks. THP-1 cells were treated with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24\u00a0h to imitate sepsis in vitro. Haematoxylene-Eosin (HE) staining of the sections of liver, lung and kidney was performed to evaluate the pathological changes. The inflammatory cytokines were quantitated by ELISA. qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression levels of PVT1, miR-16-5p, and TLR4. The protein level of TLR4 was also assessed by Western blotting. Double luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to validate the interactions among PVT1, miR-16-5p, and TLR4. RESULTS: EGCG inhibited the expression levels of PVT1 and TLR4 and enhanced miR-16-5p expression in CLP-operated mice and LPS-treated THP-1 cells. EGCG reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, which were restored by PVT1 overexpression. Mechanistically, PVT1 bound with miR-16-5p to activate TLR4 signaling. Further experiments demonstrated that miR-16-5p silencing or TLR4 overexpression antagonized sh-PVT1 or miR-16-5p mimics-mediated inhibitory effects on inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Knockdown of PVT1 alleviated inflammatory injury in CLP-induced sepsis in mice. CONCLUSION: EGCG may effectively lower the levels of sepsis-induced inflammatory cytokines by targeting the PVT1/miR-16-5p/TLR4 axis."

                "abstract": "The mortality rate for patients experiencing sepsis is decreasing; however, an effective therapeutic strategy requires further investigation. Increasing evidence has supported the idea that dysregulated microRNAs (miR) participate in the development of sepsis. Meanwhile, macrophages are crucial players in various inflammatory responses and diseases. The objective of the current study was to investigate the associated molecular mechanisms of action of miR-15a-5p on inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophages and the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS for 4 h, and ELISAs were subsequently used to measure the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, in RAW264.7 macrophages. The expression levels of miR-15a-5p in RAW264.7 macrophages were detected after the stimulation of LPS using reverse transcription quantitative-PCR. The results indicated that the IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and miR-15a-5p levels were significantly increased compared with the control group. The Target gene prediction database (TargetScan) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were subsequently employed, and TNF-\u03b1 induced protein 3-interacting protein 2 (TNIP2) was confirmed as a direct target for miR-15a-5p. Additionally, it was found that the TNIP2 expression levels were decreased in RAW264.7 macrophages following LPS treatment compared with controls. The present study also examined the effects of miR-15a-5p inhibitor on inflammatory cytokine expression levels and the activation of the NF-\u03ba signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that miR-15a-5p inhibitor reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited NF-\u03ba pathway activation by targeting TNIP2. This may be associated with the progression of sepsis. Meanwhile, a LPS-induced mouse model of sepsis was established to examine the regulation of TNIP2 and miR-15a-5p during inflammation. In the animal model, miR-15a-5p inhibitor significantly suppressed the secretion of inflammatory factors. The levels of creatin, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in the serum of LPS-treated mice were also found to be decreased in the miR-15a-5p inhibitor treatment group, while the protective effects of miR-15a-5p inhibitor on sepsis were eliminated by TNIP2-small interfering RNA combination therapy. In conclusion, the present findings indicated that miR-15a-5p may be involved in the inflammatory process during sepsis by activating the NF-\u03ba pathway and targeting TNIP2. This suggests that miR-15a-5p inhibitor may be a novel anti-inflammatory agent and therapeutic strategy for sepsis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Translocator protein (TSPO) is an 18-kDa transmembrane protein found primarily in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and it is implicated in inflammatory responses, such as cytokine release. Koumine (KM) is an indole alkaloid extracted from Gelsemium elegans Benth. It has been reported to be a high-affinity ligand of TSPO and to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in our recent studies. However, the protective effect of KM on sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) and its mechanisms are unknown. PURPOSE: To explore the role of TSPO in SALI and then further explore the protective effect and mechanism of KM on SALI. METHODS: The effect of KM on the survival rate of septic mice was confirmed in mouse models of caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. The protective effect of KM on CLP-induced SALI was comprehensively evaluated by observing the morphology of the mouse liver and measuring liver injury markers. The serum cytokine content was detected in mice by flow cytometry. Macrophage polarization in the liver was examined using western blotting. TSPO knockout mice were used to explore the role of TSPO in sepsis liver injury and verify the protective effect of KM on sepsis liver injury through TSPO. RESULTS: KM significantly improved the survival rate of both LPS- and CLP-induced sepsis in mice. KM has a significant liver protective effect on CLP-induced sepsis in mice. KM treatment ameliorated liver ischaemia, improved liver pathological injuries, and decreased the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and proinflammatory cytokines in serum. Western blotting results showed that KM inhibited M1 polarization of macrophages and promoted M2 polarization. In TSPO knockout mice, we found that TSPO knockout can improve the survival rate of septic mice, ameliorate liver ischaemia, improve liver pathological injuries, and decrease the levels of ALT, AST, and LDH. In addition, TSPO knockout inhibits the M1 polarization of macrophages in the liver of septic mice and promotes M2 polarization and the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, in TSPO knockout septic mice, these protective effects of KM were no longer effective. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that TSPO plays a critical role in sepsis-associated liver injury by regulating the polarization of liver macrophages and reducing the inflammatory response. KM, a TSPO ligand, is a potentially desirable candidate for the treatment of SALI that may regulate macrophage M1/M2 polarization through TSPO in the liver."

However, the regulatory effect and mechanism of miR-34b-3p on AKI remains elusive. First, sepsis mice with AKI was established via cecal ligation puncture (CLP), and verified through hematoxylin-eosin staining, determination of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6/1\u03b2 and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Data showed that CLP-induced mice demonstrated increased ALT, BUN, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 with injured pathological morphology of kidney tissues. Second, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment elevated TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 contents in rat mesangial cells (RMCs). MiR-34b-3p was downregulated in both CLP-induced mice and LPS-induced RMCs. Third, target gene of miR-34b-3p was verified as ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A), and UBL4A was upregulated in LPS-induced RMCs. MiR-34b-3p could inhibit UBL4A expression and decreased TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 contents in LPS-induced RMCs, while overexpression of UBL4A counteract with the suppressive effects of miR-34b-3p on the protein expression. Moreover, transcriptional activity of UBL4A-induced NF-\u03baB was decreased by miR-34b-3p. Lastly, in vivo injection of miR-34b-3p agomir improved CLP-induced kidney tissues injury with declined ALT, BUN, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and UBL4A. In general, miR-34b-3p overexpression could alleviate AKI in sepsis mice through downregulation of UBL4A/NF-\u03baB, providing potential therapeutic strategy for AKI."

Naringin has been reported to exhibit a variety of biological effects. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of naringin on sepsis-induced injury of intestinal barrier function in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups named sham (n\u202f=\u202f20), CLP\u202f+\u202fvehicle (n\u202f=\u202f20), CLP\u202f+\u202fNG (30\u202fmg/kg) (n\u202f=\u202f20) and CLP\u202f+\u202fNG (60\u202fmg/kg) (n\u202f=\u202f20) groups. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). H&E staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to observe intestinal mucosal morphology. ELISA was used to determine the intestinal permeability and inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro. Western blot and RhoA activity assay were performed to determine the levels of tight junction proteins and the activation of indicated signaling pathways. MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. RESULTS: Naringin improved survival rate of CLP mice and alleviated sepsis-induced intestinal mucosal injury. Furthermore, naringin improved impaired intestinal permeability and inhibited the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, while increased IL-10 level in CLP mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MODE-K cells in a dose-dependent manner. Naringin increased the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 via RhoA/ROCK/NF-\u03baB/MLCK/MLC signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.

                "abstract": "The balance between M1 and M2 macrophage polarization is involved in the regulation of pulmonary inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2, also known as Nrf2), a nuclear transcription factor, is reported to play protective roles in acute lung injury (ALI) and inflammation, and increasing evidence indicates that the protective effects of Nrf2 are closely related to autophagy. This study aimed to explore whether Nrf2 is involved in sepsis-induced acute pulmonary injury and inflammation and in the role of macrophage polarization in the process. In the present study, sepsis patients, an Nrf2 knockout mouse that underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophage cell lines were employed to investigate the potential functions of Nrf2 in sepsis-induced lung injury and the underlying mechanisms. Clinical studies showed that the NRF2 mRNA level was inversely correlated with pulmonary inflammation and disease severity in patients with sepsis. Analyses in a CLP-treated Nrf2 knockout mouse model indicated that an Nrf2 deficiency promoted a CLP-induced increase in M1 macrophage polarization and apoptosis and inhibited CLP-induced upregulation of the autophagy level in lung tissues. Experiments in RAW264.7 cells revealed that Nrf2 overexpression inhibited M1 macrophage polarization but promoted M2 macrophage polarization by improving the autophagy, and Nrf2 overexpression promoted PPAR\u03b3 but inhibited NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. In conclusion, these results indicate that Nrf2 plays a protective role in sepsis-induced pulmonary injury and inflammation through the regulation of autophagy- and NF-\u03baB/PPAR\u03b3-mediated macrophage polarization."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dysregulated activation of the inflammasome is involved in various human diseases including acute cerebral ischemia, multiple sclerosis and sepsis. Though many inflammasome inhibitors targeting NOD-like\u00a0receptor\u00a0protein\u00a03 (NLRP3) have been designed and developed, none of the inhibitors are clinically available. Growing evidence suggests that targeting apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), the oligomerization of which is the key event for the assembly of inflammasome, may be another promising therapeutic strategy. Lonidamine (LND), a small-molecule inhibitor of glycolysis used as an antineoplastic drug, has been evidenced to have anti-inflammation effects. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism is still largely unknown. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and LPS-induced sepsis mice models were constructed to investigate the therapeutic and anti-inflammasome effects of LND. The inhibition of inflammasome activation and ASC oligomerization by LND was evaluated using western blot (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Direct binding of LND with ASC was assessed using molecular mock docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS). RESULTS: Here, we find that LND strongly attenuates the inflammatory injury in experimental models of inflammasome-associated diseases including autoimmune disease-multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic stroke and sepsis. Moreover, LND blocks diverse types of inflammasome activation independent of its known targets including hexokinase 2 (HK2). We further reveal that LND directly binds to the inflammasome ligand ASC and inhibits its oligomerization. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results identify LND as a broad-spectrum inflammasome inhibitor by directly targeting ASC, providing a novel candidate drug for the treatment of inflammasome-driven diseases in clinic."

Spirodalesol, derived from the ascomycete fungus Daldinia eschscholzii, has been reported to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Based on the structure of spirodalesol, we synthesized and screened a series of analogs to find a more potent inhibitor. Analog compound 8A was identified as the most potent selective inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, but 8A did not inhibit the priming phase of the inflammasome. Specifically, while 8A did not reduce NLRP3 oligomerization, we found that it inhibited the oligomerization of adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC), as ASC speck formation was significantly reduced. Also, 8A interrupted the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and inhibited the activation of caspase-1. Subsequently, we used a cellular thermal shift assay and microscale thermophoresis assay to demonstrate that 8A interacts directly with ASC, both in\u00a0vitro and ex\u00a0vivo. Further, 8A alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia, as well as monosodium urate-induced peritonitis and gouty arthritis in mice by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, 8A was identified as a promising ASC inhibitor to treat inflammasome-driven diseases."

                "abstract": "Sepsis is a dysregulated systemic inflammatory response caused by infection that leads to multiple organ injury and high mortality without effective treatment. Corilagin, a natural polyphenol extracted from traditional Chinese herbs, exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties. However, the role for Corilagin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process have not been completely explored. Here we determine the effect of Corilagin on LPS-treated mice and use a screening approach integrating surface plasmon resonance with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPR-LC-MS/MS) to further explore the therapeutic target of Corilagin. We discovered that Corilagin significantly prolonged the survival time of septic mice, attenuated the multi-organ injury and the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins in tissues of LPS-treated mice. In vitro studies revealed that Corilagin inhibited pyroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-treated macrophages followed with ATP stimulation, as reflected by decreased levels of GSDMD-NT and activated caspase-1, and reduced ASC specks formation. Mechanistically, Corilagin alleviated the formation of ASC specks and blocked the interaction of ASC and pro-caspase1 by competitively binding with the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of ASC. Additionally, Corilagin interrupted the TLR4-MyD88 interaction through targeting TIR domain of MyD88, leading to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and NLRP3 production. In addition, Corilagin downregulated genes associated with several inflammatory responses and inflammasome-related signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Overall, our results indicate that the inhibitory effect of Corilagin on pyroptosis through targeting TIR domain of MyD88 and binding the CARD domain of ASC in macrophages plays an essential role in protection against LPS-induced sepsis."

Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome is beneficial to these diseases, but few NLRP3 inflammasome-selective inhibitors are identified to date. Essential oils (EOs) are liquid mixtures of volatile and low molecular-weight organic compounds extracted from aromatic plants, which show various pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we screened active ingredients from essential oils, and identified 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene (1,2,4-TTB) as a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. We showed that 1,2,4-TTB (1\u2009mM) markedly suppressed nigericin- or ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus decreased caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) and in primary mouse microglia. Moreover, 1,2,4-TTB specifically inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome without affecting absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation. We further demonstrated that 1,2,4-TTB inhibited oligomerization of the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and protein-protein interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, thus blocking NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in iBMDMs and in primary mouse macrophages. In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), administration of 1,2,4-TTB (200\u2009mg\u2009\u00b7\u2009kg-1\u2009\u00b7\u2009d-1, i.g. for 17 days) significantly ameliorated EAE progression and demyelination. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 1,2,4-TTB is an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor and attenuates the clinical symptom and inflammation of EAE, suggesting that 1,2,4-TTB is a potential candidate compound for treating NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases, such as multiple sclerosis."

Our studies established that JC-171 dose dependently inhibited LPS/ATP-induced interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) release from J774A.1 macrophages with an IC50 of 8.45 \u00b1 1.56 \u03bcM. Selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced IL-1\u03b2 release by this compound was also confirmed using mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages and LPS-challenged mice in vivo. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation study revealed that JC-171 interfered with NLRP3/ASC interaction induced by LPS/ATP stimulation. More importantly, JC-171 treatment delayed the progression and reduced the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS, in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. This coincided with blocking of IL-1\u03b2 production and a pathogenic Th17 response.

Instead, it disrupts the interaction between NLRP3 and adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), then blocks the formation of ASC speck. Thus, our study identified a specific inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome and suggested SI-2 as a potential inhibitory agent for the therapy of NLRP3-driven diseases."

                "abstract": "Gouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals, which induce the activation of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3(NLRP3) inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome, composed of NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC, and caspase-1, is closely linked to the pathogenesis of various metabolic diseases including gouty arthritis. We investigated whether an orally administrable inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome was effective for alleviating the pathological symptoms of gouty arthritis and what was the underlying mechanism. In primary mouse macrophages, caffeic acid phenethyl ester(CAPE) blocked caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production induced by MSU crystals, showing that CAPE suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In mouse gouty arthritis models, oral administration of CAPE suppressed MSU crystals-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production in the air pouch exudates and the foot tissues, correlating with attenuation of inflammatory symptoms. CAPE directly associated with ASC as shown by SPR analysis and co-precipitation, resulting in blockade of NLRP3-ASC interaction induced by MSU crystals. Our findings provide a novel regulatory mechanism by which small molecules harness the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by presenting ASC as a new target. Furthermore, the results suggest the preventive or therapeutic strategy for NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases such as gouty arthritis using orally available small molecules."

                "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system. NLRP3 activation is induced by diverse stimuli associated with bacterial infection or tissue damage, but its inappropriate activation is involved in the pathogenesis of inherited and acquired inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which NLRP3 is activated remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored the role of kinases in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by screening a kinase inhibitor library and identified 3,4-methylenedioxy-\u03b2-nitrostyrene (MNS) as an inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, MNS did not affect the activation of the NLRC4 or AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome. Mechanistically, MNS specifically prevented NLRP3-mediated ASC speck formation and oligomerization without blocking potassium efflux induced by NLRP3 agonists. Surprisingly, Syk kinase, the reported target of MNS, did not mediate the inhibitory activity of MNS on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We also found that the nitrovinyl group of MNS is essential for the inhibitory activity of MNS. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and mutation studies suggest that both the nucleotide binding oligomerization domain and the leucine-rich repeat domain of NLRP3 were the intracellular targets of MNS. Administration of MNS also inhibited NLRP3 ATPase activity in vitro, suggesting that MNS blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome by directly targeting NLRP3 or NLRP3-associated complexes. These studies identified a novel chemical probe for studying the molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation which may advance the development of novel strategies to treat diseases associated with abnormal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.

The inflammasomes promote inflammation by maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Several inflammasomes have been identified so far, but this review focuses mainly on the NLRP3 inflammasome. By still ill-defined activation mechanisms, a sensor molecule, NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3), responds to danger signals and rapidly recruits ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1 to form a large oligomeric signaling platform-the inflammasome. Involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infections, metabolic disorders, autoinflammation, and autoimmunity, underscores its position as a central player in sensing microbial and damage signals and coordinating pro-inflammatory immune responses. Indeed, evidence in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests inflammasome activation occurs during disease. Experiments with the mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), specifically describe the NLRP3 inflammasome as critical and necessary to disease development. This review discusses recent studies in EAE and MS which describe associations of inflammasome activation with promotion of T cell pathogenicity, infiltration of cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and direct neurodegeneration during EAE and MS."

Furthermore, VitD3 specifically prevented NLRP3-mediated apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization. In additional to this, NLRP3 binding to NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) was also inhibited. Notably, VitD3 inhibited autophagy, leading to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Uncoupling protein 2-reactive oxygen species signaling may be involved in inflammasome suppression by VitD3. Importantly, VitD3 had both preventive and therapeutic effects on mouse model of ulcerative colitis, via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our results reveal a mechanism through which VitD3 represses inflammation and prevents the relevant diseases, and suggest a potential clinical use of VitD3 in autoimmune syndromes or other NLRP3 inflammasome-driven inflammatory diseases."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation has been found to be associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and dementia. Attenuation of microglia-induced inflammation is a strategy that impedes the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate murine microglia cells (BV2 cells) as an experimental model to mimic the inflammatory environment in the brain. In addition, we examined the anti-inflammatory ability of corylin, a main compound isolated from Psoralea corylifolia L. that is commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine. The production of nitric oxide (NO) by LPS-activated BV2 cells was measured using Griess reaction. The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by LPS-activated BV2 cells was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activation and recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in LPS-activated BV2 cells was examined by Western blot. RESULTS: Our experimental results demonstrated that corylin suppressed the production of NO and proinflammatory cytokines by LPS-activated BV2 cells. In addition, corylin inhibited the expression of iNOS and COX-2, attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38, decreased the expression of NLRP3 and ASC, and repressed the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 by LPS-activated BV2 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the anti-inflammatory effects of corylin acted through attenuating LPS-induced inflammation and inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-activated BV2 cells. These results suggest that corylin might have potential in treating brain inflammation and attenuating the progression of neurodegeneration diseases."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Artemisia anomala S. Moore (Compositae), known as \"Nan-Liu-Ji-Nu\" in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been used to treat many inflammatory diseases, including enteritis, acute icteric hepatitis, rheumatism, toothache, tonsillitis, and chronic bronchitis, for centuries. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that the ethanolic extract of A. anomala (EAA) might be with the potential of inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the anti-inflammatory activity of EAA based on NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition is still unclear. PURPOSE: This work aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of EAA by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The level of IL-1\u03b2 was determined by ELISA. The expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, caspase-1, NLRP3, and ASC were assayed using western blot analysis. ASC oligomerization and speck formation were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. The measurements of intracellular chloride and potassium were conducted using N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide (MQAE) probe assay and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), respectively. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were examined using the MitoSOX method. Acridine orange (AO) staining was used to detect the permeability of the lysosomal membrane. A DSS-induced ulcerative colitis model was established to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of EAA in vivo. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to identify and quantify the major constituents of EAA. RESULTS: In BMDMs, EAA significantly inhibited the release of IL-1\u03b2 induced by LPS. The mechanistic study revealed that EAA inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by blocking the oligomerization of ASC and suppressed the LPS-induced priming step. Furthermore, EAA protected lysosomes by inhibiting the TAK1-JNK pathway, thereby inhibiting the assembly of downstream NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1\u03b2. In addition, EAA exerted potent protective effects in an ulcerative colitis model by decreasing the content of colonic IL-1\u03b2 and alleviating the process of ulcerative colitis. HPLC analysis identified eight main components of EAA, including isofraxidin (1), quercetin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (2), apigenin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (3), 7-methoxycoumarin (4), quercetin (5), luteolin (6), kaempferol (7), and eupatorin (8), Of these compounds, quercetin and kaempferol were found to be the most potent ingredients. CONCLUSION: These findings collectively reveal that EAA exerts anti-inflammatory effects by both suppressing the NLRP3 priming step and protecting lysosomes to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that this traditional herbal medicine might be used to treat NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases."

Mutations in the gene encoding NLRP3 cause rare cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and growing evidence links NLRP3 inflammasome to common diseases such as Alzheimer\u00b4s disease. In order to modulate different stages of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly nine peptides whose sequences correspond to segments of inflammasome components NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) were selected. Five peptides inhibited IL-1\u03b2 release, caspase-1 activation and ASC oligomerization in response to soluble and particulate NLRP3 triggers. Modulatory peptides also attenuated IL-1\u03b2 maturation induced by constitutive CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants. Peptide corresponding to H2-H3 segment of ASC pyrin domain selectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to NLRP3 pyrin domain in the micromolar range. The peptide had no effect on AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes as well as NF-\u03baB pathway. The peptide effectively dampened neutrophil infiltration in the silica-induced peritonitis and when equipped with Antennapedia or Angiopep-2 motifs crossed the blood-brain barrier in a mouse model. Our study demonstrates that peptides represent an important tool for targeting multiprotein inflammatory complexes and can serve as the basis for the development of novel anti-inflammatory strategies for neurodegeneration."

                "abstract": "Macroautophagy/autophagy plays an important role in regulating cellular homeostasis and influences the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases. Tendinopathy is characterized by tendon degeneration and inflammation. However, little is known about the role of selective autophagy in tendinopathy. Here, we find that pristimerin (PM), a quinone methide triterpenoid, is more effective in treating tendinopathy than the first-line drug indomethacin. PM inhibits the AIM2 inflammasome and alleviates inflammation during tendinopathy by promoting the autophagic degradation of AIM2 through a PYCARD/ASC-dependent manner. A mechanistic study shows that PM enhances the K63-linked ubiquitin chains of PYCARD/ASC at K158/161, which serves as a recognition signal for SQSTM1/p62-mediated autophagic degradation of the AIM2-PYCARD/ASC complex. We further identify that PM binds the Cys53 site of deubiquitinase USP50 through the Michael-acceptor and blocks the binding of USP50 to PYCARD/ASC, thereby reducing USP50-mediated cleavage of K63-linked ubiquitin chains of PYCARD/ASC. Finally, PM treatment in vivo generates an effect comparable to inflammasome deficiency in alleviating tendinopathy. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PM alleviates the progression of tendinopathy by modulating AIM2-PYCARD/ASC stability via SQSTM1/p62-mediated selective autophagic degradation, thus providing a promising autophagy-based therapeutic for tendinopathy.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; AIM2: absent in melanoma 2; AT: Achilles tenotomy; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BMDMs: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CHX: cycloheximide; Col3a1: collagen, type III, alpha 1; CQ: chloroquine; Cys: cysteine; DARTS: drug affinity responsive target stability; DTT: dithiothreitol; DUB: deubiquitinase; gDNA: genomic DNA; GSH: glutathione; His: histidine; IL1B/IL-1\u03b2: interleukin 1 beta; IND: indomethacin; IP: immunoprecipitation; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; NLRP3: NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; PM: pristimerin; PYCARD/ASC: PYD and CARD domain containing; SN: supernatants; SOX9: SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; Tgfb: transforming growth factor, beta; TIMP3: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3; TNMD: tenomodulin; TRAF6: TNF receptor-associated factor 6; Ub: ubiquitin; USP50: ubiquitin specific peptidase 50; WCL: whole cell lysates."

AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the anti-inflammasome activity and the underlying mechanisms of action of the compounds from L. japonicus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of compounds were isolated from L. japonicus.

NLRP3 inflammasome formation and apoptosis speck like containing a CARD (ASC) oligomerization were evaluated by immunofluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis. The regulation of autophagy after treatment of this compound was also evaluated. Lastly, in vivo activity of Leojaponin was analyzed in a mouse acute gouty arthritis model. RESULTS: Here we show that Leojaponin, a diterpenoid compound from L. japonicus, suppressed lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1\u03b2 release in Nigericin-stimulated macrophages in a pyroptosis model. Leojaponin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both J774A.1\u00a0cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages in a dose dependent manner.

Inflammasomes are also known to be involved in the development of some human and animal autoimmune diseases. The Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is currently the most fully characterized inflammasome, although a limited number of studies have demonstrated its role in demyelinating autoimmune diseases in the central nervous system of humans and animals. Currently, the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), is known to be induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome through enhanced recruitment of inflammatory immune cells in the central nervous system. On the other hand, interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2), a first-line drug to treat MS, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and ameliorates EAE. The NLRP3 inflammasome is indeed a factor capable of inducing EAE, but it is dispensable when EAE is induced by aggressive disease induction regimens. In such NLRP3 inflammasome-independent EAE, IFN-\u03b2 treatment is generally not effective. This might therefore be one mechanism that leads to occasional failures of IFN-\u03b2 treatment in EAE, and possibly, in MS as well. In the current review, we discuss inflammasomes and autoimmunity; in particular, the impact of the NLRP3 inflammasome on MS/EAE, and on IFN-\u03b2 therapy."

SINO also attenuated astrocytic and microglial activation in the ischemic hemisphere. NLRP3 inflammasome activation after MCAO and OGD induction, with the up-regulation of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), cleaved caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, was significantly inhibited by SINO treatment both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, SINO reversed the OGD-induced inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation in vitro. Further, the suppressive effect of SINO on NLRP3 inflammasomes was blocked by an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C.

Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is a highly attractive way for identifying new drugs. Here, proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a marketed drug for treating multiple myeloma, was found to specifically inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation at nanomolar concentrations.

Bortezomib reduced ASC oligomerization and ASC speck formation. In addition, bortezomib inhibited the activity of the core subunit \u03b25i in the immunoproteasome and reduced \u03b25i binding to NLRP3.

In addition to detect the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, the activation of NF-\u03baB, ASC-speck formation and ASC oligomerization were examined by western blotting and immunofluorescent stainning. Eventually, the extractions of BBD were applied for UPLC-QTOF-MS analyses; refer to the identified chemicals, the bioactive compounds in BBD with anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activities were discussed. RESULTS: BBD improved the survival of sepsis mice accomplished with diminished inflammatory cytokines production and multiple organ injury. Mechanistically, BBD inhibited both the NF-\u03baB pathway and the assembly of NLRP3 complex in PMs. There were 29 chemical compounds identified from sample 1 and 20 from sample 2. Both samples contained bile acids and saponins and sample 2 contained 2 extra chemicals in the category of bile acids. CONCLUSIONS: BBD presents therapeutic role of endotoxin induced sepsis by inhibiting NLRP3-medaited inflammasome activation, which supports its traditional use for the treatment of infectious diseases. The bile acids and saponins are most likely related to the anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activation effect of BBD."

The lack of vaccine and antivirals has brought an urgent need for an animal model. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we generated a mouse model expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) by using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin technology. In comparison with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, both young and aged hACE2 mice sustained high viral loads in lung, trachea, and brain upon intranasal infection. Although fatalities were not observed, interstitial pneumonia and elevated cytokines were seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected-aged hACE2 mice. Interestingly, intragastric inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 was seen to cause productive infection and lead to pulmonary pathological changes in hACE2 mice. Overall, this animal model described here provides a useful tool for studying SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis and evaluating COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics."

We previously identified the causative agent as a novel SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the entry receptor. Here, we successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 transgenic mouse (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice) infection model. The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients. Viral quantification revealed the lungs as the major site of infection, although viral RNA could also be found in the eye, heart, and brain in some mice. Virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome sequences was isolated from the infected lung and brain tissues. Last, we showed that pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could protect mice from severe pneumonia. Our results show that the hACE2 mouse would be a valuable tool for testing potential vaccines and therapeutics."

                "abstract": "Newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has caused extensive mortality and morbidity and wreaked havoc on socioeconomic structures. The urgent need to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and enable continued development of effective countermeasures is aided by the production of laboratory tools that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research. We previously created a directly accessible SARS-CoV-2 toolkit containing user-friendly reverse genetic (RG) infectious clones of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using K18-human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, we confirmed the validity of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses to reproduce the infection profile, clinical disease, and pathogenesis already established in mice infected with natural SARS-CoV-2 isolates, often patient derived. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice developed substantial clinical disease and weight loss by day 6 postinfection. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from the lungs and brains of infected K18-hACE2 mice, and infection resulted in viral pneumonia with considerable changes in lung pathology, as seen previously with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In mice infected with RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-mCherry, mCherry was detected in areas of lung consolidation and colocalized with clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2-assocated immunopathology. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses successfully recapitulated many of the features of severe COVID-19 associated with the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With utility in vivo, the RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be valuable resources to advance numerous areas of SARS-CoV-2 basic research and COVID-19 vaccine development.IMPORTANCE To develop COVID-19 countermeasures, powerful research tools are essential. We produced a SARS-COV-2 reverse genetic (RG) infectious clone toolkit that will benefit a variety of investigations. In this study, we further prove the toolkit's value by demonstrating the in vivo utility of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates reproduce disease signs and pathology characteristic of the K18-hACE2 mouse model of severe COVID-19 in infected mice. Having been validated as a model of severe COVID-19 previously using only natural SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients, this is the first investigation of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses in K18-hACE2 mice. The RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will facilitate basic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the preclinical development of COVID-19 therapeutics."

It is critical that vaccines and therapeutics be developed very rapidly. Mice, the ideal animal for assessing such interventions, are resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we overcome this difficulty by exogenous delivery of human ACE2 with a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5-hACE2). Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice developed pneumonia characterized by weight loss, severe pulmonary pathology, and high-titer virus replication in lungs. Type I interferon, T\u00a0cells, and, most importantly, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) are critical for virus clearance and disease resolution in these mice. Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice enabled rapid assessments of a vaccine candidate, of human convalescent plasma, and of two antiviral therapies (poly I:C and remdesivir).

                "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) [1-3]. Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in the nasal turbinates, lung and brain, with high lethality, and cytokine/chemokine production. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the nasal turbinates and lung, and no clinical signs of infection. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing vaccines and antivirals, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains."

Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of therapeutic and vaccine development; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the virus's inability to use the mouse orthologue of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and exhibit pathological findings found in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we show that type I interferons do not control SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo but are significant drivers of pathological responses. Thus, the AAV-hACE2 mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds."

                "abstract": "The development of mouse models for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has enabled testing of vaccines and therapeutics and defining aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 disease is severe in K18 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2 Tg) expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, under an ectopic cytokeratin promoter, with high levels of infection measured in the lung and brain. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 knock-in (KI) mice that express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2 (mACE2). Intranasal inoculation of hACE2 KI mice with SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 resulted in substantial viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts with limited spread to extrapulmonary organs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 KI mice did not lose weight and developed limited pathology. Moreover, no significant differences in viral burden were observed in hACE2 KI mice infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 variants compared to the WA1/2020 strain. Because the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in mice remain uncertain, we evaluated the impact of the naturally occurring, mouse-adapting N501Y mutation by comparing infection of hACE2 KI, K18-hACE2 Tg, ACE2-deficient, and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The N501Y mutation minimally affected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 KI mice but was required for viral replication in wild-type C57BL/6 mice in a mACE2-dependent manner and augmented pathogenesis in the K18-hACE2 Tg mice. Thus, the N501Y mutation likely enhances interactions with mACE2 or hACE2 in vivo. Overall, our study highlights the hACE2 KI mice as a model of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease and clarifies the requirement of the N501Y mutation in mice. IMPORTANCE Mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis have facilitated the rapid evaluation of countermeasures. While the first generation of models developed pneumonia and severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, they relied on ectopic expression of supraphysiological levels of human ACE2 (hACE2). This has raised issues with their relevance to humans, as the hACE2 receptor shows a more restricted expression pattern in the respiratory tract. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease with viruses containing or lacking a key mouse-adapting mutation in the spike gene in hACE2 KI mice, which express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2. While infection of hACE2 KI mice with multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern resulted in viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the animals did not sustain severe lung injury. Thus, hACE2 KI mice serve as a model of mild infection with both ancestral and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains."

One limitation to the evaluation of potential therapies and vaccines to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and ameliorate disease is the lack of susceptible small animals in large numbers.

Here, we transduced replication-defective adenoviruses encoding human ACE2 via intranasal administration into BALB/c mice and established receptor expression in lung tissues. hACE2-transduced mice were productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this resulted in high viral titers in the lung, lung pathology, and weight loss. Passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced viral burden in the lung and mitigated inflammation and weight loss. The development of an accessible mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis will expedite the testing and deployment of therapeutics and vaccines."

Here, we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promoter (K18). In contrast to nontransgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to 2 different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease, including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection, and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals showed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the low-dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice, with 60% surviving infection, whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared with female mice.

Here, we characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in the epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2 infections typically start. We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lung, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009101 and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered from infection with a low dose of virus survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans being dose-dependent and can provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached nearly 240 million cases, caused nearly 5 million deaths worldwide as of October 2021, and has raised an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To achieve this goal, an animal model that recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenesis and survival in response to different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that this model could be a useful tool for the development of antiviral drugs and therapeutics."

An animal model is a valuable and a crucial tool that allows understanding of nature in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated COVID-19 disease. Here we introduce detailed protocols of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease using C57BL/6 (B6) transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) from the human cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18 hACE2). To mimic natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, K18 hACE2 transgenic mice are infected intranasally under anesthesia. Upon infection, viral pathogenesis is determined by monitoring changes in body weight (morbidity) and monitoring survival (mortality), cytokine/chemokine responses, gross-lung pathology, histopathology, and viral replication in tissues. The presence of the virus and viral replication is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and viral titrations, respectively, from the upper (nasal turbinate) and the lower (lungs) respiratory tracts, and nervous system (brain). Also, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is measured by cytokine/chemokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from lung, spleen and brain homogenates to characterize the cytokine storm that hallmarks as one of the major causes of death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This small rodent animal model based on the use of K18 hACE2 transgenic mice represents an excellent option to understand the pathogenicity of natural SARS-CoV-2 strains and its recently described Variants of Concern (VoC), and will be applicable to the identification and characterization of prophylactic (vaccine) and therapeutic (antiviral and/or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies) strategies for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection or its associated COVID-19 disease."

                "abstract": "Several models were developed to study the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as the in vivo efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics. Since wild-type mice are naturally resistant to infection by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains, several transgenic mouse models expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) were developed. An alternative approach has been to develop mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here, we compared the clinical progression, viral replication kinetics and dissemination, pulmonary tropism, and host innate immune response dynamics between the mouse-adapted MA10 strain and its parental strain (USA-WA1/2020) following intranasal inoculation of K18-hACE2 mice, a widely used model. Compared to its parental counterpart, the MA10 strain induced earlier clinical decline with significantly higher viral replication and earlier neurodissemination. Importantly, the MA10 strain also showed a wider tropism, with infection of bronchiolar epithelia. While both SARS-CoV-2 strains induced comparable pulmonary cytokine/chemokine responses, many proinflammatory and monocyte-recruitment chemokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IP-10/CXCL10, and MCP-1/CCL2, showed an earlier peak in MA10-infected mice. Furthermore, both strains induced a similar downregulation of murine Ace2, with only a transient downregulation of Tmprss2 and no alterations in hACE2 expression. Overall, these data demonstrate that in K18-hACE2 mice, the MA10 strain has a pulmonary tropism that more closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 tropism in humans (airways and pneumocytes) than its parental strain. Its rapid replication and neurodissemination and early host pulmonary responses can have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes of infection and are, therefore, critical features to consider for study designs using these strains and mouse model. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is still significantly impacting health care systems around the globe. Refined animal models are needed to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity as well as efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics. In line with this, thorough evaluation of animal models and virus strains/variants are paramount for standardization and meaningful comparisons. Here, we demonstrated differences in replication dynamics between the Wuhan-like USA-WA1/2020 strain and the derivative mouse-adapted MA10 strain in K18-hACE2 mice. The MA10 strain showed accelerated viral replication and neurodissemination, differential pulmonary tropism, and earlier pulmonary innate immune responses. The observed differences allow us to better refine experimental designs when considering the use of the MA10 strain in the widely utilized K18-hACE2 murine model."

Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs). They also support the use of this system to study SARS-CoV-2 persistence and host recovery."

We observed weight loss as well as virus replication in the lungs of hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of considerable numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes into the alveolar interstitium, and the accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities. We observed viral antigens in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia. These phenomena were not found in wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV-2.

                "abstract": "The rapid emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global health emergency. While most human disease is mild to moderate, some infections lead to a severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, anosmia, ageusia, and, in some instances, neurological involvement. Small-animal models reproducing severe disease, including neurological sequela, are needed to characterize the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of disease and to identify medical countermeasures. Transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the K18 promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge when high viral doses are used. Here, we report on SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters engineered to express the hACE2 receptor under the control of the K18 promoter. K18-hACE2 hamsters infected with a relatively low dose of 100 or 1,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 developed a severe and lethal disease, with most animals succumbing by day 5 postinfection. Hamsters developed severe lesions and inflammation within the upper and lower respiratory system, including infection of the nasal cavities causing marked destruction of the olfactory epithelium as well as severe bronchopneumonia that extended deep into the alveoli. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection spread to the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain stem and spinal cord. Wild-type (WT) hamsters naturally support SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the primary lesions present in the respiratory tract and nasal cavity. Overall, infection in the K18-hACE2 hamsters is more extensive than that in WT hamsters, with more CNS involvement and a lethal outcome. These findings demonstrate the K18-hACE2 hamster model will be valuable for studying SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has created a global health emergency. While most human SARS-CoV-2 disease is mild, some people develop severe, life-threatening disease. Small-animal models mimicking the severe aspects of human disease are needed to more clearly understand the pathophysiological processes driving this progression. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters engineered to express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 viral receptor under the control of the K18 promoter. SARS-CoV-2 produces a severe and lethal infection in transgenic hamsters that mirrors the most severe aspects of COVID-19 in humans, including respiratory and neurological injury. In contrast to other animal systems, hamsters manifest disease with levels of input virus more consistent with natural human infection. This system will be useful for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease and the development of drugs targeting this virus."

Our quest to test new therapeutics and vaccines require small animal models that replicate disease phenotypes seen in COVID-19 cases. Rodent models of SARS-CoV-2 infection thus far have shown mild to moderate pulmonary disease; mortality, if any, has been associated with prominent signs of central nervous system (CNS) infection and dysfunction. Here we describe the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 variants with propensity for either pulmonary or CNS infection. Using a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a COVID-19 patient, we first found that infection was lethal in transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Fortuitously, full genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the brain and lung of these animals showed genetic differences. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 isolates from brains and lungs of these also showed differences in plaque morphology. Inoculation of these brain and lung SARS-CoV-2 isolates into new batch of hACE2 mice intra-nasally resulted in lethal CNS and pulmonary infection, respectively. Collectively, our study suggests that genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 could be used to replicate specific features of COVID-19 for the testing of potential vaccines or therapeutics."

                "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused a pandemic with millions of human infections. There continues to be a pressing need to develop potential therapies and vaccines to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection to mitigate the ongoing pandemic. Epidemiological data from the current pandemic indicates that there may be sex-dependent differences in disease outcomes. To investigate these differences, we proposed to use common small animal species that are frequently used to model disease with viruses. However, common laboratory strains of mice are not readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of differences in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for the virus. To overcome this limitation, we transduced common laboratory accessible strains of mice of different sexes and age groups with a novel a triple AAV6 mutant, termed AAV6.2FF, encoding either human ACE2 or luciferase via intranasal administration to promote expression in the lung and nasal turbinates. Infection of AAV-hACE2-transduced mice with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in high viral titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates, establishment of an IgM and IgG antibody response, and modulation of lung and nasal turbinate cytokine profiles. There were insignificant differences in infection characteristics between age groups and sex-related differences; however, there were significant strain-related differences between BALB/c vs. C57BL/6 mice. We show that AAV-hACE2-transduced mice are a useful for determining immune responses and for potential evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral therapies, and this study serves as a model for the utility of this approach to rapidly develop small-animal models for emerging viruses."

While SARS-CoV infection has not recurred to a significant extent since 2003, it still remains a potential threat. Understanding of SARS and development of therapeutic approaches have been hampered by the absence of an animal model that mimics the human disease and is reproducible. Here we show that transgenic mice that express the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) in airway and other epithelia develop a rapidly lethal infection after intranasal inoculation with a human strain of the virus. Infection begins in airway epithelia, with subsequent alveolar involvement and extrapulmonary virus spread to the brain. Infection results in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both the lung and the brain. This model of lethal infection with SARS-CoV should be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for the development of antiviral therapies."

            "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), with neurotoxic and neuroinvasive properties, is the major cause of human viral encephalitis in Asia. Although Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome caused by JEV infections is not frequent, a few cases have been reported in recent years. To date, no existing animal model for JEV-induced peripheral nerve injury (PNI) has been established, and thus the pathogenic mechanism is not clarified. Therefore, an animal model is urgently required to clarify the correlation between JEV infection and PNI. In the present study, we used JEV GIb strain of NX1889 to establish a mouse model of JEV infection. The general neurological signs emerged on day 3 of modeling. The motor function continued to deteriorate, reaching a maximum at 8 to 13\u2009days postinfection (dpi) and gradually recovered after 16\u2009dpi. The injuries of 105 PFU and 106 PFU groups were the most severe. Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining showed varying degrees of demyelination and axonal degeneration in the sciatic nerves. The electrophysiological recordings demonstrated the presence of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with reduced nerve conduction velocity. The decreased amplitudes and the prolonged end latency revealed axonal-type motor neuropathy. Demyelination is predominant in the early stage, followed by axonal injury. The expression level of JEV-E protein and viral RNA was elevated in the injured sciatic nerves, suggesting that it may cause PNI at the early stage. Inflammatory cell infiltration and increased inflammatory cytokines indicated that neuroinflammation is involved in JEV-induced PNI. IMPORTANCE JEV is a neurotropic flavivirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family and causes high mortality and disability rates. It invades the central nervous system and induces acute inflammatory injury and neuronal death. Thus, JEV infection is a major global public health concern. Previously, motor dysfunction was mainly attributed to central nervous system damage. Our knowledge regarding JEV-induced PNI is vague and neglected. Therefore, a laboratory animal model is essential. Herein, we showed that C57BL/6 mice can be used to study JEV-induced PNI through multiple approaches. We also demonstrated that viral loads might be positively correlated with lesion severity. Therefore, inflammation and direct virus infection may be the putative mechanisms underlying JEV-induced PNI. The results of this study laid the foundation for further elucidation of the pathogenesis mechanisms of PNI caused by JEV."

                "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is just an acute encephalitis syndrome contributed to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. It the chief causes of viral encephalitis in Asia. In recent years, association of JEV infection with neurological problems such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome(GBS) had reported. Nevertheless, its potential pathogenic mechanism has not previously been reported. Therefore, it is urgent to study the relationship between peripheral nerve injury (PNI) and JEV infection. Here, we use the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique to make out the protein expression levels of mice sciatic nerve between JEV infection group and the sham group. In general, 4303 proteins were designated by MS, and 187 differentially expressed proteins(DEPs) were found. There were 105 proteins up-regulated in the injured sciatic nerve, and 82 proteins were down-regulated. Functional enrichment analysis of DEPs showed that the up-regulated proteins were mainly related to immune regulatory response, and down-regulated proteins were related to ribosomal structural components and translation. SIGNIFICANCE: The Japanese encephalitis virus, a member of the flavivirus, is a Mosquito borne virus. It leads to central nervous system injury by the immune response and inflammation in the brain. In addition, the virus also gave rise to PNI. It is a major public health problem in Asia. The diversity of clinical symptoms has brought serious challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Label-Free Proteomics was undertaken to explore the potential mechanisms between JEV and peripheral nervous system in this study. It provided strong evidence that tissue damage is caused by the immune-mediated mechanisms rather than the virus, which offers a basis for the prevention of the disease and further looking for treatment targets."

Infection with this virus also induces peripheral nerve injury. However, the disease pathogenesis is still not completely understood. Reliable animal models are needed to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of this condition. We studied the effect of Japanese encephalitis virus infection in C57BL/6 mice after a subcutaneous challenge. Limb paralysis was determined in mice using behavioral tests, including a viral paralysis scale and the hanging wire test, as well as by changes in body weight. Nerve conduction velocity and electromyography testing indicated the presence of demyelinating neuropathy of the sciatic nerve. Pathological changes in neural tissues were examined by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, which confirmed that the predominant pathologic change was demyelination. Although Western blots confirmed the presence of the virus in neural tissue, additional studies demonstrated that an immune-induced inflammatory response resulted in severe never injury. Immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus in the brains of infected mice, and an inflammatory reaction was observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining as well. However, these observations were inconsistent at the time of paralysis onset. In summary, our results demonstrated that Japanese encephalitis virus infection could cause inflammatory demyelination of the peripheral nervous system in C57BL/6 mice."

                "title": "Viral Infection of the Central Nervous System and Neuroinflammation Precede Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption during Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection.",
                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Japanese encephalitis is an acute zoonotic, mosquito-borne disease caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Japanese encephalitis is characterized by extensive inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, the pathogenic mechanisms contributing to the BBB disruption are not known. Here, using a mouse model of intravenous JEV infection, we show that virus titers increased exponentially in the brain from 2 to 5 days postinfection. This was accompanied by an early, dramatic increase in the level of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the brain. Enhancement of BBB permeability, however, was not observed until day 4, suggesting that viral entry and the onset of inflammation in the CNS occurred prior to BBB damage. In vitro studies revealed that direct infection with JEV could not induce changes in the permeability of brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers. However, brain extracts derived from symptomatic JEV-infected mice, but not from mock-infected mice, induced significant permeability of the endothelial monolayer. Consistent with a role for inflammatory mediators in BBB disruption, the administration of gamma interferon-neutralizing antibody ameliorated the enhancement of BBB permeability in JEV-infected mice. Taken together, our data suggest that JEV enters the CNS, propagates in neurons, and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which result in the disruption of the BBB. IMPORTANCE: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, resulting in 70,000 cases each year, in which approximately 20 to 30% of cases are fatal, and a high proportion of patients survive with serious neurological and psychiatric sequelae. Pathologically, JEV infection causes an acute encephalopathy accompanied by BBB dysfunction; however, the mechanism is not clear. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of BBB disruption in JEV infection is important. Our data demonstrate that JEV gains entry into the CNS prior to BBB disruption. Furthermore, it is not JEV infection per se, but the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines induced by JEV infection that inhibit the expression of TJ proteins and ultimately result in the enhancement of BBB permeability. Neutralization of gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) ameliorated the enhancement of BBB permeability in JEV-infected mice, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 could be a potential therapeutic target. This study would lead to identification of potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of JEV infection."

                "title": "Minocycline differentially modulates macrophage mediated peripheral immune response following Japanese encephalitis virus infection.",
                "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that is the causative agent of a major mosquito-borne encephalitis in the world. Evasion of peripheral immune system facilitates the entry of the virus into the central nervous system (CNS) where it causes extensive neuronal inflammatory damage that leads to death or severe neuropschychiatric sequel in survivors. It has been proposed that after entry into the body, the virus is carried into the CNS by peripheral immune cells that act as Trojan horses. In this study we investigate whether macrophages can be considered as such a Trojan horse. We also investigate the role of minocycline, a synthetic tetracycline, in such processes. Minocycline has been found to be broadly protective in neurological disease models featuring inflammation and cell death but there has been no report of it having any modulatory role in peripheral macrophage-mediated immune response against viral infection. Persistence of internalized virus within macrophages was visualized by immunofluorescent staining. Cytotoxicity assay revealed that there was no significant cell death after 24 h and 72 h infection with JEV. Proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in cells that were infected with JEV but it was abrogated following minocycline treatment. Reactive oxygen species level was also increased after JEV infection. Nitric oxide level was found to increase after 72 h post infection but remained unchanged after 24h. The cellular levels of signaling molecules such as PI3 kinase, phophoAkt and phospho p38MAP kinase were found to be altered after JEV infection and minocycline treatment. JEV infection also affected the VEGF-MMP pathway. Increased activity of MMP-9 was detected from JEV-infected macrophage culture supernatants after 72 h; minocycline treatment resulted in reduced activity. Thus it seems that minocycline dampens peripheral immune reactions by decreasing proinflammatory cytokine release from infected macrophages and the virus survives within macrophages long enough to be carried into the CNS, even though minocycline inhibits cell survival."

                "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus that causes Japanese encephalitis (JE), which has an unclear pathogenesis. Despite vaccination, thousands of deaths attributed to JE are reported annually. In this study, we report that mice deficient for Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays multiple roles in flaviviral infection, displayed greater mortality upon JEV infection. The effect of Axl deficiency on JEV infection was mediated by markedly elevated serum interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) levels, which devastated the blood-brain-barrier and promoted viral neuroinvasion within 24 h postinfection. Using an in situ infection model, we showed that dead macrophages were the primary source of observed increased serum IL-1\u03b1 levels. Axl deficiency enhanced cell death and caused pyroptosis in 80% of JEV-infected macrophages by disrupting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling. Intriguingly, the primary effector released by pyroptotic macrophages in our model was IL-1\u03b1 rather than IL-1\u03b2. Finally, we assessed the effect of an IL-1\u03b1 antagonist and demonstrated that it effectively prevented the incidence of JE. Our results indicate that Axl plays a protective role in JEV infection, identify IL-1\u03b1 released by pyroptotic macrophages as a crucial factor promoting JEV neuroinvasion, and suggest that an IL-1\u03b1 antagonist may be a candidate for JE therapy.IMPORTANCE Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes Japanese encephalitis (JE), the most commonly diagnosed viral encephalitis worldwide. The fatality rate of JE is 20%, and nearly half of the surviving patients develop neuropsychiatric sequelae. Axl is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays multiple roles in flaviviral infections. Currently, the involvement of Axl in JEV infection remains enigmatic. In this study, we demonstrate that Axl impedes the pathogenesis of severe JE in mice by maintaining blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity and restricting viral neuroinvasion. Furthermore, serum IL-1\u03b1 is a key mediator of this process and is primarily released by JEV-infected pyroptotic macrophages to elicit BBB breakdown, while an IL-1\u03b1 antagonist can effectively reduce the incidence of severe JE. Our work uncovers the protective role of Axl in antagonizing severe JE and shows that the use of an IL-1\u03b1 antagonist may be a promising tactic to prevent severe JE."

                "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a pathogen that causes severe vector-borne zoonotic diseases, thereby posing a serious threat to human health. Although JEV is potentially neurotropic, its pathogenesis and distribution in the host have not been fully elucidated. In this study, an infected mouse model was established using a highly virulent P3 strain of JEV. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, combined with anatomical imaging of the mouse brain, were used to dynamically localize the virus and construct three-dimensional (3D) images. Consequently, onset of mild clinical signs occurred in some mice at 3.5 d post JEV infection, while most mice displayed typical neurological signs at 6 d post-infection (dpi). Moreover, brain pathology revealed typical changes associated with non-suppurative encephalitis, which lasted up to 8 d. The earliest detection of viral antigen was achieved at 3 dpi in the thalamus and medulla oblongata. At 6 dpi, the positive viral antigen signals were mainly distributed in the cerebral cortex, olfactory area, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem regions in mice. At 8 dpi, the antigen signals gradually decreased, and the localization of JEV tended to concentrate in the cerebrum and thalamus, while no viral antigen was detected in the brain at 21 dpi. In this model, the viral antigen was first expressed in the reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt), and the virus content is relatively stable. The expression of the viral antigen in the hippocampal CA2 region, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and the deep mesencephalic nucleus was high and persistent. The 3D images showed that viral signals were mostly concentrated in the parietal cortex, occipital lobe, and hippocampus, near the mid-sagittal plane. In the early stages of infection in mice, a large number of viral antigens were detected in denatured and necrotic neurons, suggesting that JEV directly causes neuronal damage. From the time of its entry, JEV is widely distributed in the central nervous system thereby causing extensive damage."

Four groups of 15 mice each (4-5 weeks old BALB/c mice of either sex) was used for the study. Mice were intravenously infected with lethal dose of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0pfu of JEV, followed by mortality after 8 days. On the next day and onwards, the animals were administered intraperitonially with (-)-tetrahydropalmatine (LTHP) solution (0.1\u00a0mg/mL in PBS) for the next 7 days. Animals exhibited protection against JEV infection, after being administered with LTHP. Reduction in levels of, viral population, caspase-2 expression, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, microglial cells and proinflammatory mediators, stress linked protein molecules and neuronal apoptosis was exhibited in JEV infected animals treated with LTHP. The effects produced by the administration of LTHP indicated its possible use to treat JEV in mouse model. Potential to reduce viral count in brain and subsequent neuronal apoptosis, reduction in mediators of inflammation and oxidative stress, strictly advocate the use of LTHP for treatment of JEV. Thus, the present investigation indorses LTHP as a potentially strong drug candidate for the treatment of JEV infection due to its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-oxidative effect."

The mice in other groups were infected with 105 PFU of JEV, and Rapa, Wort, and CQ were administered 2 h prior to JEV challenge and then administered daily for 10 consecutive days. All mice were monitored for neurological signs and survival. The damage of subcellular structures in the mouse brain was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. The distribution of virus in the mouse brain was determined by RNAScope staining and immunohistochemical staining. The neuroinflammatory responses in the brain were examined via quantitative real-time PCR, and the signal pathways involved in neuroinflammation were identified by Western blot. The mice in the JEV+Wort and JEV+CQ groups showed milder neurological symptoms, less damage to the mitochondria in the brain tissue, and a higher survival rate than those in the JEV+Rapa and JEV groups. Compared with the JEV+Rapa and JEV groups, the distribution of JEV in the brain of mice in the JEV+Wort and JEV+CQ groups was lower, and the inflammatory response was weaker. No significant difference was observed in the expression of the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB pathway in mouse brain among the different groups. Our study suggests that the autophagy inhibitors Wort and CQ reduce JEV infection and weaken the inflammatory response, which does not depend on the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB pathway in mouse brain."

                "abstract": "A mouse-adapted isolate of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), designated as JEV-S3, was generated by serially passaging the P20778 strain of the virus in 3- to 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Blood-brain barrier leakage was evident in JEV-S3-infected mice, in which viral antigens and RNA were consistently demonstrated in the brain, along with infiltration of activated immune cells, as evidenced by an increased CD45+CD11b+ cell population. Histopathology studies showed the presence of perivascular cuffing, haemorrhage and necrotic foci in the virus-infected brain, conforming to the pathological changes seen in the brain of JEV-infected patients. Mass spectrometry studies characterized the molecular events leading to brain inflammation in the infected mice. Notably, a significant induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL6, TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2, was observed. Further, genome sequencing of the JEV-S3 isolate identified the mutations selected during the mouse passage of the virus. Overall, we present an in-depth characterization of a robust and reproducible mouse model of JEV infection. The JEV-S3 isolate will be a useful tool to screen antivirals and study virus pathogenesis in the adolescent mouse model."

                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded small RNA molecules that regulate various cellular processes. miRNA 155 (miR-155) regulates various aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses and plays a key role in various viral infections and the resulting neuroinflammation. The present study evaluated the involvement of miR-155 in modulating Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-induced neuroinflammation. We observed that miR-155 expression was upregulated during JEV infection of mouse primary microglia, the BV-2 microglia cell line, and in both mouse and human brains. In vitro and in vivo knockdown of miR-155 minimized JEV-induced inflammatory responses. In the present study, we confirmed targeting of the Src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) 3' untranslated region (UTR) by miR-155 in the context of JEV infection. Inhibition of SHIP1 by miR-155 resulted in higher beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) and proinflammatory cytokine production through activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1). Based on these observations, we conclude that miR-155 modulates the neuroinflammatory response during JEV infection via negative regulation of SHIP1 expression. Thus, modulation of miR-155 could be a novel strategy to regulate JEV-induced neuroinflammation. IMPORTANCE: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae that causes Japanese encephalitis (JE), is the most common mosquito-borne encephalitis virus in the Asia-Pacific region. The disease is feared, as currently there are no specific antiviral drugs available. JEV targets the central nervous system, leading to high mortality and neurological and psychiatric sequelae in some of those who survive. The level of inflammation correlates well with the clinical outcome in patients. Recently, microRNA (miRNA), a single-stranded noncoding RNA, has been implicated in various brain disorders. The present study investigates the role of miRNA in JEV-induced neuroinflammation. Our results show that miRNA 155 (miR-155) targets the Src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein and promotes inflammation by regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway, increasing the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines and the antiviral response. Thus, miR-155 is a potential therapeutic target to develop antivirals in JE and other brain disorders where inflammation plays a significant role in disease progression."

                "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that invades the central nervous system and causes neuroinflammation and extensive neuronal cell death. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) is a type of pattern recognition receptor that plays a regulatory role in both bacterial and nonbacterial infections. However, the role of NOD1 in JEV-induced neuroinflammation remains undisclosed. In this study, we evaluated the effect of NOD1 activation on the progression of JEV-induced neuroinflammation using a human astrocytic cell line and NOD1 knockout mice. The results showed that JEV infection upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of NOD1, ultimately leading to an enhanced neuroinflammatory response in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of NOD1 in cultured cells or mice significantly abrogated the inflammatory response triggered by JEV infection. Moreover, compared to the wild-type mice, the NOD1 knockout mice showed resistance to JEV infection. Mechanistically, the NOD1-mediated neuroinflammatory response was found to be associated with increased expression or activation/phosphorylation of downstream receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIPK2), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and NF-\u03baB signaling molecules. Thus, NOD1 targeting could be a therapeutic approach to treat Japanese encephalitis. IMPORTANCE Neuroinflammation is the main pathological manifestation of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and the most important factor leading to morbidity and death in humans and animals infected by JEV. An in-depth understanding of the basic mechanisms of neuroinflammation will contribute to research on JE treatment. This study proved that JEV infection can activate the NOD1-RIPK2 signal cascade to induce neuroinflammation through the proven downstream MAPK, ERK, JNK, and NF-\u03baB signal pathway. Thus, our study unveiled NOD1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention for JE."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The crucial role of type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is well known to control central nervous system (CNS) neuroinflammation caused by neurotrophic flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus. However, an in-depth analysis of IFN-I signal-dependent cellular factors that govern CNS-restricted tropism in JEV infection in vivo remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Viral dissemination, tissue tropism, and cytokine production were examined in IFN-I signal-competent and -incompetent mice after JEV inoculation in tissues distal from the CNS such as the footpad. Bone marrow (BM) chimeric models were used for defining hematopoietic and tissue-resident cells in viral dissemination and tissue tropism. RESULTS: The paradoxical and interesting finding was that IFN-I signaling was essentially required for CNS neuroinflammation following JEV inoculation in distal footpad tissue. IFN-I signal-competent mice died after a prolonged neurological illness, but IFN-I signal-incompetent mice all succumbed without neurological signs. Rather, IFN-I signal-incompetent mice developed hemorrhage-like disease as evidenced by thrombocytopenia, functional injury of the liver and kidney, increased vascular leakage, and excessive cytokine production. This hemorrhage-like disease was closely associated with quick viral dissemination and impaired IFN-I innate responses before invasion of JEV into the CNS. Using bone marrow (BM) chimeric models, we found that intrinsic IFN-I signaling in tissue-resident cells in peripheral organs played a major role in inducing the hemorrhage-like disease because IFN-I signal-incompetent recipients of BM cells from IFN-I signal-competent mice showed enhanced viral dissemination, uncontrolled cytokine production, and increased vascular leakage. IFN-I signal-deficient hepatocytes and enterocytes were permissive to JEV replication with impaired induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes, and neuron cells derived from both IFN-I signal-competent and -incompetent mice were vulnerable to JEV replication. Finally, circulating CD11b+Ly-6C+ monocytes infiltrated into the distal tissues inoculated by JEV participated in quick viral dissemination to peripheral organs of IFN-I signal-incompetent mice at an early stage. CONCLUSION: An IFN-I signal-dependent model is proposed to demonstrate how CD11b+Ly-6C+ monocytes are involved in restricting the tissue tropism of JEV to the CNS."

                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) can invade the central nervous system and consequently induce neuroinflammation, which is characterized by profound neuronal cell damage accompanied by astrogliosis and microgliosis. Albeit microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as major regulatory noncoding RNAs with profound effects on inflammatory response, it is unknown how astrocytic miRNAs regulate JEV-induced inflammation. Here, we found the involvement of miR-19b-3p in regulating the JEV-induced inflammatory responsein vitroandin vivo The data demonstrated that miR-19b-3p is upregulated in cultured cells and mouse brain tissues during JEV infection. Overexpression of miR-19b-3p led to increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, after JEV infection, whereas knockdown of miR-19b-3p had completely opposite effects. Mechanistically, miR-19b-3p modulated the JEV-induced inflammatory response via targeting ring finger protein 11, a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappa B signaling. We also found that inhibition of ring finger protein 11 by miR-19b-3p resulted in accumulation of nuclear factor kappa B in the nucleus, which in turn led to higher production of inflammatory cytokines.In vivosilencing of miR-19b-3p by a specific antagomir reinvigorates the expression level of RNF11, which in turn reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, abrogates gliosis and neuronal cell death, and eventually improves the survival rate in the mouse model. Collectively, our results demonstrate that miR-19b-3p positively regulates the JEV-induced inflammatory response. Thus, miR-19b-3p targeting may constitute a thought-provoking approach to rein in JEV-induced inflammation. IMPORTANCE: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is one of the major causes of acute encephalitis in humans worldwide. The pathological features of JEV-induced encephalitis are inflammatory reactions and neurological diseases resulting from glia activation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. Accumulating data indicate that miRNAs regulate a variety of cellular processes, including the host inflammatory response under pathological conditions. Recently, a few studies demonstrated the role of miRNAs in a JEV-induced inflammatory response in microglia; however, their role in an astrocyte-derived inflammatory response is largely unknown. The present study reveals that miR-19b-3p targets ring finger protein 11 in glia and promotes inflammatory cytokine production by enhancing nuclear factor kappa B activity in these cells. Moreover, administration of an miR-19b-3p-specific antagomir in JEV-infected mice reduces neuroinflammation and lethality. These findings suggest a new insight into the molecular mechanism of the JEV-induced inflammatory response and provide a possible therapeutic entry point for treating viral encephalitis."

                "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes acute central nervous system (CNS) disease in humans, in whom the clinical symptoms vary from febrile illness to meningitis and encephalitis. However, the mechanism of severe encephalitis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, using a mouse model, we investigated the pathogenetic mechanisms that correlate with fatal JEV infection. Following extraneural infection with the JaOArS982 strain of JEV, infected mice exhibited clinical signs ranging from mild to fatal outcome. Comparison of the pathogenetic response between severe and mild cases of JaOArS982-infected mice revealed increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the brains of severe cases. However, unexpectedly, the mortality rate of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice was significantly increased compared with that of WT mice, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 plays a protective role against fatal infection. Interestingly, there were no significant differences of viral load in the CNS between WT and TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. However, exaggerated inflammatory responses were observed in the CNS of TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. Although these observations were also obtained in IL-10 KO mice, the mortality and enhanced inflammatory responses were more pronounced in TNF-\u03b1 KO mice. Our findings therefore provide the first evidence that TNF-\u03b1 has an immunoregulatory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS during JEV infection and consequently protects the animals from fatal disease. Thus, we propose that the increased level of TNF-\u03b1 in severe cases was the result of severe disease, and secondly that immunopathological effects contribute to severe neuronal degeneration resulting in fatal disease. In future, further elucidation of the immunoregulatory mechanism of TNF-\u03b1 will be an important priority to enable the development of effective treatment strategies for Japanese encephalitis. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. JEV infection of mice and humans can lead to an uncontrolled inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in a detrimental outcome. Pigs act as important amplification and reservoir hosts, and JEV infection of pigs is mostly subclinical. Information on virus spread in the CNS and immune responses controlling JEV infection in the CNS of pigs, however remains scarce. METHODS: Nine-week-old pigs were inoculated intranasal or intradermal with a relevant dose of 105 TCID50 of JEV genotype 3 Nakayama strain. Clinical signs were assessed daily, and viral spread was followed by RT-qPCR. mRNA expression profiles were determined to study immune responses in the CNS. RESULTS: Besides a delay of 2\u2009days to reach the peak viremia upon intranasal compared to intradermal inoculation, the overall virus spread via both inoculation routes was highly similar. JEV appearance in lymphoid and visceral organs was in line with a blood-borne JEV dissemination. JEV showed a particular tropism to the CNS but without the induction of neurological signs. JEV entry in the CNS probably occurred via different hematogenous and neuronal pathways, but replication in the brain was mostly efficiently suppressed and associated with a type I IFN-independent activation of OAS1 expression. In the olfactory bulb and thalamus, where JEV replication was not completely controlled by this mechanism, a short but strong induction of chemokine gene expression was detected. An increased IFNy expression was simultaneously observed, probably originating from infiltrating T cells, correlating with a fast suppression of JEV replication. The chemokine response was however not associated with the induction of a strong inflammatory response, nor was an induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that an adequate antiviral response and an attenuated inflammatory response contribute to a favorable outcome of JEV infection in pigs and help to explain the limited neurological disease compared to other hosts. We show that the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key mediator of neurologic disease in mice, is not upregulated in pigs, further supporting its important role in JEV infections."

                "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from damage by exogenous molecules. Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by a neurotropic flavivirus, leads to inflammation in the CNS, neuronal death and also compromises the structural and functional integrity of the BBB. Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, has been found to be broadly protective in neurological disease models featuring inflammation and cell death and at present, is being evaluated in clinical trials. In the present study, we propose that the neuroprotective role of minocycline in experimental models of JE extends also to the protection of the BBB. Damage to the BBB was assessed by Evan's blue dye exclusion test after minocycline treatment following Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. A breakdown of the BBB occurred in mice inoculated intravenously with JEV. This resulted in leakage of protein-bound Evan's blue dye into the brain tissue. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed an up-regulation of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules following JEV infection. Immunostaining showed leukocyte and neutrophil infiltration following JEV infection. Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline, beginning 24h post-JEV infection, abrogated the effects by reducing BBB damage, decreasing expression of iNOS, Cox-2, VEGF and also by reducing the elevated level of transcript of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules in the brain. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to disrupt the BBB and minocycline was found to significantly decrease the activity of MMP-9 in brain tissue homogenates. Thus, minocycline, administered at a clinically relevant time, appears to maintain blood-brain barrier integrity following JEV infection."

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is a key factor that mediates immunopathology in the central nervous system (CNS) during JE. Etanercept is a safe anti-TNF-\u03b1 drug that has been commonly used in the treatment of various human autoimmune diseases. METHODS: The effect of etanercept on JE was investigated with a JEV-infected mouse model. Four groups of mice were assigned to receive injections of phosphate-buffered saline, etanercept, JEV, or JEV plus etanercept. Inflammatory responses in mouse brains and mortality of mice were evaluated within 23 days post infection. RESULTS: The in vitro assay with mouse neuron/glia cultures showed that etanercept treatment reduced the inflammatory response induced by JEV infection. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that administration of etanercept protected mice from JEV-induced lethality. Neuronal damage, glial activation, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines were found to be markedly decreased in JEV-infected mice that received etanercept treatment. Additionally, etanercept treatment restored the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and reduced viral load in mouse brains. CONCLUSIONS: Etanercept effectively reduces the inflammation and provides protection against acute encephalitis in a JEV-infected mouse model."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The laboratory mouse model is commonly employed to study the pathogenesis of encephalitic flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). However, it is known that some strains of these viruses do not elicit a typical mortality dose response curve from this organism after peripheral infection and the reason for it has not yet been fully understood. It is suggested that induction of more vigorous Type-I IFN (IFN-I) response might control early virus dissemination following increasing infectious challenge doses of the virus. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine this suggested role of IFN-I in the mortality of mice infected with various doses of JEV. METHODS: Inbred 129 mice and their IFNAR KO (A129) mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 100, 102, 104 or 106 pfu of JaOArS982 strain of JEV. Mice were weighed daily and observed for clinical signs. Virus titers in the brains and spleens of JEV-infected mice were determined by plaque forming assays. The upregulated mRNA levels of genes related to IFN-I response of mice were examined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The mortality rates of 129 mice infected with JaOArS982 did not significantly increase despite the increase in inoculation dose and no significant difference of viral loads was observed between their brains. However, there was clear elevation of the mRNA levels of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3, IRF7, IRF9, MDA5 and RIG-I at 24 hours post-infection depending on the inoculation dose. In A129 mice, length of survival days and the viral loads of spleen and brain were observed to be inoculation dose-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: From these results, it is suggested that early IFN-I response elicited by high inoculation doses of JEV provides an anti-viral effect during the early phase of infection. Accordingly, virus replication is counteracted by IFN-I response at each increasing inoculation dose resulting in the interference of impending severe disease course or fatal outcome; hence, this might explain the inoculation dose-independent mortality in mice caused by Japanese encephalitis virus."

Some neurotropic viruses can reach the brain following infection through ocular route. This study was undertaken to establish JEV-induced clinical disease in mouse model through conjunctival route and document the neuropathological effects. Methods: Ten two-week old Swiss albino mice were inoculated with 5 \u03bcl Vero cell cultured virus containing 104.7 TCID50 JEV through conjunctival route. Clinical signs of mice were observed twice daily. After necropsy examination, different organs including eyes and olfactory bulbs were collected for histopathological examination, quantification of viral copy number and antigen by real-time TaqMan assay and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Infected mice showed characteristic clinical signs of JE by 4 days post-infection (dpi). Histopathological lesions in brain included perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells, focal gliosis, necrosis of neurons and neuronophagia and astrocytosis in the cerebrum, cerebellum and the brainstem. JEV viral load was highest in the brain followed by intestine, heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. JEV antigen was detected in the bipolar and ganglion cells of the retina and in the mitral cells and periglomerular cells of olfactory bulb and other parts of the brain. Interpretation & conclusions: JEV infection in mice through conjunctival route produced characteristic clinical signs of the disease and neuropathological lesions. Demonstration of JEV antigen in association with neuropathological lesions in the central nervous system and neuronal cells of the eye showed that conjunctival route could be an effective alternate route for virus invasion into the brain. These findings have biosafety implications for researchers, veterinary practitioners and pig farmers."

            "abstract": "Sympathetic dysfunction is suggested to contribute to development of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) alike. Considering important role of microglia in development/resolution of neuroinflammation, contribution of noradrenaline, the key sympathetic end-point mediator, in modulation of microglial phenotypic and functional properties in rat EAE model was examined. The study showed that noradrenaline acting in neurocrine and autocrine/paracrine way might influence microglia during EAE. Propranolol treatment over the effector phase moderated EAE course. This was associated with the increased proportion of microglia expressing CX3CR1, the key molecule in their immunomodulatory/neuroprotective action, and upregulation of CX3CR1 downstream Nrf2 gene. This correlated with the increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and phagocytic capacity of microglia, and their phenotypic changes mirrored in increased proportion of CD163- and CD83-expressing cells. The enhanced HO-1 expression was linked with the decreased proportion of microglial cells expressing IL-1\u03b2 and IL-23, and possibly IL-6, followed by increased proportion of IL-10-expressing microglia, and downregulated MCP-1/CCL2 expression. Consistently, spinal cord infiltration with blood-borne myeloid and CD4+ T cells, as well as CD4+ T-cell reactivation/proliferation and differentiation into highly pathogenic IL-17+ cells co-producing IFN-\u03b3 and GM-CSF were decreased in propranolol-treated rats compared with saline-injected controls. The in vitro investigations of the effects of noradrenaline on microglia showed that noradrenaline through \u03b2-adrenoceptor may influence Nrf2 expression also via CX3CR1-independent route. The study suggests \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated neuroinflammation-promoting role of noradrenaline in EAE via modulation of microglial Nrf2 expression, and thereby forms the basis for further translational pharmacological research to improve multiple sclerosis therapy."

                "abstract": "The signaling axis of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been an important component in overcoming diabetes, and recent reports have uncovered novel beneficial roles of this signaling axis in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia, accelerating processes for exendin-4 repositioning. Here, we studied whether multiple sclerosis (MS) could be a complement to the CNS disorders that are associated with the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis. Both components of the signaling axis, GLP-1 and GLP-1R proteins, are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the spinal cord of normal mice. In particular, they are abundant in Iba1-positive microglia. Upon challenge by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, the mRNA expression of both GLP-1 and GLP-1R was markedly downregulated in EAE-symptomatic spinal cords, indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in EAE. Such a downregulation obviously occurred in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia, a main cell type to express both GLP-1 and GLP-1R, further indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in activated microglia. To investigate whether increased activity of GLP-1R has a therapeutic benefit, exendin-4 (5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.p.), a GLP-1R agonist, was administered daily to EAE-symptomatic mice. Exendin-4 administration to symptomatic EAE mice significantly improved the clinical signs of the disease, along with the reversal of histopathological sequelae such as cell accumulation, demyelination, astrogliosis, microglial activation, and morphological transformation of activated microglia in the injured spinal cord. Such an improvement by exendin-4 was comparable to that by FTY720 (3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), a drug for MS. The neuroprotective effects of exendin-4 against EAE were also associated with decreased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, all of which are usually upregulated in injured sites of the EAE spinal cord. Interestingly, exendin-4 exposure similarly reduced mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-stimulated microglia. Furthermore, exendin-4 administration significantly attenuated activation of NF-\u03baB signaling in EAE spinal cord and LPS-stimulated microglia. Collectively, the current study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of exendin-4 for MS by reducing immune responses in the CNS, highlighting the importance of the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for MS."

                "abstract": "The preventive and therapeutic mechanisms in multiple sclerosis are not clearly understood. We investigated whether Hyungbangpaedok-san (HBPDS), a traditional herbal medicine, has a beneficial effect in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG 35-55). Onset-treatment with 4 types of HBPDS (extracted using distilled water and 30%/70%/100% ethanol as the solvent) alleviated neurological signs, and HBPDS extracted within 30% ethanol (henceforth called HBPDS) was more effective. Onset-treatment with HBPDS reduced demyelination and the recruitment/infiltration and activation of microglia/macrophages in the spinal cord of EAE mice, which corresponded to the reduced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2), iNOS, and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, and RANTES) in the spinal cord. Onset-treatment with HBPDS inhibited changes in the components of the blood-brain barrier such as astrocytes, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and junctional molecules (claudin-3, claudin-5, and zona occludens-1) in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Onset-treatment with HBPDS reduced the elevated population of CD4+, CD4+/IFN-\u03b3+, and CD4+/IL-17+ T cells in the spinal cord of EAE mice but it further increased the elevated population of CD4+/CD25+/Foxp3+ and CD4+/Foxp3+/Helios+ T cells. Pre-, onset-, post-, but not peak-treatment, with HBPDS had a beneficial effect on behavioral impairment in EAE mice. Taken together, HBPDS could alleviate the development/progression of EAE by regulating the recruitment/infiltration and activation of microglia and peripheral immune cells (macrophages, Th1, Th17, and Treg cells) in the spinal cord. These findings could help to develop protective strategies using HBPDS in the treatment of autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis."

                "title": "Dual roles of the adenosine A2a receptor in autoimmune neuroinflammation.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conditions of inflammatory tissue distress are associated with high extracellular levels of adenosine, due to increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation upon cellular stress or the release of extracellular ATP upon cell death, which can be degraded to adenosine by membrane-bound ecto-enzymes like CD39 and CD73. Adenosine is recognised to mediate anti-inflammatory effects via the adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR), as shown in experimental models of arthritis. Here, using pharmacological interventions and genetic inactivation, we investigated the roles of A2aR in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: We used two independent mouse EAE variants, i.e. active immunization in C57BL/6 with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 or transfer-EAE by proteolipid protein (PLP)139-155-stimulated T lymphocytes and EAE in mice treated with A2aR-agonist CGS21680 at different stages of disease course and in mice lacking A2aR (A2aR(-/-)) compared to direct wild-type littermates. In EAE, we analysed myelin-specific proliferation and cytokine synthesis ex vivo, as well as inflammation and demyelination by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we investigated the effect of A2aR on migration of CD4(+) T cells, macrophages and microglia, as well as the impact of A2aR on phagocytosis of macrophages and microglia. Statistical tests were Mann-Whitney U and Student's t test. RESULTS: We found an upregulation of A2aR in the central nervous system (CNS) in EAE, predominantly detected on T cells and macrophages/microglia within the inflamed tissue. Preventive EAE treatment with A2aR-specific agonist inhibited myelin-specific T cell proliferation ex vivo and ameliorated disease, while application of the same agonist after disease onset exacerbated non-remitting EAE progression and resulted in more severe tissue destruction. Accordingly, A2aR-deficient mice showed accelerated and exacerbated disease manifestation with increased frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-, IL-17- and GM-CSF-producing CD4(+) T helper cells and higher numbers of inflammatory lesions in the early stage. However, EAE quickly ameliorated and myelin debris accumulation was lower in A2aR(-/-) mice. In vitro, activation of A2aR inhibited phagocytosis of myelin by macrophages and primary microglia as well as migration of CD4(+) T cells, macrophages and primary microglia. CONCLUSIONS: A2aR activation exerts a complex pattern in chronic autoimmune neurodegeneration: while providing anti-inflammatory effects on T cells and thus protection at early stages, A2aR seems to play a detrimental role during later stages of disease and may thus contribute to sustained tissue damage within the inflamed CNS."

                "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-33, a member of the IL-1 cytokine family, is highly expressed in central nervous system (CNS), suggesting its potential role in CNS. Although some studies have focused on the role of IL-33 in multiple sclerosis (MS) / experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination and axonal damage in CNS, the exact role of IL-33 in MS/EAE remains unclear and controversial. Here, we used IL-33 knockout mice to clarify the role of endogenous IL-33 in EAE by simultaneously eliminating its role as a nuclear transcription factor and an extracellular cytokine. We found that the clinical score in IL-33 knockout EAE mice was higher accompanied by more severe demyelination compared with the wild-type (WT) EAE mice. As for the main immune cells participating in EAE in IL-33 knockout mice, pathogenic effector T cells increased both in peripheral immune organs and CNS, while CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells decreased in spleen and lymph nodes, Th2 cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in CNS. Additionally, the populations of microglia/macrophages and CD11C+CD11B+ dendritic cells (DCs) increased in CNS of IL-33 knockout mice with EAE, among which iNOS-producing microglia/macrophages increased. Moreover, resident astrocytes/microglia were more activated in IL-33 knockout mice with EAE. In vitro, after blocking the IL-33, the proliferation of primary astrocytes, the production of MCP-1/CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 by astrocytes, and the production of TNF-\u03b1 by primary microglia stimulated by the homogenate of the peak stage of EAE were increased. Our results indicate that IL-33 plays a protective role in EAE and exerts extensive influences on multiple immune cells and neural cells involved in EAE."

                "abstract": "Dark Agouti (DA) rats are highly susceptible to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), still they completely recover from the disease. Here, we were interested to determine contribution of major anti-inflammatory cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and interleukin (IL)-10 to the recovery of DA rats from EAE. To that extent we determined CNS expression of these cytokines in DA rats at different phases of EAE and compared data to those obtained in EAE-resistant Albino Oxford (AO) rats. Higher expression of TGF-\u03b2 was persistently observed in the CNS of AO rats, even if rats were not immunized. This implied that high TGF-\u03b2 within the CNS is important for resistance of AO rats to EAE induction. On the contrary, IL-10 expression was consistently higher in DA than in AO rats and it culminated at the peak of EAE. Methylprednisolone suppressed EAE and expression of IL-10 in spinal cord homogenates, while IL-10 was increased in CNS-infiltrating immune cells. This implied that IL-10 might have a significant role in recovery of DA rats from the disease. Thus, we next explored effects of IL-10 on astrocytes, glial cells that largely contribute to control of CNS inflammation. IL-10 stimulated astrocytic expression of an important regulator of neuroinflammation, CXCL12. Thus, IL-10 might contribute to recovery of DA rats from EAE through induction of CXCL12 expression in astrocytes. "

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by demyelination, immune cell infiltration, and axonal damage. Herein, we sought to investigate the influence of physical exercise on mice experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a reported MS model. Data show that both strength and endurance training protocols consistently prevented clinical signs of EAE and decreased oxidative stress, an effect which was likely due to improving genomic antioxidant defense-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)/antioxidant response elements (ARE) pathway-in the CNS. In addition, physical exercise inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-1\u03b2 in the spinal cord of mice with EAE. Of note, spleen cells obtained from strength training group incubated with MOG35-55 showed a significant upregulation of CD25 and IL-10 levels, with a decrease of IL-6, MCP-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production, mainly, during acute and chronic phase of EAE. Moreover, these immunomodulatory effects of exercise were associated with reduced expression of adhesion molecules, especially of platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). Finally, physical exercise also restored the expression of tight junctions in spinal cord. Together, these results demonstrate that mild/moderate physical exercise, when performed regularly in mice, consistently attenuates the progression and pathological hallmarks of EAE, thereby representing an important non-pharmacological intervention for the improvement of immune-mediated diseases such as MS. Graphical Abstract Schematic diagram illustrating the beneficial effects of physical exercise during experimental model of MS. Physical exercise, especially strength (ST) and endurance (ET) training protocols, inhibits the development and progression of disease, measured by the mean maximal clinical score (1.5 and 1.0, respectively), with inhibition of 30 % and 50 %, respectively, based on the AUC, compared with EAEuntreated group. In addition, ST and ET decreased oxidative stress, possibly, through genomic antioxidant defense, Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway, in the CNS. Physical exercise inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-17 and IL-1\u03b2 in the spinal cord after EAE induction, as well as spleen cells obtained from ST group showed a significant upregulation of regulatory T cell markers, such as CD25 and IL-10 levels, and blocked IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 production, mainly, during acute and chronic phase of EAE. Finally, these immunomodulatory effects of exercise were associated with inhibition of adhesion molecules and reestablishment of tight junctions expression in spinal cord tissue, thereby limiting BBB permeability and transmigration of autoreactive T cells to the CNS.

                "abstract": "Our previous studies showed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in male compared with female adult rats, and moderating effect of propranolol-induced \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade on EAE in females, the effect associated with transcriptional stimulation of Nrf2/HO-1 axis in spinal cord microglia. This study examined putative sexual dimorphism in propranolol action on EAE severity. Propranolol treatment beginning from the onset of clinical EAE mitigated EAE severity in rats of both sexes, but to a greater extent in males exhibiting higher noradrenaline levels and myeloid cell \u03b22-adrenoceptor expression in spinal cord. This correlated with more prominent stimulatory effects of propranolol not only on CX3CL1/CX3CR1/Nrf2/HO-1 cascade, but also on Stat3/Socs3 signaling axis in spinal cord microglia/myeloid cells (mirrored in the decreased Stat3 and the increased Socs3 expression) from male rats compared with their female counterparts. Propranolol diminished the frequency of activated cells among microglia, increased their phagocyting/endocyting capacity, and shifted cytokine secretory profile of microglia/blood-borne myeloid cells towards an anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective phenotype. Additionally, it downregulated the expression of chemokines (CCL2, CCL19/21) driving T-cell/monocyte trafficking into spinal cord. Consequently, in propranolol-treated rats fewer activated CD4+\u2009T cells and IL-17+\u2009T cells, including CD4+IL17+\u2009cells coexpressing IFN-\u03b3/GM-CSF, were recovered from spinal cord of propranolol-treated rats compared with sex-matched saline-injected controls. All the effects of propranolol were more prominent in males. The study as a whole disclosed that sexual dimorphism in multiple molecular mechanisms implicated in EAE development may be responsible for greater severity of EAE in male rats and sexually dimorphic action of substances affecting them. Propranolol moderated EAE severity more effectively in male rats, exhibiting greater spinal cord noradrenaline (NA) levels and myeloid cell \u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22-AR) expression than females. Propranolol affected CX3CR1/Nrf2/HO-1 and Stat3/Socs3 signaling axes in myeloid cells, favored their anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective phenotype and, consequently, reduced Th cell reactivation and differentiation into highly pathogenic IL-17/IFN-\u03b3/GM-CSF-producing cells."

The mechanism by which CB1R inhibition exerts inflammatory effects is still unclear. Here, we explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CB1R in the treatment of EAE by using a specific and selective CB1R antagonist SR141716A. Our study demonstrated that SR141716A accelerated the clinical onset and development of EAE, accompanied by body weight loss. SR141716A significantly up-regulated the expression of toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and nuclear factor-kappaB/p65 (NF-\u03baB/p65) on microglia/macrophages of EAE mice as well as levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1, CX3CL1), accompanied by the shifts of cytokines from Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) to Th1 (IFN-\u03b3)/Th17 (IL-17) in the spinal cords of EAE mice. Similar changes happened on splenic mononuclear cells (MNCs) except chemokine CX3CL1. Consistently, SR141716A promoted BV-2 microglia to release inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) while inhibited the production of IL-10 and chemokines (MCP-1, CX3CL1). Furthermore, when splenic CD4+ T cells co-cultured with SR141716A-administered BV-2 microglia, the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were decreased while production of IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 increased significantly. Our research indicated that inhibition of CB1R induced M1 phenotype-Th17 axis changed of microglia/macrophages through TLR-4 and NF-\u03baB/p65 which accelerated the onset and development of EAE. Therefore, CB1R may be a promising target for the treatment of MS/EAE, but its complexity remains to be carefully considered and studied in further clinical application."

                "abstract": "Activation states of immune cells (among them, the so-called pro- or anti-inflammatory states) influence the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) can exert a pro- or anti-inflammatory role in a context-dependent manner. In mice CGRP was found to attenuate the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a common MS animal model). We analyzed CGRP effects on the expression of cytokines and markers of activation states, as well as its intracellular cascade, following intrathecal administration during EAE immunization. Real Time quantitative-PCR (RT-PCR) showed that IL-1beta and IL-6 (associated to a pro-inflammatory state in EAE), but also Ym1 (also known as Chil3), Arg1 and CD163 (associated to an anti-inflammatory state in EAE) were decreased in the encephalon (devoid of cerebellum). In the cerebellum itself, IL-1beta and Ym1 were decreased. TNF-alpha (associated to a pro-inflammatory state in EAE), but also IL-10 (associated to another type of anti-inflammatory state) and BDNF were unchanged in these two regions. No changes were detected in the spinal cord. Additional tendencies toward a change (as revealed by RT-PCR) were again decreases: IL-10 in the encephalon and Arg1 in the spinal cord. CGRP decreased percentage of Ym1+/CD68+ immunoreactive cells and cell density of infiltrates in the cervical spinal cord pia mater. Instead, Ym1 in the underlying parenchyma and at thoracic and lumbar levels, as well as Arg1, were unchanged. In cultured microglia the neuropeptide decreased Ym1, but not Arg1, immunoreactivity. Inducible NOS (iNOS) was unchanged in spinal cord microglia and astrocytes. The neuropeptide increased the activation of ERK1/2 in the astrocytes of the spinal cord and in culture, but did not influence the activation of ERK1/2 or p38 in the spinal cord microglia. Finally, in areas adjacent to infiltration sites CGRP-treated microglia showed a larger ramification radius. In conclusion, CGRP-induced EAE amelioration was associated to a concomitant, context-dependent decrease in the expression of markers belonging to both pro- or anti-inflammatory activation states of immune cells. It can be hypothesized that CGRP-induced EAE attenuation is obtained through a novel mechanism that promotes down-regulation of immune cell activation that facilitates the establishment of a beneficial environment in EAE provided possibly also by other factors."

Recently we and others have demonstrated the protective effect of ABHD6 inhibition in the animal models of traumatic brain injury and epileptic seizures. In this study, we investigated the role of targeting ABHD6 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Post-symptom treatment with an ABHD6 inhibitor WWL70 increased the brain levels of 2-AG and ameliorated the clinical signs of EAE, T cells infiltration, microglia activation and the expression of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecules. The production of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB were also significantly reduced by WWL70 treatment. The neuroprotective effect of WWL70 was demonstrated by increased survival of mature oligodendrocytes, reduced demyelination and axonal loss in WWL70 treated EAE mouse spinal cord. The therapeutic effect of WWL70 on EAE was absent by co-administration of CB2 receptor antagonist, but not CB1 receptor antagonist. Consistently, WWL70 did not afford any protection in CB2 receptor knockout mice after EAE induction. Given the increased expression of ABHD6 in microglia/macrophages, but not in T cells, we speculated that inhibition of ABHD6 might enhance 2-AG signaling particularly in microglia/macrophages to exert anti-inflammatory effects via activation of CB2 receptors. These results suggest that inhibition of ABHD6 might be used as an ideal strategy for the treatment of MS and other neurodegenerative diseases. "

                "abstract": "Aging is associated with the decline in immune response to infectious agents and tumors and increasing risk of autoimmunity, but the incidence of autoimmune diseases does not increase in the elderly. To elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms influencing clinical expression of autoimmunity in aged animals, the phenotypic and functional characteristics of mononuclear cells isolated from the spinal cords of 3-month-old (young) and 26-month-old (aged) Dark Agouti rats immunized to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) - the model of multiple sclerosis, the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, were examined. Aged rats were less susceptible to EAE induction, and the neurological and histological picture was milder in those rats which developed the clinically manifested disease. At the peak of the disease, several times fewer mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes were isolated from the spinal cords of aged rats compared with the young ones. The frequency of CD4+ cells among TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ lymphocytes, as well as that of reactivated CD134(OX40)+ cells within its CD4+ T-lymphocyte subpopulation, was less in spinal cords of aged compared with young rats. Additionally, CD134 surface density on CD4+ lymphocytes was decreased in the spinal cord of aged rats. The changes in CD134 expression most likely reflected in part age-related intrinsic changes in CD4+ lymphocytes as the expression of this molecule was also impaired on in vitro stimulated na\u00efve CD4+ splenocytes from aged rats compared with young animals. In addition, greater frequency of CD8+ lymphocytes with regulatory phenotypes could also contribute to impaired CD4+ cell reactivation in aged rats. The increased apoptosis of CD4+ cells from aged rats was consistent with their impaired reactivation and it was accompanied by the greater frequency of CD4+CD11b+CD45(int/high) cells, which are supposed to be actively engaged in apoptotic cell phagocytosis and to have immunoregulatory properties. Compared with young rats, following short-term PMA and ionomycin stimulation in vitro, the frequency of IL-17+ and IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T lymphocytes among the spinal cord mononuclear cells from aged rats and the cytokine expression density on a per lymphocyte basis were reduced. Additionally, the increase in the proportion of autoregulatory IL-17+IL-10+ cells on the account of proinflammatory IL-17+IFN-\u03b3+ cells within IL-17+ lymphocytes suggested their lower pathogenic capacity in aged rats. This most likely reflected alterations in the aged rat spinal cord cytokine milieu, which were mirrored in a diminished expression of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA followed by an enhanced expression of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA. Overall, the study points to age-related changes in T lymphocytes and other cells from the spinal cord infiltrate which could contribute to the decreased susceptibility of aged rats to the induction of EAE.

Although there is evidence linking CD4(+) T cells that secrete IL-17, termed Th17 cells, and IFN-gamma-secreting Th1 cells with the pathogenesis of EAE, the precise contribution of these T cell subtypes or their associated cytokines is still unclear. We have investigated the infiltration of CD4(+) T cells that secrete IFN-gamma, IL-17 or both cytokines into CNS during development of EAE and have examined the role of T cells in microglial activation. Our findings demonstrate that Th17 cells and CD4(+) T cells that produce both IFN-gamma and IL-17, which we have called Th1/Th17 cells, infiltrate the brain prior to the development of clinical symptoms of EAE and that this coincides with activation of CD11b(+) microglia and local production of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the CNS. In contrast, significant infiltration of Th1 cells was only detected after the development of clinical disease. Co-culture experiments, using mixed glia and MOG-specific T cells, revealed that T cells that secreted IFN-gamma and IL-17 were potent activators of pro-inflammatory cytokines but T cells that secrete IFN-gamma, but not IL-17, were less effective. In contrast both Th1 and Th1/Th17 cells enhanced MHC-class II and co-stimulatory molecule expression on microglia. Our findings suggest that T cells which secrete IL-17 or IL-17 and IFN-gamma infiltrate the CNS prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of EAE, where they may mediate CNS inflammation, in part, through microglial activation."

                "abstract": "The increased activity of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in various inflammatory and fibrotic conditions results in the development of numerous disease processes. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is mediated by many inflammatory cytokines and mediators. We examined the role of TG2 in encephalitogenic CD4(+) T cell responses and EAE development using mice lacking TG2 (TG2(-/-)). TG2(-/-) mice showed decreased disease severity as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment with cysteamine, a TG2 inhibitor, ameliorated disease severity in WT mice. Exacerbated disability in WT mice resulted from the increased infiltration of cytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells and sustained expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the lesion. The increased number of IL-17- and IFN-\u03b3-producing cells in the spinal cord resulted from peripheral expansion of these cells after immunization with myelin-derived antigen. In vitro differentiation of WT and TG2(-/-) splenocytes revealed that proliferation and activation-induced cell death did not differ, but differentiation into IL-17- or IFN-\u03b3-producing cells was increased in WT mice. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that pathogenic CD4(+) T cell differentiation and disease progression were caused by both the T cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic effects of TG2. This study is the first to report a pathogenic role for TG2 in the EAE progress and suggests that therapeutic targeting of TG2 may be effective against multiple sclerosis."

In rats of both sexes, DMF administration from the day of immunization attenuated EAE severity, but this effect was more prominent in males leading to loss of the sexual dimorphism observed in vehicle-administered controls. Consistently, in male rats, DMF was more efficient in diminishing the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes infiltrating spinal cord (SC) and their reactivation, the number of IL-17+ T lymphocytes and particularly cellularity of their highly pathogenic IFN-\u03b3+GM-CSF+IL-17+ subset. This was linked with changes in SC CD11b+CD45+TCR\u03b1\u03b2- microglia/proinflammatory monocyte progeny, substantiated in a more prominent increase in the frequency of anti-inflammatory phygocyting CD163+ cells and the cells expressing high surface levels of immunoregulatory CD83 molecule (associated with apoptotic cells phagocytosis and implicated in downregulation of CD4+ T lymphocyte reactivation) among CD11b+CD45+TCR\u03b1\u03b2- cells in male rat SC. These changes were associated with greater increase in the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like\u00a02 expression in male rats administered with DMF. In accordance with the previous findings, DMF diminished reactive nitrogen and oxygen species generation and consistently, SC level of advanced oxidation protein products, to the greater extent in male rats. Overall, our study indicates sex-specificity in the sensitivity of DMF cellular and molecular targets and encourages sex-based clinical research to define significance of sex for action of therapeutic agents moderating autoimmune neuroinflammation-/oxidative stress-related nervous tissue damage."

                "abstract": "Compelling evidence has shown that interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 has dual effects in multiple sclerosis and in its animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), with results supporting both a pathogenic and beneficial function. However, the mechanisms whereby IFN-\u03b3 may promote neuroprotection in EAE and its effects on central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells have remained an enigma for more than 30 years. In this study, the impact of IFN-\u03b3 at the peak of EAE, its effects on CNS infiltrating myeloid cells (MC) and microglia (MG), and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms were investigated. IFN-\u03b3 administration resulted in disease amelioration and attenuation of neuroinflammation associated with significantly lower frequencies of CNS CD11b+ myeloid cells and less infiltration of inflammatory cells and demyelination. A significant reduction in activated MG and enhanced resting MG was determined by flow cytometry and immunohistrochemistry. Primary MC/MG cultures obtained from the spinal cord of IFN-\u03b3-treated EAE mice that were ex vivo re-stimulated with a low dose (1 ng/ml) of IFN-\u03b3 and neuroantigen, promoted a significantly higher induction of CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells associated with increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 secretion. Additionally, IFN-\u03b3-treated primary MC/MG cultures produced significantly lower nitrite in response to LPS challenge than control MC/MG. IFN-\u03b3-treated EAE mice had a significantly higher frequency of CX3CR1high MC/MG and expressed lower levels of program death ligand 1 (PD-L1) than PBS-treated mice. Most CX3CR1highPD-L1lowCD11b+Ly6G- cells expressed MG markers (Tmem119, Sall2, and P2ry12), indicating that they represented an enriched MG subset (CX3CR1highPD-L1low MG). Amelioration of clinical symptoms and induction of CX3CR1highPD-L1low MG by IFN-\u03b3 were dependent on STAT-1. RNA-seq analyses revealed that in vivo treatment with IFN-\u03b3 promoted the induction of homeostatic CX3CR1highPD-L1low MG, upregulating the expression of genes associated with tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory roles and down-regulating pro-inflammatory genes. These analyses highlight the master role that IFN-\u03b3 plays in regulating microglial activity and provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic activity of IFN-\u03b3 in EAE."

IFN-\u03b2 is used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) and is effective against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. Mice with EAE show elevated levels of Type I IFNs in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting a role for endogenous Type I IFN during inflammation. However, the therapeutic benefit of Type I IFN produced in the CNS remains to be established. The aim of this study was to examine whether experimentally induced CNS-endogenous Type I IFN influences EAE. Using IFN-\u03b2 reporter mice, we showed that direct administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b2, into the cerebrospinal fluid induced increased leukocyte numbers and transient upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 in CD45/CD11b-positive cells located in the meninges and choroid plexus, as well as enhanced IFN-\u03b2 expression by parenchymal microglial cells. Intrathecal injection of poly I:C to mice showing first symptoms of EAE substantially increased the normal disease-associated expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, interferon regulatory factor-7 and IL-10 in CNS, and disease worsening was prevented for as long as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was expressed. In contrast, there was no therapeutic effect on EAE in poly I:C-treated IFN receptor-deficient mice. IFN-dependent microglial and astrocyte response included production of the chemokine CXCL10. These results show that Type I IFN induced within the CNS can play a protective role in EAE and highlight the role of endogenous type I IFN in mediating neuroprotection. "

The generation of neuroantigen-specific GM-CSF+ Th lymphocytes was impaired in dLNs of AO rats (relatively resistant to EAE induction) compared with their DA counterparts (susceptible to EAE) reflecting impaired CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation and less supportive of GM-CSF+ Th cell differentiation dLN cytokine microenvironment. Immunophenotyping of GM-CSF+ Th cells showed their phenotypic heterogeneity in both strains and revealed lower frequency of IL-17+IFN-\u03b3+, IL-17+IFN-\u03b3-, and IL-17-IFN-\u03b3+ cells accompanied by higher frequency of IL-17-IFN-\u03b3- cells among them in AO than in DA rats. Compared with DA, in AO rats was also found (i) slightly lower surface density of CCR2 (drives accumulation of highly pathogenic GM-CSF+IFN-\u03b3+ Th17 cells in SC) on GM-CSF+IFN-\u03b3+ Th17 lymphocytes from dLNs, and (ii) diminished CCL2 mRNA expression in SC tissue, suggesting their impaired migration into the SC. Moreover, dLN and SC cytokine environments in AO rats were shown to be less supportive of GM-CSF+IFN-\u03b3+ Th17 cell differentiation (judging by lower expression of mRNAs for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-23/p19). In accordance with the (i) lower frequency of GM-CSF+ Th cells in dLNs and SC of AO rats and their lower GM-CSF production, and (ii) impaired CCL2 expression in the SC tissue, the proportion of proinflammatory monocytes among peripheral blood cells and their progeny (CD45hi cells) among the SC CD11b+ cells were reduced in AO compared with DA rats. Collectively, the results indicate that the strain specificities in efficacy of several mechanisms controlling (auto)reactive CD4+ lymphocyte expansion/differentiation into the cells with pathogenic phenotype and migration of the latter to the SC contribute to AO rat resistance to EAE."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves a misdirected immune attack against myelin in the brain and spinal cord, leading to profound neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. While the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis have been widely studied, the suppression mechanisms that lead to the resolution of the autoimmune response are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the C-type lectin receptor macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), usually expressed on tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as a negative regulator of autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation. METHODS: We used in silico, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis to explore the expression and functionality of MGL in human macrophages and microglia, as well as in MS post-mortem tissue. In vitro, we studied the capacity of MGL to mediate apoptosis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-derived T cells and mouse CD4+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated in vivo and ex vivo the immunomodulatory potential of MGL in EAE. RESULTS: MGL plays a critical role in the resolution phase of EAE as MGL1-deficient (Clec10a-/-) mice showed a similar day of onset but experienced a higher clinical score to that of WT littermates. We demonstrate that the mouse ortholog MGL1 induces apoptosis of autoreactive T cells and diminishes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory autoantibodies. Moreover, we show that MGL1 but not MGL2 induces apoptosis of activated mouse CD4+ T cells in vitro. In human settings, we show that MGL expression is increased in active MS lesions and on alternatively activated microglia and macrophages which, in turn, induces the secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, underscoring the clinical relevance of this lectin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a new role of MGL-expressing APCs as an anti-inflammatory mechanism in autoimmune neuroinflammation by dampening pathogenic T and B cell responses, uncovering a novel clue for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies with relevance for in MS clinical applications."

Upon immunization for EAE, 22-24-month-old Albino Oxford (AO) rats developed milder neurological deficit of prolonged duration compared with their Dark Agouti (DA) counterparts. Consistently, they exhibited: (i) diminished neuroantigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte generation in draining lymph nodes (reflecting lower density of high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex on their surface and higher CD4+FoxP3+CD25+ regulatory cell frequency); (ii) less favorable spinal cord expression of CXCL12 and CCL2, and consequently diminished infiltration of neuroantigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes, including highly pathogenic IL-17+IFN-\u03b3+ ones, and inflammatory monocytes into the spinal cord and (iii) subsequently impaired CD4+ T lymphocyte reactivation/survival and differentiation into highly pathogenic IL-17+ cells (reflecting downregulated expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-23/p19). On the other hand, when the neurological deficit reached maximum/plateau, in AO rat spinal cord was found lower CD4+FoxP3+CD25+ cell frequency followed by higher frequency of IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells, which most likely also belong to regulatory T lymphocytes. Thus, the altered relation between regulatory T cell and effector CD4+ T cell subsets was linked with persistence of mild neuroinflammation in AO rat EAE model."

                "abstract": "A growing body of evidence has shown that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency virus (AIDS). It is thought that two mechanisms are in charge of protection against MS, which include immunosuppression induced by chronic HIV infection (depletion of CD4\u202f+\u202fT cells) and antiretroviral medications. HIV-1 encodes several regulatory (Tat and Rev) and accessory (Vpr, Vif, Vpu, and Nef) proteins that have immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory properties. HIV-1 Tat protein is a strongly immunosuppressive agent and can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we examined the effect of HIV-1 Tat, which is classified into clade B and C, on inflammation, gliosis, apoptosis, and behavioral function in a murine model of MS called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). For this aim, mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55), followed by pertussis toxin to induce paralysis in EAE mice. After the induction of EAE in mice, the animals intraperitoneally received serial doses of HIV-1 Tat clade B and C (5, 10, and 20\u202f\u00b5g/kg body weight) when the early clinical manifestations of EAE were initiated. The results showed that the administration of both clades of the Tat protein led to a marked decrease in the clinical score of EAE mice, as well as improvement in motor-neuron functions. In line with this, Tat considerably reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the sacral region of the spinal cord through the upregulation expression of the Bcl-2 protein. Besides, proinflammatory cytokines such as, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-17 were significantly diminished in the serum and spinal cord of EAE mice receiving HIV-1 Tat clade B and C. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-4 were elevated in the serum and spinal cord of EAE mice receiving HIV Tat clade B and C when compared with the control group. The immunohistochemical analysis indicated that HIV-1 Tat clade B and C mitigated microgliosis and astrogliosis. The flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the number of Th1 and Th17cells was significantly decreased in response to TAT administration while the frequency of Th2 cells was markedly increased in the peripheral blood of mice with EAE without influencing the number of T regulatory cells (CD4\u202f+\u202fCD25\u202f+\u202fforkhead box protein 3\u202f+\u202f). It seems that HIV-1 Tat could be a bona fide therapeutic protein for the alleviation of MS since it has beneficial roles in the suppression of neuroinflammation in MS pathology."

            "abstract": "Cancer vaccines based on resected tumors from patients have gained great interest as an individualized cancer treatment strategy. However, eliciting a robust therapeutic effect with personalized vaccines remains a challenge because of the weak immunogenicity of autologous tumor antigens. Utilizing exogenous prokaryotic constituents that act as adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity is a promising strategy to overcome this limitation. However, nonspecific stimulation of the immune system may elicit an undesirable immunopathological state. To specifically trigger sufficient antitumor reactivity without notable adverse effects, we developed an antigen and adjuvant codelivery nanoparticle vaccine based on Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membranes (EMs) and tumor cell membranes (TMs) from resected autologous tumor tissue. Introduction of the EM into the hybrid membrane nanoparticle vaccines (HM-NPs) induced dendritic cell maturation, thus activating splenic T cells. HM-NPs showed efficacy in immunogenic CT26 colon and 4T1 breast tumor mouse models and also efficiently induced tumor regression in B16-F10 melanoma and EMT6 breast tumor mouse models. Furthermore, HM-NPs provoked a strong tumor-specific immune response, which not only extended postoperative animal survival but also conferred long-term protection (up to 3 months) against tumor rechallenge in a CT26 colon tumor mouse model. Specific depletion of different immune cell populations revealed that CD8+ T and NK cells were crucial to the vaccine-elicited tumor regression. Individualized autologous tumor antigen vaccines based on effective activation of the innate immune system by bacterial cytoplasmic membranes hold great potential for personalized treatment of postoperative patients with cancer."

However, it remains challenge to elicit immune activation due to the weak immunogenicity of autologous tumor antigens. Here, a hybrid membrane cancer vaccine is successfully constructed by membrane fusion to enhance adaptive immune response and amplify personalized immunotherapy, which formed a codelivery system for autologous tumor antigens and immune adjuvants. Briefly, the functional hybrid vesicles (HM-NPs) are formed by hybridizing ginseng-derived extracellular vesicles-like particles (G-EVLPs) with the membrane originated from the resected autologous tumors. The introduction of G-EVLPs can enhance the phagocytosis of autologous tumor antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) and facilitate DCs maturation through TLR4, ultimately activating tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). HM-NPs can indeed strengthen specific immune responses to suppress tumors recurrence and metastasis including subcutaneous tumors and orthotopic tumors. Furthermore, a long-term immune protection can be obtained after vaccinating with HM-NPs, and prolonging the survival of animals. Overall, this personalized hybrid autologous tumor vaccine based on G-EVLPs provides the possibility of mitigating tumor recurrence and metastasis after surgery while maintaining good biocompatibility."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dendritic cells (DC) can elicit potent immune responses to tumors through their capacity to efficiently process and present tumor-associated antigens. In a variety of animal tumor models, vaccines based on tumor lysate-pulsed DC (TP-DC) have been shown to effectively immunize against lethal tumor challenges as well as to treat established growing tumors at skin and organ sites. The antitumor effects elicited by TP-DC-based vaccines in vivo have been shown to be mediated by tumor-specific proliferative, cytotoxic, and cytokine-secreting host-derived T cells. Because of the critical involvement of T cells in the antitumor immune response, we have been investigating whether the systemic administration of recombinant interleukin (IL)-2 can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TP-DC-based tumor vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunization with TP-DC plus IL-2 administration was evaluated to determine if this combination could enhance protective immunity toward a weakly immunogenic sarcoma (MCA-207) and a poorly immunogenic subline (D5) of the B16 melanoma and mediate therapeutic rejection of established tumors in C57BL/6 (B6) mouse models. RESULTS: We have demonstrated in our murine models that the addition of IL-2 at relatively nontoxic doses can markedly augment the antitumor activity of TP-DC-based tumor vaccine therapies against both a weakly immunogenic sarcoma and a poorly immunogenic melanoma. Animals treated with the combination exhibited significantly greater protection from tumor-cell challenge, significantly greater regression of established tumors, and significantly longer mean survival time than with either TP-DC or IL-2 therapy alone. The mechanism operative in vivo appears to involve the enhancement of immune T-cell function. CONCLUSION: These preclinical studies demonstrate the potential of this novel treatment strategy and support the rationale for planned phase I/II clinical trials of TP-DC-based vaccines plus IL-2 in patients with advanced melanoma and colorectal cancer."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autologous tumor cell-based vaccines (ATVs) aim to prevent and treat tumor metastasis by activating patient-specific tumor antigens to induce immune memory. However, their clinical efficacy is limited. Mannan-BAM (MB), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), can coordinate an innate immune response that recognizes and eliminates mannan-BAM-labeled tumor cells. TLR agonists and anti-CD40 antibodies (TA) can enhance the immune response by activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to present tumor antigens to the adaptive immune system. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of rWTC-MBTA, an autologous whole tumor cell vaccine consisting of irradiated tumor cells (rWTC) pulsed with mannan-BAM, TLR agonists, and anti-CD40 antibody (MBTA), in preventing tumor metastasis in multiple animal models. METHODS: The efficacy of the rWTC-MBTA vaccine was evaluated in mice using breast (4T1) and melanoma (B16-F10) tumor models via subcutaneous and intravenous injection of tumor cells to induce metastasis. The vaccine's effect was also assessed in a postoperative breast tumor model (4T1) and tested in autologous and allogeneic syngeneic breast tumor models (4T1 and EMT6). Mechanistic investigations included immunohistochemistry, immunophenotyping analysis, ELISA, tumor-specific cytotoxicity testing, and T-cell depletion experiments. Biochemistry testing and histopathology of major tissues in vaccinated mice were also evaluated for potential systemic toxicity of the vaccine. RESULTS: The rWTC-MBTA vaccine effectively prevented metastasis and inhibited tumor growth in breast tumor and melanoma metastatic animal models. It also prevented tumor metastasis and prolonged survival in the postoperative breast tumor animal model. Cross-vaccination experiments revealed that the rWTC-MBTA vaccine prevented autologous tumor growth, but not allogeneic tumor growth. Mechanistic data demonstrated that the vaccine increased the percentage of antigen-presenting cells, induced effector and central memory cells, and enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. T-cells obtained from mice that were vaccinated displayed tumor-specific cytotoxicity, as shown by enhanced tumor cell killing in co-culture experiments, accompanied by increased levels of Granzyme B, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and CD107a in T-cells. T-cell depletion experiments showed that the vaccine's antitumor efficacy depended on T-cells, especially CD4+ T-cells. Biochemistry testing and histopathology of major tissues in vaccinated mice revealed negligible systemic toxicity of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: The rWTC-MBTA vaccine demonstrated efficacy in multiple animal models through T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and has potential as a therapeutic option for preventing and treating tumor metastasis with minimal systemic toxicity."

Thus, the activation and maturation of DCs is the prerequisite for efficient CD8+ T cell-based antitumor immune responses, which is considered as a primary and promising task for nanovaccine engineering. Herein, we introduce a versatile nanovaccine of liposomes-coated gold nanocages (Lipos-AuNCs) modified with DCs specific antibody aCD11c for targeted delivery of adjuvant MPLA and melanoma antigen peptide TRP2 to promote the activation and maturation of DCs, and enhance tumor specific T lymphocytes responses.

As for any new technology, there are still considerable challenges that need to be addressed. Here, we investigate the antitumor potential of a novel liposomal vaccine, M/CpG-ODN-TRP2-Lipo. METHODS: We developed a vaccination strategy by assembling the DC-targeting mannose and immune adjuvant CpG-ODN on the surface of liposomes, which were loaded with melanoma-specific TRP2180-188 peptide as liposomal vaccine. M/CpG-ODN-TRP2-Lipo treatment was used to intendedly induce activation of DCs and antitumor- specific immune response in vivo. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated in vitro that the prepared liposomal particles were efficiently taken up by DCs. This uptake led to an enhanced activation of DCs, as measured by the upregulation of MHC II, CD80, and CD86.

This therapy significantly reduced the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells, while simultaneously increasing the number of activated T cells, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and interferon-\u03b3-producing cells. At the same time, it was found to suppress tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, as well as up-regulate their apoptosis. Interestingly, MyD88-knockout mice had significantly shorter median survival times compared to wild-type mice following the administration of M/CpG-ODN-TRP2-Lipo. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the antitumor activities of the vaccine partially rely on the Myd88 signaling pathway. Interestingly, compared to whole tumor cell lysate-based vaccine, M/CpG-ODN-TRP2-Lipo, tumor specific antigen peptide-based vaccine, improved survival of tumor-bearing mice as well as enhanced their antitumor responses. All in all, we describe a novel vaccine formulation, M/CpG-ODN-TRP2-Lipo, with the aim of improving antitumor responses by alleviating the immunosuppressive environment in tumors."

A whole-tumor-cell vaccine with complete cancer cell antigens and all conformations elicits robust immune responses and is a promising method for the treatment of advanced malignant tumors. In this study, we used 5-azacitidine to stimulate B16-F10 melanoma cells to express toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 on the cell surface and then chemically linked SZU-106, a small-molecule TLR7 agonist, to the cell surface with a pegylated linker to produce a novel whole-tumor-cell vaccine, abbreviated as Aza-BFcell-106. The vaccine stimulated mouse splenic lymphocytes and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to secrete cytokines, promoted the maturation of dendritic cells and enhanced the capability of dendritic cells to present antigens. In a mouse model of melanoma, the vaccine effectively inhibited tumor growth, decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival. Further combination of the vaccine with a chemokine inhibitor, reparixin, significantly increased the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the tumor environment, while the antitumor effect was significantly enhanced. The whole-tumor-cell vaccine Aza-BFcell-106 induced immune-activating responses in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, indicating that this vaccine has great potential to treat advanced malignant tumors."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cancer vaccines are a promising therapeutic approach in cancer immunotherapy and can inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis by activating a sustained antitumor immunoprotective effect. However, the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines is severely weakened by the low immunogenicity of cancer antigens and the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor tissues. METHODS: Here, we report a novel hybrid membrane nanovaccine, composed of mesoporous silica nanoparticle as a delivery carrier, hybrid cell membranes obtained from dendritic cells and cancer cells, and R837 as an immune adjuvant (R837@HM-NPs). We investigated the anti-tumor, tumor recurrence and metastasis prevention abilities of R837@HM-NPs and their mechanisms of action through a series of in vivo and ex vivo experiments. RESULTS: R837@HM-NPs not only provide effective antigenic stimulation but are also a durable supply of the immune adjuvant R837. In addition, R837@HM-NPs promote antigen endocytosis into dendritic cells via various receptor-mediated pathways. Compared with HM-NPs or R837@HM-NPs, R837@HM-NPs in combination with an immune checkpoint blockade showed stronger antitumor immune responses in inhibiting tumor growth, thus eliminating established tumors, and rejecting re-challenged tumors by regulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment and immunological memory effect. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the hybrid membrane nanovaccine in combination with immune checkpoint blockade is a powerful strategy to enhance antitumor immunotherapy without concerns of systemic toxicity."

Cancer vaccines not only need to induce a robust tumor Ag-specific immune response but also need to overcome the tolerogenic and immunosuppressive microenvironments that exist within many solid cancers. ISCOMATRIX adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) is able to induce both tumor Ag-specific cellular and Ab responses to protect mice against tumor challenge, but this is insufficient to result in regression of established solid tumors. In the current study, we have used B16-OVA melanoma, Panc-OVA pancreatic, and TRAMP-C1 prostate cancer mouse tumor models to test therapeutic efficacy of ISCOMATRIX vaccines combined with other immune modulators. The coadministration of an ISCOMATRIX vaccine with the TLR3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, and TLR9 agonist, CpG, reduced tumor growth in all tumor models and the presence of ISCOMATRIX in the formulation was critical for the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. This vaccine combination induced a robust and multifunctional CD8(+) T cell response. Therapeutic protection required IFN-\u03b3 and CD8(+) T cells, whereas NK and CD4(+) T cells were found to be redundant. ISCOMATRIX vaccines combined with TLR3 and TLR9 agonists represent a promising cancer immunotherapy strategy. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The manipulation of dendritic cells (DCs) for cancer vaccination has not reached its full potential, despite the revolution in cancer immunotherapy. DCs are fundamental for CD8+ T cell activation, which relies on cross-presentation of exogenous antigen on MHC-I and can be fostered by immunogenic cancer cell death. Translational and clinical research has focused on in vitro-generated monocyte-derived DCs, while the vaccination efficacy of natural conventional type 1\u2009DCs (cDC1s), which are associated with improved anti-tumor immunity and specialize on antigen cross-presentation, remains unknown. METHODS: We isolated primary spleen mouse cDC1s and established a protocol for fast ex vivo activation and antigen-loading with lysates of tumor cells that underwent immunogenic cell death by UV irradiation. Natural tumor antigen-loaded cDC1s were transferred and their potential for induction of endogenous CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in vivo, cancer prevention and therapy were assessed in three grafted cancer models. Further, we tested the efficacy of natural cDC1 vaccination in combination and comparison with anti-PD-1 treatment in two \"wildtype\" tumor models not expressing exogenous antigens. RESULTS: Herein, we reveal that primary mouse cDC1s ex vivo loaded with dead tumor cell-derived antigen are activated and induce strong CD8+ T cell responses from the endogenous repertoire upon adoptive transfer in vivo through tumor antigen cross-presentation. Notably, cDC1-based vaccines enhance tumor infiltration by cancer-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and halt progression of engrafted cancer models, including tumors that are refractory to anti-PD-1 treatment. Moreover, combined tumor antigen-loaded primary cDC1 and anti-PD-1 therapy had strong synergistic effects in a PD-1 checkpoint inhibition susceptible cancer model. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical proof-of-principle study is first to support the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with syngeneic dead tumor cell antigen-loaded mouse cDC1s, the equivalents of the human dendritic cell subset that correlates with beneficial prognosis of cancer patients. Our data pave the way for translation of cDC1-based cancer treatments into the clinic when isolation of natural human cDC1s becomes feasible."

Currently, there is only one FDA approved vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer and as such prostate cancer continues to present a significant unmet medical need. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a therapeutic cancer vaccine that combines the ISCOMATRIX\u2122 adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) with the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and Flt3L, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand. We employed the TRAMP-C1 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) model of prostate cancer and the self-protein mPAP (prostatic acid phosphatase) as the tumor antigen. ISCOMATRIX\u2122-mPAP-Poly I:C-Flt3L was delivered in a therapeutic prime-boost regime that was consistently able to achieve complete tumor regression in 60% of animals treated and these tumor-free animals were protected upon rechallenge. Investigations into the underlying immunological mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of this vaccine identified that both innate and adaptive responses are elicited and required. NK cells, CD4+ T cells and interferon-\u03b3 were all found to be critical for tumor control while tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells became disabled by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. There is potential for broader application of this cancer vaccine, as we have been able to demonstrate effectiveness in two additional cancer models; melanoma (B16-OVA) and a model of B cell lymphoma (E\u00b5-myc-GFP-OVA)."

However, the poor immunogenicity of tumor antigens and suppression of the immune system in the tumor microenvironment are two major obstacles for developing effective cancer vaccines. Invariant NKT cells (iNKT cells), which are essential bridges between the innate and adaptive immune systems, can be rapidly activated by their agonists and, consequently, evoke whole immune systems. Herein, we conjugated a potent agonist of the iNKT cell, \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), with the tumor-associated MUC1 glycopeptide antigens as novel self-adjuvanting cancer vaccines through click chemistry. Immunological studies revealed that the mouse immune system was potently evoked and that high levels of tumor-specific IgG antibodies were elicited by vaccine conjugates without an external adjuvant. The produced antibodies could specifically recognize and bind to antigen-expressing cancer cells and, subsequently, induce cytotoxicity through complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Thus, the insertion of \u03b1-GalCer significantly improved the immunogenicity of the MUC1 glycopeptide and induced strong antigen-specific antitumor responses, indicating that \u03b1-GalCer is an effective built-in adjuvant for constructing potent chemical synthetic antitumor vaccines."

                "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most powerful of all antigen-presenting cells and play a critical role in the induction of primary immune responses. DC-based vaccination represents a potentially powerful strategy for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, a new approach for a DC-based melanoma vaccine was described. Splenic DCs from C57BL/6 mice were fused with B16 melanoma cells, and the resultant B16/DC hybrid cells expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules - B7 as well as the B16 tumour marker M562 - which were enriched by Ia-mediated positive selection with a MiniMACS column. The fusion rates were 12.7-26.8%. To generate hybrid tumour vaccines with potentially greater potent therapeutic efficacy, we genetically engineered DCs with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) prior to cell fusion. Recombinant adenovirus vector was used to mediate gene transfer into DCs with high efficiency and DCs expressed GM-CSF at 96-138 ng/105 cells/ml 24 hr after GM-CSF gene transfer. GM-CSF gene-modified DCs (DC.GM) exhibited higher expression of B7 and co-stimulatory capacity in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Fusion of DC.GM with B16 cells generated B16/DC.GM hybrid cells secreting GM-CSF at 59-63 ng/105 cells/ml. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with the B16/DC hybrid vaccine elicited a specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response and protected the immunized mice from B16 tumour challenge, reduced pulmonary metastases and extended the survival of B16 tumour-bearing mice. The B16/DC.GM hybrid vaccine was able to induce a CTL response and protective immunity more potently and tended to be therapeutically more efficacious than the B16/DC vaccine. In vivo depletion of T-cell subsets demonstrated that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were essential for the therapeutic effects of B16/DC and B16/DC.GM hybrid vaccines. Additionally, other non-specific effector cells may also contribute to tumour rejection induced by the B16/DC.GM hybrid vaccine. These data indicate that a DC-based hybrid tumour vaccine may be an attractive strategy for cancer immunotherapy, and that GM-CSF gene-modified DCs may lead to the generation of hybrid vaccines with potentially increased therapeutic efficacy."

                "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination represents a promising approach to harness the specificity and potency of the immune system to combat cancer. Finding optimal strategies for tumor Ag preparation and subsequent pulsing of DC, as well as improving the immunogenicity of weak tumor Ags remain among the first challenges of this approach. In this report, we use a prophylactic vaccine consisting of DC loaded with whole, nonmanipulated B16-F10 melanoma cells that had been stressed by heat shock and gamma irradiation. Stressed B16-F10 cells underwent apoptosis and were internalized by bone marrow-derived DC during coculture. Surprisingly, coculture of DC with stressed B16-F10 undergoing apoptosis and necrosis did not induce DC maturation. However, a marked retardation in tumor growth was observed in C57BL/6 mice immunized using DC loaded with stressed B16-F10 cells and subsequently challenged with B16-F10 cells. Growth retardation was further increased by treating DC with LPS before in vivo administration. In vivo depletion studies revealed that both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells played a critical role in retarding tumor growth. In addition, treatment with anti-CD25 Ab to deplete CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells before DC vaccination considerably improved the effect of the vaccine and allowed the development of long-lived immune responses that were tumor protective. Our results demonstrate that depletion of regulatory T cells is an effective approach to improving the success of DC-based vaccination against weakly immunogenic tumors. Such a strategy can be readily applied to other tumor models and extended to therapeutic vaccination settings."

In this study, we aimed to develop a self-contained vaccine capable of directly stimulating anticancer CD8(+) T-cell immune responses. To achieve this, three whole-cell melanoma vaccines were developed expressing 4-1BBL or B7.1 T-cell co-stimulatory molecules individually or in combination. The ability of engineered vaccine cell lines to stimulate potent anticancer immune responses in C57BL/6 mice was assessed. Mice vaccinated with cells overexpressing both 4-1BBL and B7.1 (B16-F10-4-1BBL-B7.1-IFN\u03b3/\u03b2 anticancer vaccine) displayed the greatest increases in CD8(+) T-cell populations (1.9-fold increase versus control within spleens), which were efficiently activated following antigenic stimulation, resulting in a 10.7-fold increase in cancer cell cytotoxicity relative to control. The enhanced immune responses in B16-F10-4-1BBL-B7.1-IFN\u03b3/\u03b2-vaccinated mice translated into highly efficient rejection of live tumour burdens and conferred long-term protection against repeated tumour challenges, which were likely due to enhanced effector memory T-cell populations. Similar results were observed when dendritic cell (DC)-deficient LT\u03b1(-/-) mice were treated with the B16-F10-4-1BBL-B7.1-IFN\u03b3/\u03b2 anticancer vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine can directly stimulate CD8(+) T-cell responses in the context of severely reduced DCs. This study shows that the B16-F10-4-1BBL-B7.1-IFN\u03b3/\u03b2 anticancer vaccine acted as a highly effective antigen-presenting cell and is likely to be able to directly stimulate CD8(+) T-cells, without requiring co-stimulatory signals from either CD4(+) T-cells or DCs, and warrants translation of this technology into the clinical setting.

To enhance the immunogenicity of GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell vaccines, a novel approach expressing GM-CSF as a membrane-bound form (mbGM-CSF) on the tumor cell surface was investigated. The intent was to enhance antigen presentation by increasing interactions between the tumor cell lines in the vaccine and GM-CSF receptor positive antigen presenting cells (APC), notably the patient's Langerhans cells residing within the intradermal injection site. B16.F10 cells engineered to express either membrane-bound or secreted GM-CSF were compared in the B16.F10 mouse melanoma model. We observed that mbGM-CSF on the tumor cell surface retarded growth and induced protective immunity to subsequent wild-type tumor challenge more effectively than tumor cells secreting GM-CSF. Vaccination with irradiated mbGM-CSF B16.F10 also provided strong protection from wild-type tumor challenge, improved therapeutic effects against established tumors, and retarded lung metastases. These results demonstrate that mbGM-CSF B16.F10 cells can induce strong systemic immunity that protects against and therapeutically treats B16.F10 melanoma more effectively than analogous vaccines containing only secreted GM-CSF. These data warrant further development and clinical testing of mbGM-CSF tumor cell vaccines."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although metastasis is ultimately responsible for about 90% of breast cancer mortality, the vast majority of breast-cancer-related deaths are due to progressive recurrences from non-metastatic disease. Current adjuvant therapies are unable to prevent progressive recurrences for a significant fraction of patients with breast cancer. Autologous tumor cell vaccines (ATCVs) are a safe and potentially useful strategy to prevent breast cancer recurrence, in a personalized and patient-specific manner, following standard-of-care tumor resection. Given the high intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity in breast cancer, it is important to understand which factors influence the immunogenicity of breast tumor cells in order to maximize ATCV effectiveness. METHODS: The relative immunogenicity of two murine breast carcinomas, 4T1 and EMT6, were compared in a prophylactic vaccination-tumor challenge model. Differences in cell surface expression of antigen-presentation-related and costimulatory molecules were compared along with immunosuppressive cytokine production. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to modulate tumor-derived cytokine secretion. The impacts of cytokine deletion on splenomegaly, myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and ATCV immunogenicity were assessed. RESULTS: Mice vaccinated with an EMT6 vaccine exhibited significantly greater protective immunity than mice vaccinated with a 4T1 vaccine. Hybrid vaccination studies revealed that the 4T1 vaccination induced both local and systemic immune impairments. Although there were significant differences between EMT6 and 4T1 in the expression of costimulatory molecules, major disparities in the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines likely accounts for differences in immunogenicity between the cell lines. Ablation of one cytokine in particular, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), reversed MDSC accumulation and splenomegaly in the 4T1 model. Furthermore, G-CSF inhibition enhanced the immunogenicity of a 4T1-based vaccine to the extent that all vaccinated mice developed complete protective immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer cells that express high levels of G-CSF have the potential to diminish or abrogate the efficacy of breast cancer ATCVs. Fortunately, this study demonstrates that genetic ablation of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as G-CSF, can enhance the immunogenicity of breast cancer cell-based vaccines. Strategies that combine inhibition of immunosuppressive factors with immune stimulatory co-formulations already under development may help ATCVs reach their full potential."

However, the preparation of GM-CSF-transduced autologous tumor vaccines is time-consuming and technically challenging. In addition, the host antigen presenting cells, rather than the tumor vaccine cells themselves, present tumor-specific antigens and prime the host T cells. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of antigen-specific allogeneic tumor vaccines. We used human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) E7 protein as a model tumor antigen, which is associated with the development of most cervical carcinoma. B16, a C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) derived melanoma cell line, was genetically engineered to produce GM-CSF alone (B16GM), HPV-16 E7 alone (B16E7), or both (B16GME7). These vaccine cells were injected into BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice (10(6) cells/mouse). Two weeks later, mice were challenged with 10(5) live HPV-16 E7(+) BL-1 (H-2(d)) tumor cells and monitored for tumor progression twice weekly. To determine the effective cell population in the antitumor immunity elicited by B16GME7, we carried out in vivo antibody depletion experiments using CD4 and CD8 specific antibodies. In addition, as a measure of the immune responses produced by B16GME7, we performed an in vitro cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay using a standard chromium release method. We found that all of the mice vaccinated with B16GME7 remained tumor free 49 days post-BL-1 challenge. In contrast, mice vaccinated with B16GM and B16E7 did not show any tumor protection against a similar dose of BL-1 cells. Furthermore, the antitumor immunity produced by B16GME7 was dependent on both CD4 and CD8 T cells. In addition, E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity could be readily demonstrated in mice immunized with B16GME7. These results suggest that allogeneic tumor cells transduced with GM-CSF and the tumor antigen, HPV-16 E7, cannot only generate an E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes response in vitro, but can also elicit a potent antitumor immune response against an E7 expressing tumor in vivo."

However, existing strategies utilizing RNA or long peptides for the neoantigen vaccines render limited immune responses since only 20-30% of neoantigens predicted in silico to bind MHC I molecules are capable of eliciting immune responses with the majority of responding T cells are CD4+. Therefore, it warrants further exploration to enhance neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells responses. Since neoantigens are naturally weak antigens, we asked whether foreign T help epitopes could enhance their immunogenicity. In present study, we chose 4 weak B16F10 neoantigens as vaccine targets, and fused them to the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, namely DTT-neoAg. Strikingly, the vaccine elicited anti-tumor CD8+ T cells responses and enhanced tumor infiltration of both T cells and NK cells. Impressively, DTT-neoAg vaccine significantly deterred tumor growth with the inhibition rate reached 88% in the preventive model and 100% in the therapeutic model at low dose of tumor challenge. Furthermore, after second challenge with higher dose of tumor cells, 33.3% of the immunized mice remained tumor-free for 6 months in the therapeutic model. Because DTT is a non-toxic domain of diphtheria toxin, it may be not of great concern in terms of safety as a Th epitope provider. Thus, the fusion strategy employed by this study may become a feasible and powerful approach for development of personalized cancer vaccines."

            "abstract": "Limited experimental evidence bridges nutrition and cancer immunosurveillance. Here, we show that ketogenic diet (KD) - or its principal ketone body, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), most specifically in intermittent scheduling - induced T cell-dependent tumor growth retardation of aggressive tumor models. In conditions in which anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 failed to reduce tumor growth in mice receiving a standard diet, KD, or oral supplementation of 3HB reestablished therapeutic responses. Supplementation of KD with sucrose (which breaks ketogenesis, abolishing 3HB production) or with a pharmacological antagonist of the 3HB receptor GPR109A abolished the antitumor effects. Mechanistically, 3HB prevented the immune checkpoint blockade-linked upregulation of PD-L1 on myeloid cells, while favoring the expansion of CXCR3+ T cells. KD induced compositional changes of the gut microbiota, with distinct species such as Eisenbergiella massiliensis commonly emerging in mice and humans subjected to carbohydrate-low diet interventions and highly correlating with serum concentrations of 3HB. Altogether, these results demonstrate that KD induces a 3HB-mediated antineoplastic effect that relies on T cell-mediated cancer immunosurveillance."

However, how DR limits cancer progression remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that feeding mice a low-protein (Low PROT) isocaloric diet but not a low-carbohydrate (Low CHO) diet reduced tumor growth in three independent mouse cancer models. Surprisingly, this effect relies on anticancer immunosurveillance, as depleting CD8+ T\u00a0cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or using immunodeficient mice prevented the beneficial effect of the diet. Mechanistically, we established that a Low PROT diet induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in tumor cells through the activation of IRE1\u03b1 and RIG1 signaling, thereby resulting in cytokine production and mounting an efficient anticancer immune response. Collectively, our data suggest that a Low PROT diet induces an IRE1\u03b1-dependent UPR in cancer cells, enhancing a CD8-mediated T\u00a0cell response against tumors."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Even in the presence of oxygen, malignant cells often highly depend on glycolysis for energy generation, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. One strategy targeting this metabolic phenotype is glucose restriction by administration of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet. Under these conditions, ketone bodies are generated serving as an important energy source at least for non-transformed cells. METHODS: To investigate whether a ketogenic diet might selectively impair energy metabolism in tumor cells, we characterized in vitro effects of the principle ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate in rat hippocampal neurons and five glioma cell lines. In vivo, a non-calorie-restricted ketogenic diet was examined in an orthotopic xenograft glioma mouse model. RESULTS: The ketone body metabolizing enzymes 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (BDH1 and 2), 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase 1 (OXCT1) and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) were expressed at the mRNA and protein level in all glioma cell lines. However, no activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway was observed in glioma cells, consistent with the absence of substantial 3-hydroxybutyrate metabolism and subsequent accumulation of succinate. Further, 3-hydroxybutyrate rescued hippocampal neurons from glucose withdrawal-induced cell death but did not protect glioma cell lines. In hypoxia, mRNA expression of OXCT1, ACAT1, BDH1 and 2 was downregulated. In vivo, the ketogenic diet led to a robust increase of blood 3-hydroxybutyrate, but did not alter blood glucose levels or improve survival. CONCLUSION: In summary, glioma cells are incapable of compensating for glucose restriction by metabolizing ketone bodies in vitro, suggesting a potential disadvantage of tumor cells compared to normal cells under a carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diet. Further investigations are necessary to identify co-treatment modalities, e.g. glycolysis inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents that efficiently target non-oxidative pathways."

In experimental models and clinical trials, the KD has shown anti-tumor effects, possibly by reducing energy supplies to cells, which damage the tumor microenvironment and inhibit tumor growth. Here, we determined expression levels of genes encoding the ketolytic enzymes 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) and succinyl-CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1 (OXCT1) in 33 human cancer cell lines. We then selected two representative lines, HeLa and PANC-1, for in vivo examination of KD sensitivity in tumors with high or low expression, respectively, of these two enzymes. In mice with HeLa xenografts, the KD increased tumor growth and mouse survival decreased, possibly because these tumors actively consumed ketone bodies as an energy source. Conversely, the KD significantly inhibited growth of PANC-1 xenograft tumors. \u03b2HB added to each cell culture significantly increased proliferation of HeLa cells, but not PANCI-1 cells. Downregulation of both BDH1 and OXCT1 rendered HeLa cells sensitive to the KD in vitro and in vivo. Tumors with low ketolytic enzyme expression may be unable to metabolize ketone bodies, thus predicting a better response to KD therapy."

                "abstract": "Recombinant human IL2 is being considered as a combination partner for immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy, but the product only has a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, we used F8-IL2, an antibody-IL2 fusion protein capable of selective localization to the tumor site, in combination with antibodies against murine CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1. In immunocompetent mice bearing CT26 tumors, the combination of F8-IL2 with CTLA-4 blockade was efficacious, leading to increased progression-free survival and protective immunity against subsequent tumor rechallenges. The combination with anti-PD-1 induced substantial tumor growth retardation, but tumor clearance was rare, whereas the combination with anti-PD-L1 exhibited the lowest activity. A detailed high-parametric single-cell analysis of the tumor leukocyte composition revealed that F8-IL2 had a strong impact on NK-cell activity without collateral immune activation in the systemic immune compartment, whereas CTLA-4 blockade led to significant changes in the T-cell compartment. Leukocyte depletion studies revealed that CD8+ T and NK cells were the main drivers of the therapeutic activity. We extended the experimental observations to a second model, treating MC38 tumor-bearing mice with F8-IL2 and/or CTLA-4 blockade. Only the combination treatment displayed potent anticancer activity, characterized by an increase in cytolytic CD8+ T and NK cells in tumors and draining lymph nodes. A decrease in the regulatory T cell frequency, within the tumors, was also observed. The results provide a rationale for the combined use of engineered IL2 therapeutics with immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer therapy."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The US is experiencing an epidemic of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), the rates and burden of which now exceed that for cervical cancer. Immunotherapy targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and/or its ligand PD-L1 on tumor cells, which was effective in several cancers has however, showed efficacy in only less than 15% of patients. METHODS: We used a preclinical HPV+ oral tumor model, mEER, consisting of mouse tonsil derived epithelial cells expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes, along with the H-ras oncogene to test strategies for enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: Monotherapy with PD-1 blocking antibody was ineffective against flank-implanted tumors, but induced regression in 54% of mice bearing orthotopic tongue tumors that correlated with higher CD8 T cell responses. Since the CD8+ T cells derived from tongue tumors also showed high levels of the immune checkpoint inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, we tested combination immunotherapy targeting both CTLA-4 and PD-1 together and observed 93.3% survival of mice bearing tumors in the tongue for the duration of our 100-day study. Protective immunity correlated with a significant decrease in immunosuppressive lymphoid and myeloid populations within the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with the reported capacity of interferon-driven PD-L1/PD-1 pathway induction to serve as a biomarker of response to PD-1 blockade, we observed elevated interferon signaling and significantly higher levels of PD-1/PD-L1 in tongue-implanted mEER tumors compared to those growing on the flank correlating with their preferential responsiveness to PD-1 blockade. More importantly, in a pseudometastasic mouse model bearing both flank and tongue tumors to represent metastatic disease, delivery of Stimulator of Interferon Induced Genes (STING) agonist into the flank tumors combined with systemic treatment with \u03b1-PD-1 and \u03b1-CTLA-4 antibodies resulted in sustained tumor regression in 71% of mice. In this case, productive abscopal anti-tumor immunity was associated with robust increases in the ratios of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTL) versus regulatory T cells (Treg) and versus functional myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). CONCLUSIONS: These results support combining \u03b1-PD-1 therapy with induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling via provision of STING agonist and/or through CTLA-4 blockade as potential treatment option for HNSCC patients, especially, those not responding to \u03b1-PD-1 monotherapy."

                "abstract": "Aberrant energy status contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that ketogenic-diet-induced changes in energy status enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy by decreasing PD-L1 protein levels and increasing expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and antigen presentation genes. Mechanistically, energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn, phosphorylates PD-L1 on Ser283, thereby disrupting its interaction with CMTM4 and subsequently triggering PD-L1 degradation. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which disrupts PRC2 function, leading to enhanced IFNs and antigen presentation gene expression. Through these mechanisms, AMPK agonists or ketogenic diets enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy and improve the overall survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for AMPK in regulating the immune response to immune-checkpoint blockade and advocate for combining ketogenic diets or AMPK agonists with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy to combat cancer."

                "abstract": "Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is an enzyme that degrades tryptophan into kynurenine and thereby induces immunosuppression. Like indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), TDO is considered as a relevant drug target to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. However, its role in various immunotherapy settings has not been fully characterized. Here, we described a new small-molecule inhibitor of TDO that can modulate kynurenine and tryptophan in plasma, liver, and tumor tissue upon oral administration. We showed that this compound improved the ability of anti-CTLA4 to induce rejection of CT26 tumors expressing TDO. To better characterize TDO as a therapeutic target, we used TDO-KO mice and found that anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 induced rejection of MC38 tumors in TDO-KO, but not in wild-type mice. As MC38 tumors did not express TDO, we related this result to the high systemic tryptophan levels in TDO-KO mice, which lack the hepatic TDO needed to contain blood tryptophan. The antitumor effectiveness of anti-PD1 was abolished in TDO-KO mice fed on a tryptophan-low diet that normalized their blood tryptophan level. MC38 tumors expressed IDO1, which could have limited the efficacy of anti-PD1 in wild-type mice and could have been overcome in TDO-KO mice due to the high levels of tryptophan. Accordingly, treatment of mice with an IDO1 inhibitor improved the efficacy of anti-PD1 in wild-type, but not in TDO-KO, mice. These results support the clinical development of TDO inhibitors to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy of TDO-expressing tumors and suggest their effectiveness even in the absence of tumoral TDO expression.See article by Hoffmann et al., p. 19."

                "abstract": "D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (D-3HB), a monomer of microbial polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), is also a natural ketone body produced during carbohydrate deprivation to provide energy to the body cells, heart, and brain. In recent years, increasing evidence demonstrates that D-3HB can induce pleiotropic effects on the human body which are highly beneficial for improving physical and metabolic health. Conventional ketogenic diet (KD) or exogenous ketone salts (KS) and esters (KE) have been used to increase serum D-3HB level. However, strict adaptation to the KD was often associated with poor patient compliance, while the ingestion of KS caused gastrointestinal distresses due to excessive consumption of minerals. As for ingestion of KE, subsequent degradation is required before releasing D-3HB for absorption, making these methods somewhat inferior. This review provides novel insights into a biologically synthesized D-3HB (D-3-hydroxybutyric acid) which can induce a faster increase in plasma D-3HB compared to the use of KD, KS, or KE. It also emphasizes on the most recent applications of D-3HB in different fields, including its use in improving exercise performance and in treating metabolic or age-related diseases. Ketones may become a fourth micro-nutrient that is necessary to the human body along with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Indeed, D-3HB being a small molecule with multiple signaling pathways within the body exhibits paramount importance in mitigating metabolic and age-related diseases. Nevertheless, specific dose-response relationships and safety margins of using D-3HB remain to be elucidated with more research. KEY POINTS: \u2022 D-3HB induces pleiotropic effects on physical and metabolic health. \u2022 Exogenous ketone supplements are more effective than ketogenic diet. \u2022 d-3HB as a ketone supplement has long-term healthy impact."

                "abstract": "Ketogenesis takes place in hepatocyte mitochondria where acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid catabolism is converted to ketone bodies (KB), namely \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-OHB), acetoacetate and acetone. KB represent important alternative energy sources under metabolic stress conditions. Ketogenic diets (KDs) are low-carbohydrate, fat-rich eating strategies which have been widely proposed as valid nutritional interventions in several metabolic disorders due to its substantial efficacy in weight loss achievement. Carbohydrate restriction during KD forces the use of FFA, which are subsequently transformed into KB in hepatocytes to provide energy, leading to a significant increase in ketone levels known as \"nutritional ketosis\". The recent discovery of KB as ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) - cellular transducers implicated in a wide range of body functions - has aroused a great interest in understanding whether some of the clinical effects associated to KD consumption might be mediated by the ketone/GPCR axis. Specifically, anti-inflammatory effects associated to KD regimen are presumably due to GPR109A-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by \u03b2-OHB, whilst lipid profile amelioration by KDs could be ascribed to the actions of acetoacetate via GPR43 and of \u03b2-OHB via GPR109A on lipolysis. Thus, this review will focus on the effects of KD-induced nutritional ketosis potentially mediated by specific GPCRs in metabolic and endocrinological disorders. To discriminate the effects of ketone bodies per se, independently of weight loss, only studies comparing ketogenic vs isocaloric non-ketogenic diets will be considered as well as short-term tolerability and safety of KDs."

                "abstract": "One of the proposed nutritional therapies to support drug therapy in COVID-19 is the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) or ketone bodies. In this review, we summarized the evidence from tissue, animal, and human models and looked at the mechanisms of action of KD/ketone bodies against COVID-19. KD/ketone bodies were shown to be effective at the stage of virus entry into the host cell. The use of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), by preventing the metabolic reprogramming associated with COVID-19 infection and improving mitochondrial function, reduced glycolysis in CD4+ lymphocytes and improved respiratory chain function, and could provide an alternative carbon source for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Through multiple mechanisms, the use of KD/ketone bodies supported the host immune response. In animal models, KD resulted in protection against weight loss and hypoxemia, faster recovery, reduced lung injury, and resulted in better survival of young mice. In humans, KD increased survival, reduced the need for hospitalization for COVID-19, and showed a protective role against metabolic abnormalities after COVID-19. It appears that the use of KD and ketone bodies may be considered as a clinical nutritional intervention to assist in the treatment of COVID-19, despite the fact that numerous studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone may induce ketoacidosis. However, the use of such an intervention requires strong scientific validation."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by very limited dietary carbohydrate intake and used as nutritional treatment for GLUT1-deficiency syndromes and pharmacologically refractory epilepsy, may promote weight loss and improve metabolic fitness, potentially alleviating the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Here, we have studied the effects of administration of a ketogenic diet in mice previously rendered obese by feeding a high fat diet (HFD) and submitted to surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus to mimic osteoarthritis. METHODS: 6-weeks old mice were fed an HFD for 10 weeks and then switched to a chow diet (CD), KD or maintained on a HFD for 8 weeks. Glycemia, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), body weight and fat mass were compared among groups. In liver and kidney, protein expression and histone post-translational modifications were assessed by Western blot, and gene expression by quantitative Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: After a 10 weeks HDF feeding, administration for 8 weeks of a KD or CD induced a comparable weight loss and decrease in fat mass, with better glycemic normalization in the KD group. Histone \u03b2-hydroxybutyrylation, but not histone acetylation, was increased in the liver and kidney of mice fed the KD and the rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2 was upregulated - at the gene and protein level - in liver and, to an even greater extent, in kidney. KD-induced HMGCS2 overexpression may be dependent on FGF21, whose gene expression was increased by KD in liver. CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 8 weeks, KD is more effective than a chow diet to induce metabolic normalization. Besides acting as a fuel molecule, BHB may exert its metabolic effects through modulation of the epigenome - via histone \u03b2-hydroxybutyrylation - and extensive transcriptional modulation in liver and kidney."

Histamine dihydrochloride (HDC), a NOX2 inhibitor, exerts anti-cancer efficacy in experimental tumor models but the detailed mechanisms are insufficiently understood. To determine effects of HDC on the MDSC compartment we utilized three murine cancer models known to entail accumulation of MDSC, i.e. EL-4 lymphoma, MC-38 colorectal carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary carcinoma. In vivo treatment with HDC delayed EL-4 and 4T1 tumor growth and reduced the ROS formation by intratumoral MDSCs. HDC treatment of EL-4 bearing mice also reduced the accumulation of intratumoral MDSCs and reduced MDSC-induced suppression of T cells ex vivo. Experiments using GR1-depleted and Nox2 knock out mice supported that the anti-tumor efficacy of HDC required presence of NOX2+ GR1+ cells in vivo. In addition, treatment with HDC enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand checkpoint blockade in EL-4- and MC-38-bearing mice. Immunomodulatory effects of a HDC-containing regimen on MDSCs were further analyzed in a phase IV trial (Re:Mission Trial, ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01347996) where patients with acute myeloid leukemia received HDC in conjunction with low-dose IL-2 (HDC/IL-2) for relapse prevention. Peripheral CD14+HLA-DR-/low MDSCs (M-MDSCs) were reduced during cycles of HDC/IL-2 therapy and a pronounced reduction of M-MDSCs during HDC/IL-2 treatment heralded favorable clinical outcome. We propose that anti-tumor properties of HDC may comprise the targeting of MDSCs."

This contrasts with normal brain tissue that can derive energy from both glucose and ketone bodies. We examined for the first time the potential efficacy of dietary therapies that reduce plasma glucose and elevate ketone bodies in the CT-2A syngeneic malignant mouse astrocytoma. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a standard diet unrestricted (SD-UR), a ketogenic diet unrestricted (KD-UR), the SD restricted to 40% (SD-R), or the KD restricted to 40% of the control standard diet (KD-R). Body weights, tumour weights, plasma glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were measured 13 days after tumour implantation. CT-2A growth was rapid in both the SD-UR and KD-UR groups, but was significantly reduced in both the SD-R and KD-R groups by about 80%. The results indicate that plasma glucose predicts CT-2A growth and that growth is dependent more on the amount than on the origin of dietary calories. Also, restriction of either diet significantly reduced the plasma levels of IGF-1, a biomarker for angiogenesis and tumour progression. Owing to a dependence on plasma glucose, IGF-1 was also predictive of CT-2A growth. Ketone bodies are proposed to reduce stromal inflammatory activities, while providing normal brain cells with a nonglycolytic high-energy substrate. Our results in a mouse astrocytoma suggest that malignant brain tumours are potentially manageable with dietary therapies that reduce glucose and elevate ketone bodies."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated mouse cell lines harboring various status of PD-L1/PD-L2 and evaluated the tumor growth and phenotypes of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes using several PD-1 signal blockades in animal models. In humans, the correlation between immune-related gene expression and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) or PDCD1LG2 (encoding PD-L2) was investigated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. In addition, PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression in tumor cells and CD8+ T-cell infiltration were assessed by IHC. RESULTS: In animal models, we showed that PD-L2 expression alone or simultaneously expressed with PD-L1 in tumor cells significantly suppressed antitumor immune responses, such as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and was involved in the resistance to treatment with anti-PD-L1 mAb alone. This resistance was overcome by anti-PD-1 mAb or combined treatment with anti-PD-L2 mAb. In clinical settings, antitumor immune responses were significantly correlated with PD-L2 expression in the tumor microenvironment in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that PD-L2 as well as PD-L1 play important roles in evading antitumor immunity, suggesting that PD-1/PD-L2 blockade must be considered for optimal immunotherapy in PD-L2-expressing cancers, such as RCC and LUSC."

Recent evidence suggest that targeted blockade of multiple immunosuppressive pathways can induce synergistic antitumor responses. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we investigated whether targeted blockade of CD73, an ectonucleotidase that catabolizes the hydrolysis of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, can enhance the antitumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs against transplanted and chemically induced mouse tumors. RESULTS: Anti-CD73 mAb significantly enhanced the activity of both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs against MC38-OVA (colon) and RM-1 (prostate) subcutaneous tumors, and established metastatic 4T1.2 breast cancer. Anti-CD73 mAb also significantly enhanced the activity of anti-PD-1 mAb against 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced fibrosarcomas. Gene-targeted mice revealed that single-agent therapies and combinatorial treatments were dependent on host IFN-\u03b3 and CD8(+) T cells, but independent of perforin. Interestingly, anti-CD73 mAb preferentially synergized with anti-PD-1 mAb. We investigated the effect of extracellular adenosine on tumor-infiltrating T cells and showed that activation of A2A adenosine receptor enhances PD-1 expression, but not CTLA-4 expression, on tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and CD4+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study revealed that targeted blockade of CD73 can enhance the therapeutic activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs and may thus potentiate therapeutic strategies targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors in general."

                "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an incurable multisystem disease characterized by mTORC1-hyperactive tumors. TSC1/2 mutations also occur in other neoplastic disorders, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and bladder cancer. Whether TSC-associated tumors will respond to immunotherapy is unknown. We report here that the programmed death 1 coinhibitory receptor (PD-1) is upregulated on T cells in renal angiomyolipomas (AML) and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). In C57BL/6J mice injected with syngeneic TSC2-deficient cells, anti-PD-1 alone decreased 105K tumor growth by 67% (P < 0.0001); the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade was even more effective in suppressing tumor growth. Anti-PD-1 induced complete rejection of TSC2-deficient 105K tumors in 37% of mice (P < 0.05). Double blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 induced rejection in 62% of mice (P < 0.01). TSC2 reexpression in TSC2-deficient TMKOC cells enhanced antitumor immunity by increasing T cell infiltration and production of IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1 by T cells, suggesting that TSC2 and mTORC1 play specific roles in the induction of antitumor immunity. Finally, 1 month of anti-PD-1 blockade reduced renal tumor burden by 53% (P < 0.01) in genetically engineered Tsc2+/- mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that checkpoint blockade may have clinical efficacy for TSC and LAM, and possibly other benign tumor syndromes, potentially yielding complete and durable clinical responses."

                "abstract": "Immunotherapy is widely accepted as a powerful new treatment modality for the treatment of cancer. The most successful form of immunotherapy to date has been the blockade of the immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4. Combining inhibitors of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 increases the proportion of patients who respond to immunotherapy. However, most patients still do not respond to checkpoint inhibitors, and prognostic biomarkers are currently lacking. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism by which these checkpoint inhibitors enhance antitumor immune responses is required to more accurately predict which patients are likely to respond and further enhance this treatment modality. Our current study of two mouse tumor models revealed that CD4+Foxp3- cells activated by dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade modulated the myeloid compartment, including activation of conventional CD103+ dendritic cells (DC) and expansion of a myeloid subset that produces TNF\u03b1 and iNOS (TIP-DCs). CD4+Foxp3- T cell-mediated activation of CD103+ DCs resulted in enhanced IL12 production by these cells and IL12 enhanced the therapeutic effect of dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade. Given the importance of these myeloid subsets in the antitumor immune response, our data point to a previously underappreciated role of CD4+Foxp3- cells in modulating this arm of the antitumor immune response.

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB; anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4) correlate with the extent of tumor immune infiltrate, but the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of T cells following therapy are poorly characterized. A greater understanding of these processes may see the development of therapeutic interventions that enhance T-cell recruitment and, consequently, improved patient outcomes. We therefore investigated the chemokines essential for immune cell recruitment and subsequent therapeutic efficacy of these immunotherapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The chemokines upregulated by dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade were assessed using NanoString-based analysis with results confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry and cytometric bead array. Blocking/neutralizing antibodies confirmed the requirement for key chemokines/cytokines and immune effector cells. Results were confirmed in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors using single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and paired survival analyses. RESULTS: The CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were significantly upregulated following dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade and both CD8+ T-cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy were CXCR3 dependent. In both murine models and patients undergoing immunotherapy, macrophages were the predominant source of CXCL9 and their depletion abrogated CD8+ T-cell infiltration and the therapeutic efficacy of dual ICB. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of patient tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) revealed that CXCL9/10/11 was predominantly expressed by macrophages following ICB and we identified a distinct macrophage signature that was associated with positive responses to ICB. CONCLUSIONS: These data underline the fundamental importance of macrophage-derived CXCR3 ligands for the therapeutic efficacy of ICB and highlight the potential of manipulating this axis to enhance patient responses."

                "abstract": "Antipsychotic (AP) medications, such as olanzapine (OLZ), are used in the treatment of schizophrenia and a growing number of 'off-label' conditions. A single dose of OLZ causes robust increases in blood glucose within minutes of treatment. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether interventions that increase circulating ketone bodies (fasting, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2HB), ketone esters or a ketogenic diet (KD)) would be sufficient to protect against the acute metabolic side effects of OLZ. We demonstrate that fasting or the short-term consumption of a KD protects against OLZ-induced hyperglycaemia, independent of alterations in whole-body insulin action, and in parallel with a blunted rise in serum glucagon. Interestingly, the effects of fasting and KDs were not recapitulated by acutely increasing circulating concentrations of ketone bodies through treatment with \u03b2HB or oral ketone esters, approaches which increase ketone bodies to physiological or supra-physiological levels, respectively. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fasting and the short-term consumption of a KD can protect against acute AP-induced perturbations in glucose homeostasis, whereas manipulations which acutely increase circulating ketone bodies do not elicit the same beneficial effects. KEY POINTS: Antipsychotic medications cause rapid and robust increases in blood glucose. Co-treatment approaches to offset these harmful metabolic side effects have not been identified. We demonstrate that fasting or the consumption of a short-term ketogenic diet, but not treatment with \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate or oral ketone esters, protects against acute antipsychotic-induced hyperglycaemia. The protective effects of fasting and ketogenic diets were paralleled by reductions in serum glucagon, but not improvements in whole-body insulin action."

                "abstract": "Adenosine signaling through A2A receptors (A2AR) expressed on immune cells suppresses antitumor immunity. CPI-444 is a potent, selective, oral A2AR antagonist. Blockade of A2AR with CPI-444 restored T-cell signaling, IL2, and IFN\u03b3 production that were suppressed by adenosine analogues in vitro CPI-444 treatment led to dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. Concentrations of extracellular adenosine in the tumor microenvironment, measured using microdialysis, were approximately 100-150 nmol/L and were higher than corresponding subcutaneous tissue. Combining CPI-444 with anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 treatment eliminated tumors in up to 90% of treated mice, including restoration of immune responses in models that incompletely responded to anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy. Tumor growth was fully inhibited when mice with cleared tumors were later rechallenged, indicating that CPI-444 induced systemic antitumor immune memory. CD8+ T-cell depletion abrogated the efficacy of CPI-444 with and without anti-PD-L1 treatment, demonstrating a role for CD8+ T cells in mediating primary and secondary immune responses. The antitumor efficacy of CPI-444 with and without anti-PD-L1 was associated with increased T-cell activation, a compensatory increase in CD73 expression, and induction of a Th1 gene expression signature consistent with immune activation. These results suggest a broad role for adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in tumors and justify the further evaluation of CPI-444 as a therapeutic agent in patients with solid tumors.

            "abstract": "An mRNA with unmodified nucleosides induces type I interferons (IFN-I) through the stimulation of innate immune sensors. Whether IFN-I induced by mRNA vaccine is crucial for anti-tumor immune response remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and anti-tumor responses of mRNA encoding tumor antigens with different degrees of N1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03a8) modification in B16 melanoma model. Our results demonstrated that ovalbumin (OVA) encoding mRNA formulated in a lipid nanoparticle (OVA-LNP) induced substantial IFN-I production and the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) with negative correlation with increasing percentages of m1\u03a8 modification. In B16-OVA murine melanoma model, unmodified OVA-LNP significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival, compared to OVA-LNP with m1\u03a8 modification. This robust anti-tumor effect correlated with the increase in intratumoral CD40+ DCs and the frequency of granzyme B+/IFN-\u03b3+/TNF-\u03b1+ polyfunctional OVA peptide-specific CD8+ T cells. Blocking type I IFN receptor completely reversed the anti-tumor immunity of unmodified mRNA-OVA reflected in a significant decrease in OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells and enrichment of PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells. The robust anti-tumor effect of unmodified OVA-LNP was also observed in the lung metastatic tumor model. Finally, this mRNA vaccine was tested using B16 melanoma neoantigens (Pbk-Actn4) which resulted in delayed tumor growth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that an unmodified mRNA vaccine induces IFN-I production or the downstream signaling cascades which plays a crucial role in inducing robust anti-tumor T cell response for controlling tumor growth and metastasis."

                "abstract": "Messenger RNA encoding tumor antigens has the potential to evoke effective antitumor immunity. This study reports on a nanoparticle platform, named mRNA Galsomes, that successfully co-delivers nucleoside-modified antigen-encoding mRNA and the glycolipid antigen and immunopotentiator \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GC) to antigen-presenting cells after intravenous administration. By co-formulating low doses of \u03b1-GC, mRNA Galsomes induce a pluripotent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immune response in mice, with invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) as a driving force. In comparison, mRNA Galsomes exhibit advantages over the state-of-the-art cancer vaccines using unmodified ovalbumin (OVA)-encoding mRNA, as we observed up to seven times more tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, combined with a strong iNKT cell and NK cell activation. In addition, the presence of suppressive myeloid cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment was significantly lowered. Owing to these antitumor effects, OVA mRNA Galsomes significantly reduced tumor growth in established E.G7-OVA lymphoma, with a complete tumor rejection in 40% of the animals. Moreover, therapeutic vaccination with mRNA Galsomes enhanced the responsiveness to treatment with a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in B16-OVA melanoma, as evidenced by a synergistic reduction of tumor outgrowth and a significantly prolonged median survival. Taken together, these data show that intravenously administered mRNA Galsomes can provide controllable, multifaceted, and effective antitumor immunity, especially when combined with checkpoint inhibition."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The antigen HCA587 (also known as MAGE-C2), which is considered a cancer-testis antigen, exhibits upregulated expression in a wide range of malignant tumors with unique immunological properties, and may thus serve as a promising target for tumor immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the antitumor effect of the HCA587 protein vaccine and the response of humoral and cell-mediated immunity. METHODS: The HCA587 protein vaccine was formulated with adjuvants CpG and ISCOM. B16 melanoma cells were subcutaneously inoculated to C57BL/6 mice, followed by treatment with HCA587 protein vaccine subcutaneously. Mouse survival was monitored daily, and tumor volume was measured every 2 to 3 days. The tumor sizes, survival time and immune cells in tumor tissues were detected. And the vital immune cell subset and effector molecules were explored. RESULTS: After treatment with HCA587 protein vaccine, the vaccination elicited significant immune responses, which delayed tumor growth and improved animal survival. The vaccination increased the proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 and granzyme B in tumor tissues. The depletion of CD4+T cells resulted in an almost complete abrogation of the antitumor effect of the vaccination, suggesting that the antitumor efficacy was mediated by CD4+ T cells. In addition, knockout of IFN-\u03b3 resulted in a decrease in granzyme B levels, which were secreted by CD4+ T cells, and the antitumor effect was also significantly attenuated. CONCLUSION: The HCA587 protein vaccine may increase the levels of granzyme B expressed by CD4+ T cells, and this increase is dependent on IFN-\u03b3, and the vaccine resulted in a specific tumor immune response and subsequent eradication of the tumor."

                "abstract": "Vaccine immunotherapy must induce helper and cytotoxic cell-mediated immunity to generate the powerful antitumor immune responses needed to suppress cancer progression. We reported previously that a 16-amino acid peptide analogue derived from pigeon cytochrome c can bind broad ranges of MHC class II types and activate helper T cells in mice. To determine whether DNA encoding the Pan-MHC class II IA peptide (Pan-IA) can increase the efficacy of tumor suppression by DNA vaccine immunotherapy targeting tumor antigens, Pan-IA DNA was administered with ovalbumin (OVA) DNA to C57BL/6 mice bearing the OVA-expressing tumor cell line E.G7. Specific proliferative responses to and cytotoxic activities against OVA-expressing targets were induced in mice vaccinated with both OVA and Pan-IA DNA but not in those vaccinated with OVA DNA alone or control DNA plus Pan-IA DNA. Growth of E.G7 cells was suppressed only by combined vaccination with OVA and Pan-IA DNA, and tumors in five of the nine mice that received this combined vaccination were eradicated completely. In those mice, the frequency of CD8-positive T cells reactive with OVA(257-264) peptides in the context of H-2K(b) was significantly increased in the tumor site. Furthermore, immunofluorescent study of the inoculated tumors revealed increased accumulation of both CD4- and CD8-positive T cells producing IFN-gamma in the tumor only by this vaccine protocol. The data suggest that Pan-IA DNA can augment suppressive effects of DNA vaccines on tumor growth by increasing numbers of antigen-specific CTLs and helper T cells. This is the first study in which established tumors have been eradicated successfully by vaccination with DNA corresponding to CTL epitopes and helper T cell epitopes. Our animal model may contribute to the development of therapeutic DNA vaccines against cancer."

                "abstract": "Archaeosome adjuvants formulated as archaeal ether glycerolipid vesicles induce strong CD4(+) as well as CD8(+) CTL responses to entrapped soluble antigens. Immunization of mice with ovalbumin (OVA) entrapped in archaeosomes composed of the total polar lipids of Methanobrevibacter smithii resulted in a potent OVA-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, and subsequently, the mice dramatically resisted solid tumor growth of OVA-expressing EG.7 cells and lung metastasis of B16OVA melanoma cells. Prophylactic protection was antigen-specific because tumor curtailment was not seen in mice injected with antigen-free archaeosomes. Similarly, there was no protection against B16 melanoma cells lacking OVA expression. Furthermore, in vivo depletion of CD8(+) T cells abrogated the protective response, indicating that the antitumor immunity was mediated by CTLs. Depletion of CD4(+) T cells also resulted in partial loss of tumor protection, suggesting a beneficial role for T-helper cells. Interestingly OVA-archaeosomes induced enhanced CTL response in the absence of interleukin 12 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, interleukin 12-deficient mice mounted strong tumor protection. However, IFN-gamma-deficient mice, despite the strong CTL response, were only transiently protected, revealing a need for IFN-gamma response in tumor protection. Archaeosomes also facilitated therapeutic protection when injected into mice concurrent with tumor cells. Interestingly, even archaeosomes lacking entrapped antigen mediated therapeutic protection, and this correlated to the activation of innate immunity as evident by the increased tumor-infiltrating natural killer and dendritic cells. Thus, archaeosomes represent effective tumor antigen delivery vehicles that can mediate protection by activating both innate as well as acquired immunity."

                "abstract": "Background: The participation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in antigen presentation shapes both the breadth and magnitude of specific T cell response. Dendritic cells (DCs) activated with nucleic acid or protein that encodes/incorporates multiple antigenic epitopes elicit MHC class I- and II- biased immunity, respectively. Studies demonstrate that an elevated MHC class I-directed CD8+ cytotoxicity T lymphocyte (CTL) response is able to provide survival benefits to patient with malignant tumor. However, a fully effective cancer therapy must elicit a diverse repertoire of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, raising demands on a multifaceted activation of the MHC system. Current therapeutic strategies usually lack an orchestrated mobilization of the MHC class I and II responses. Vaccines with little synergistic effect or unmanageable elicitation of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity usually fail to induce a potent and durable anti-tumor protection. Methods: Here, cationic nanoemulsions (CNEs) complexed with full-length tumor model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in the form of mRNA or protein were constructed and used as two antigenic platforms to prepare DCs vaccines with tailored MHC participation (i.e., mRNA-DCs and protein-DCs). In exploring a vaccine regimen with optimal tumor suppressing effect, the mixing ratio of mRNA-DCs and protein-DCs was manipulated. Results: Therapeutic DCs vaccines involving both antigenic platforms induced better anti-tumor immunity in murine E.G7-OVA lymphoma model and B16-OVA melanoma model, which can be further augmented upon a meticulous reallocation of the MHC class I and II responses. Conclusion: This work indicated that a simultaneous and coordinated mobilization of the MHC-restricted immunity might potentiate cancer therapy."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are genetically engineered non-replicating viral vectors. Intratumoral administration of MVA induces a cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-mediated type I interferon (IFN) response and the production of high levels of the transgenes engineered into the viral genome such as tumor antigens to construct cancer vaccines. Although type I IFNs are essential for establishing CD8-mediated antitumor responses, this cytokine family may also give rise to immunosuppressive mechanisms. METHODS: In vitro assays were performed to evaluate the activity of simvastatin and atorvastatin on type I IFN signaling and on antigen presentation. Surface levels of IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1, endocytosis of bovine serum albumin-fluorescein 5 (6)-isothiocyanate, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) phosphorylation, and real-time PCR of IFN-stimulated genes were assessed in the murine fibroblast cell line L929. In vivo experiments were performed to characterize the effect of simvastatin on the MVA-induced innate immune response and on the antitumor effect of MVA-based antitumor vaccines in B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-OVA tumor models. RNAseq analysis, depleting monoclonal antibodies, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the MVA-mediated immune response. RESULTS: In this work, we identified commonly prescribed statins as potent IFN\u03b1 pharmacological inhibitors due to their ability to reduce surface expression levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1 and to reduce clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Simvastatin and atorvastatin efficiently abrogated for 8\u2009hours the transcriptomic response to IFN\u03b1 and enhanced the number of dendritic cells presenting an OVA-derived peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. In vivo, intraperitoneal or intramuscular administration of simvastatin reduced the inflammatory response mediated by peritumoral administration of MVA and enhanced the antitumor activity of MVA encoding tumor-associated antigens. The synergistic antitumor effects critically depend on CD8+ cells, whereas they were markedly improved by depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes, T regulatory cells, or NK cells. Either MVA-OVA alone or combined with simvastatin augmented B cells, CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes, and tumor-specific CD8+ in the tumor-draining lymph nodes. However, only the treatment combination increased the numbers of these lymphocyte populations in the tumor microenvironment and in the spleen. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, blockade of IFN\u03b1 functions by simvastatin markedly enhances lymphocyte infiltration and the antitumor activity of MVA, prompting a feasible drug repurposing."

                "abstract": "Anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy has been beneficial in treating patients with certain cancers. Here, we tested whether anti-PD-L1 therapy is effective for controlling different types of tumors using animal models of TC-1, MC38 and B16. We found that, despite PD-L1 expression, anti-PD-L1 therapy showed little and some antitumor activity in the TC-1 and MC38 models. However, anti-PD-L1 therapy exhibited a more dramatic antitumor effect in the B16 model. This difference in antitumor responses was likely associated with the CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell infiltration status of tumor tissues. In the B16 model, CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and to a lesser degree NK cells were found to be responsible for the antitumor response of anti-PD-L1 therapy, as determined by immune cell subset depletion. In particular, CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells from B16-bearing mice produced an IFN-\u03b3 in response to B16 cells and citrate phosphate buffer-treated B16 cell peptide elutes but not to an immunodominant class I epitope, Trp2180-188, suggesting that CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells that recognize neoantigens were induced in B16 tumor-bearing mice and then reactivated by anti-PD-L1 for tumor control. When B16 tumor-bearing mice were treated with anti-PD-L1 in combination with Trp2180-188 peptide vaccines, they displayed significantly more tumor control than either single therapy. Taken together, these studies show that B16 melanomas are more effectively controlled through reactivation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by anti-PD-L1 therapy. Moreover, combined therapy using anti-PD-L1 and Trp2 peptide vaccines is more beneficial for controlling B16 melanomas through reactivation of neoantigen-specific CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and induction of Trp2-specific CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells."

When a B16F10 melanoma cell lysate was used to load DCs with tumor antigens during exosome production together with poly(I:C), we obtained a Dexo vaccine capable of inducing robust activation of melanoma-specific CD8(+) T cells and the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, NK and NK-T cells to the tumor site, resulting in significantly reduced tumor growth and enhanced survival as compared to a Dexo vaccine formulation similar to the one previously tested on human patients. Our results indicate that poly(I:C) is a particularly favorable TLR agonist for DC maturation during antigen loading and exosome production for cancer immunotherapy. "

                "abstract": "Our previous study demonstrated that ascophyllan, a sulfated polysaccharide purified from brown alga, has immune-activating effects. In this study, we evaluated ascophyllan as an adjuvant for its therapeutic and preventive effect on tumor in a mouse melanoma model. Ascophyllan induced migration of DCs to spleen and tumor-draining lymph node (drLN) in a mouse B16 melanoma model. Moreover, ascophyllan induced activation of dendritic cells (DCs), and promoted IFN-\u03b3- and TNF-\u03b1-producing Th1 immune responses in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, treatment with a combination of ascophyllan and ovalbumin (OVA) in the tumor-bearing mice promoted proliferation of OVA-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and migration of those cells into the tumor, consequently inhibiting the tumor growth. Immunization with the combination of ascophyllan and OVA caused enhanced OVA-specific antibody production and memory T cell responses compared to OVA immunization alone, and almost completely prevented B16-OVA tumor growth upon subsequent tumor challenge. Finally, the combination of ascophyllan and OVA prevented B16-OVA tumor invasion and metastasis into the liver. Thus, these results demonstrate that ascophyllan can function as an adjuvant to induce DC activation, antigen specific CTL activation, Th1 immune response and antibody production, and hence may be useful as a therapeutic and preventive tumor vaccine.

                "abstract": "RNA vaccines based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with in vitro transcribed mRNA (IVT-mRNA) encapsulated are now a currently successful but still evolving modality of vaccines. One of the advantages of RNA vaccines is their ability to induce CD8+ T-cell-mediated cellular immunity that is indispensable for excluding pathogen-infected cells or cancer cells from the body. In this study, we report on the development of LNPs with an enhanced capability for inducing cellular immunity by using an ionizable lipid with a vitamin E scaffold. An RNA vaccine that contained this ionizable lipid and an IVT-mRNA encoding a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) induced OVA-specific cytotoxic T cell responses and showed an antitumor effect against an E.G7-OVA tumor model. Vaccination with the LNPs conferred protection against lethal infection by Toxoplasma gondii using its antigen TgPF. The vitamin E scaffold-dependent type I interferon response was important for effector CD8+ T cell differentiation induced by the mRNA-LNPs. Our findings also revealed that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were essential for achieving CD8+ T cell responses induced by the mRNA-LNPs, while the XCR1-positive subset of cDCs, cDC1 specialized for antigen cross-presentation, was not required. Consistently, the mRNA-LNPs were found to selectively transfect another subset of cDCs, cDC2 that had migrated from the skin to lymph nodes, where they could make vaccine-antigen-dependent contacts with CD8+ T cells. The findings indicate that the activation of innate immune signaling by the adjuvant activity of the vitamin E scaffold and the expression of antigens in cDC2 are important for subsequent antigen presentation and the establishment of antigen-specific immune responses."

We tested whether, by modulating the vaccination approaches and injection times, the anti-tumour activity could be enhanced. We used a B16-HBc melanoma murine model not only to compare the efficacy of DC vaccine immunized via footpads, intravenously or via intratumoral injections in treating melanoma and priming tumour-specific immune responses, but also to observe how DC vaccination could improve the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells to induce an enhanced anti-tumour immune response. Our results indicate that, although all vaccination approaches were able to protect mice from developing melanoma, only three intratumoral injections of DCs could induce a significant anti-tumour response. Furthermore, the combination of intratumoral DC vaccination and adoptive T cell transfer led to a more robust anti-tumour response than the use of each treatment individually by increasing CD8(+) T cells or the ratio of CD8(+) T cell/regulatory T cells in the tumour site. Moreover, the combination vaccination induced tumour-specific immune responses that led to tumour regression and protected surviving mice from tumour rechallenge, which is attributed to an increase in CD127-expressing and interferon-\u03b3-producing CD8(+) T cells. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated intratumoral DC vaccination not only induces expansion of antigen-specific T cells against tumour-associated antigens in tumour sites, but also leads to elimination of pre-established tumours, supporting this combined approach as a potent strategy for DC-based cancer immunotherapy."

Challenges for vaccine design are targeting Ag to dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo, facilitating cross-presentation, and conditioning the microenvironment for Th1 type immune responses. In this study, we report that ISCOM vaccines, which consist of ISCOMATRIX adjuvant and protein Ag, meet these challenges. Subcutaneous injection of an ISCOM vaccine in mice led to a substantial influx and activation of innate and adaptive immune effector cells in vaccine site-draining lymph nodes (VDLNs) as well as IFN-\u03b3 production by NK and NKT cells. Moreover, an ISCOM vaccine containing the model Ag OVA (OVA/ISCOM vaccine) was efficiently taken up by CD8\u03b1(+) DCs in VDLNs and induced their maturation and IL-12 production. Adoptive transfer of transgenic OT-I T cells revealed highly efficient cross-presentation of the OVA/ISCOM vaccine in vivo, whereas cross-presentation of soluble OVA was poor even at a 100-fold higher concentration. Cross-presenting activity was restricted to CD8\u03b1(+) DCs in VDLNs, whereas Langerin(+) DCs and CD8\u03b1(-) DCs were dispensable. Remarkably, compared with other adjuvant systems, the OVA/ISCOM vaccine induced a high frequency of OVA-specific CTLs capable of tumor cell killing in different tumor models. Thus, ISCOM vaccines combine potent immune activation with Ag delivery to CD8\u03b1(+) DCs in vivo for efficient induction of CTL responses."

In this study, we investigated whether exosomes loaded with \u03b1GC can activate iNKT cells and potentiate a cancer-specific adaptive immune response. \u03b1GC loaded exosomes readily activated iNKT cells both in vitro and in vivo. Exosomes loaded with \u03b1GC plus the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) induced potent NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell innate immune responses, and they also synergistically amplified T- and B-cell responses that were OVA specific. In contrast to soluble \u03b1GC, which anergizes iNKT cells, we found that \u03b1GC/OVA-loaded exosomes did not induce iNKT cell anergy but were more potent than soluble \u03b1GC + OVA in inducing adaptive immune responses. In an OVA-expressing mouse model of melanoma, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with \u03b1GC/OVA-loaded exosomes decreased tumor growth, increased antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration, and increased median survival, relative to control mice immunized with soluble \u03b1GC + OVA alone. Notably, an additional injection of \u03b1GC/OVA-loaded exosomes further augmented the treatment effects. Our findings show that exosomes loaded with protein antigen and \u03b1GC will activate adaptive immunity in the absence of triggering iNKT-cell anergy, supporting their application in the design of a broad variety of cancer immunotherapy trials."

This study was aimed at evaluating the polarization of T-cell responses using various DC Ag-priming strategies for vaccination purposes. DCs cocultured with irradiated \"apoptotic\" tumor cells, DC-tumor fusions, and DCs pulsed with freeze-thaw tumor lysate Ags served as Ag-primed DCs, with EG7 tumor cells (class II negative) expressing OVA as the model Ag. DCs loaded with class I- and class II-restricted OVA synthetic peptides served as controls. Primed DCs were assessed by the in vitro activation of B3Z OVA-specific CD8 T cells and the proliferation of OVA-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells from OT-I and OT-II TCR transgenic mice, respectively. In vivo responses were measured by tumor regression following treatment with Ag-primed DCs and by CTL assays. Quantification of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha by cytometric bead array (CBA) assay determined the polarization of TH1/TH2 responses, whereas H-2 Kb/SIINFEKL tetramers monitored the expansion of OVA-specific T cells. DC-EG7 hybrids stimulated both efficient class I and class II OVA responses, showing that DC-tumor hybrids are also capable of class II cross-presentation. The hybrids also induced the most potent CTLs, offered the highest protection against established EG7 tumors and also induced the highest stimulation of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production. DCs cocultured with irradiated EG7 were also effective at inducing OVA-specific responses, however with slightly reduced potency to those evoked by the hybrids. DCs loaded with lysates Ags were much less efficient at stimulating any of the OVA-specific T-cell responses, showed very little antitumor protection, and stimulated a weak TH1 response, overbalanced by an IL-5 TH2 response. The strategy of Ag-loading clearly influences the ability of DCs to polarize T cells for a TH1/TH2 response and thus determines the outcome of the elicited immune response, during various vaccination protocols."

However, DCs are a small population of cells, and their isolation and pulsing with antigen can be impractical. Here we show that a crude preparation of plasma membrane vesicles (PMV) from the highly metastatic murine melanoma (B16-OVA) and a surrogate tumor antigen (OVA) can be targeted directly to DCs in vivo to elicit functional effects. A novel metal-chelating lipid, 3(nitrilotriacetic acid)-ditetradecylamine, was incorporated into B16-OVA-derived PMV, allowing recombinant hexahistidine-tagged forms of single chain antibody fragments to the DC surface molecules CD11c and DEC-205, to be conveniently \"engrafted\" onto the vesicle surface by metal-chelating linkage. The modified PMV, or similarly engrafted synthetic stealth liposomes containing OVA or OVA peptide antigen, were found to target DCs in vitro and in vivo, in experiments using flow cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. When used as vaccines in syngeneic mice, the preparations stimulated strong B16-OVA-specific CTL responses in splenic T cells and a marked protection against tumor growth. Protection was dependent on the simultaneous delivery of both antigen and a DC maturation or \"danger signal\" signal (IFN-gamma or lipopolysaccharide). Administration of the DC-targeting vaccine to mice challenged with B16-OVA cells induced a dramatic immunotherapeutic effect and prolonged disease-free survival. The results show that the targeting of antigen to DCs in this way is highly effective at inducing immunity and protection against the tumor, with protection being at least partially dependent on the eosinophil chemokine eotaxin."

For mRNA vaccines, the targeted delivery to the lymph node (LN) is predicted to reduce side effects and increase the immune response. In this study, we explored an endogenously LN-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) without the modification of any active targeting ligands for developing an mRNA cancer vaccine. The LNP named 113-O12B showed increased and specific expression in the LN compared with LNP formulated with ALC-0315, a synthetic lipid used in the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. The targeted delivery of mRNA to the LN increased the CD8+ T cell response to the encoded full-length ovalbumin (OVA) model antigen. As a result, the protective and therapeutic effect of the OVA-encoding mRNA vaccine on the OVA-antigen-bearing B16F10 melanoma model was also improved. Moreover, 113-O12B encapsulated with TRP-2 peptide (TRP2180-188)-encoding mRNA also exhibited excellent tumor inhibition, with the complete response of 40% in the regular B16F10 tumor model when combined with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) therapy, revealing broad application of 113-O12B from protein to peptide antigens. All the treated mice showed long-term immune memory, hindering the occurrence of tumor metastatic nodules in the lung in the rechallenging experiments that followed. The enhanced antitumor efficacy of the LN-targeting LNP system shows great potential as a universal platform for the next generation of mRNA vaccines."

Agonistic anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) activate only cell-surface TLR4; in contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates both TLR4 and intracellular inflammatory caspases. In this study, we investigated the adjuvant activity of an anti-TLR4 mAb in T-cell-mediated antitumour immunity. The anti-TLR4 mAb induced the activation of antigen-specific T-cells in adoptive transfer studies. The growth of ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumours was significantly suppressed by administration of OVA and the anti-TLR4 mAb in combination, but not individually. The antitumour effect of anti-PD-1 mAb was enhanced in mice administered with OVA plus the anti-TLR4 mAb. The OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T-cells were induced by administration of OVA and the anti-TLR4 mAb. The suppression of tumour growth was diminished by depletion of CD8, but not CD4, T-cells. The inflammatory response to the anti-TLR4 mAb was of significantly lesser magnitude than that to LPS, as assessed by NF-\u03baB activation and production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Administration of LPS (at a dose that elicited levels of proinflammatory cytokines comparable to those by the anti-TLR4 mAb) plus OVA induced no or less-marked activation of OVA-specific T-cells and failed to suppress tumour growth in mice. In conclusion, the agonistic anti-TLR4 mAb induces potent CD8 T-cell-dependent antitumour immunity and an inflammatory response of lesser magnitude than does LPS. The agonistic anti-TLR4 mAb has potential as an adjuvant for use in vaccines against cancer."

Although the addition of 600 rad of total body irradiation delayed tumor growth, further adoptive transfer of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells was needed to achieve tumor regression and long-term survival of the treated mice. Lymphopenic mice treated with anti-PD-L1 Ab demonstrated increased activation and persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, including a higher number of CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the tumor mass.

To enhance DC targeting and vaccine efficiency, we included imiquimod (IMQ), a toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR 7/8) agonist, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a TLR4 agonist, to synthesize lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles using PCL-PEG-PCL and DOTAP (IMNPs) as well as DSPE-PEG-mannose (MAN-IMNPS). The spatiotemporal delivery of MPLA (within the outer lipid layer) to extracellular TLR4 and IMQ (in the hydrophobic core of NPs) to intracellular TLR7/8 can activate DCs synergistically to improve vaccine efficacy. Ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen was readily absorbed by positively charged DOTAP and showed a quick release in vitro. Our results demonstrated that this novel nanovaccine enhanced cellular uptake, cytokine production, and maturation of DCs. Compared with the quick metabolism of free OVA-agonists, the depot effect of OVA-IMNPs was observed, whereas MAN-OVA-IMNPs promoted trafficking to secondary lymphoid organs. After immunization with a subcutaneous injection, the nanovaccine, especially MAN-OVA-IMNPs, induced more antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, greater lymphocyte activation, stronger cross-presentation, and more generation of memory T cells, antibody, IFN-\u03b3, and granzyme B. Prophylactic vaccination of MAN-OVA-IMNPs significantly delayed tumor development and prolonged the survival in mice. The therapeutic tumor challenge indicated that MAN-OVA-IMNPs prohibited tumor progression more efficiently than other formulations, and the combination with an immune checkpoint blockade further enhanced antitumor effects. Hence, the DC-targeted vaccine codelivery with IMQ and MPLA adjuvants by hybrid cationic nanoparticles in a spatiotemporal manner is a promising multifunctional antigen delivery system in cancer immunotherapy."

However, the mechanism of Cd-induced mammary tumorigenesis remains elusive. In our study, a transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops tumors through overexpression of wild-type Erbb2 (MMTV-Erbb2) was constructed to investigate the effects of Cd exposure on BC tumorigenesis. The results showed that oral exposure to 3.6\u00a0mg/L Cd for 23\u00a0weeks dramatically accelerated tumor appearance and growth, increased Ki67 density and enhanced focal necrosis and neovascularization in the tumor tissue of MMTV-Erbb2 mice. Notably, Cd exposure enhanced glutamine (Gln) metabolism in tumor tissue, and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), a Gln metabolism antagonist, inhibited Cd-induced breast carcinogenesis. Then our metagenomic sequencing and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics confirmed that Cd exposure disturbed gut microbiota homeostasis, especially Helicobacter and Campylobacter abundance remodeling, which altered the gut metabolic homeostasis of Gln. Moreover, intratumoral Gln metabolism profoundly increased under Cd-elevated gut permeability. Importantly, depletion of microbiota with an antibiotic cocktail (AbX) treatment led to a significant delay in the appearance of palpable tumors, inhibition of tumor growth, decrease in tumor weight, reduction in Ki67 expression and low-grade pathology in Cd-exposed MMTV-Erbb2 mice. Also, transplantation of Cd-modulated microbiota decreased tumor latency, accelerated tumor growth, increased tumor weight, upregulated Ki67 expression and exacerbated neovascularization as well as focal necrosis in MMTV-Erbb2 mice. In summary, Cd exposure induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, elevated gut permeability and increased intratumoral Gln metabolism, leading to the promotion of mammary tumorigenesis. This study provides novel insights into environmental Cd exposure-mediated carcinogenesis."

Cd promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells, facilitating BC cell aggressiveness and invasion, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Hence, transgenic MMTV-Erbb2 mice (6\u00a0weeks) were orally administered Cd (3.6\u00a0mg/L, approximately equal to 19.64\u00a0\u03bc\u039c) for 23\u00a0weeks, and BC cells (BT474 cells) were exposed to Cd (0, 0.1, 1 or 10\u00a0\u03bc\u039c) for 72\u00a0h to investigate the effect of Cd exposure on EMT in BC cells. Chronic Cd exposure dramatically expedited tumor metastasis to multiple organs; decreased E-cadherin density; and increased Vimentin, N-cadherin, ZEB1, and Twist density in the tumor tissues of MMTV-Erbb2 mice. Notably, transcriptomic analysis of BC tumors revealed cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) as a key factor that regulates EMT progression in Cd-treated MMTV-Erbb2 mice. Moreover, Cd increased CYP1B1 expression in MMTV-Erbb2 mouse BC tumors and in BT474 cells, and CYP1B1 inhibition decreased Cd-induced BC cell malignancy and EMT in BT474 cells. Importantly, the promotion of EMT by CYP1B1 in Cd-treated BC cells was presumably controlled by glutamine metabolism. This study offers novel perspectives into the effect of environmental Cd exposure on driving BC progression and metastasis, and this study provides important guidance for comprehensively assessing the ecological and health risks of Cd."

In particular, caloric restriction (CR) has been reported to suppress mammary tumorigenesis in various models. However, the underlying cancer preventive mechanisms have not been fully explored. To this end, we aimed to characterize the anticancer mechanisms of CR using MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic mice, a well-established spontaneous ErbB2-overexpressing mammary tumor model, by focusing on cellular and molecular changes in premalignant tissues. In MMTV-ErbB2 mice with 30% CR beginning at 8 weeks of age, mammary tumor development was dramatically inhibited, as exhibited by reduced tumor incidence and increased tumor latency. Morphogenic mammary gland analyses in 15- and 20-week-old mice indicated that CR significantly decreased mammary epithelial cell (MEC) density and proliferative index. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the effects of CR on mammary stem/progenitor cells. Results from fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses showed that CR modified mammary tissue hierarchy dynamics, as evidenced by decreased luminal cells (CD24highCD49flow), putative mammary reconstituting unit subpopulation (CD24highCD49fhigh) and luminal progenitor cells (CD61highCD49fhigh). Mammosphere and colony-forming cell assays demonstrated that CR significantly inhibited mammary stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell numbers. Molecular analyses indicated that CR concurrently inhibited estrogen receptor (ER) and ErbB2 signaling. These molecular changes were accompanied by decreased mRNA levels of ER-targeted genes and epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB2 family members and ligands, suggesting ER-ErbB2 signaling cross-talk. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CR significantly impacts ER and ErbB2 signaling, which induces profound changes in MEC reprogramming, and mammary stem/progenitor cell inhibition is a critical mechanism of CR-mediated breast cancer prevention."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound used to produce plastics and epoxy resins. BPA can leach from these products in appreciable amounts, resulting in nearly ubiquitous daily exposure to humans. Whether BPA is harmful to humans, especially when administered orally in concentrations relevant to humans, is a topic of debate. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the role of chronic oral exposure to BPA during adulthood on mammary carcinogenesis by using a transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops tumors through overexpression of wild-type erbB2 [mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-erbB2]. METHODS: MMTV-erbB2 mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 25, 250, or 2,500 \u00b5g BPA/L drinking water from 56 until 112 days of age (for mechanism of action) or 252 days of age (for tumorigenesis). Cellular and molecular mechanisms of BPA action in the mammary gland were investigated via immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Only low doses of BPA significantly decreased tumor latency and increased tumor multiplicity, tumor burden, and the incidence of metastasis. All BPA doses significantly increased the cell proliferation index, but only the higher doses also increased the apoptotic index in the mammary gland. At the molecular level, 25 \u00b5g BPA/L, but not 2,500 \u00b5g BPA/L, increased phosphorylation of erbB2, erbB3, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and Akt in the mammary gland. DISCUSSION: Low, but not high, BPA doses significantly accelerated mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis in MMTV-erbB2 mice. The combined ratio of cell proliferation and apoptosis indices and alterations in protein expression best predicted the ability of each dose of BPA to alter tumorigenesis in this model."

                "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that parity enhances HER2/ErbB2/Neu-induced breast tumorigenesis. Furthermore, recent studies using multiparous, ErbB2/Neu-overexpressing mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-Neu) mice have shown that parity induces a population of cells that are targeted for ErbB2/Neu-induced transformation. Although parity accelerates mammary tumorigenesis, the pattern of tumor development in multiparous MMTV-Neu mice remains stochastic, suggesting that additional events are required for ErbB2/Neu to cause mammary tumors. Whether such events are genetic in nature or reflective of the dynamic hormonal control of the gland that occurs with pregnancy remains unclear. We postulated that young age at pregnancy initiation or chronic trophic maintenance of mammary epithelial cells might provide a cellular environment that significantly increases susceptibility to ErbB2/Neu-induced tumorigenesis. MMTV-Neu mice that were maintained pregnant or lactating beginning at 3 weeks of age demonstrated accelerated tumorigenesis, but this process was still stochastic, indicating that early pregnancy does not provide the requisite events of tumorigenesis. However, bitransgenic mice that were generated by breeding MMTV-Neu mice with a luteinizing hormone-overexpressing mouse model of ovarian hyperstimulation developed multifocal mammary tumors in an accelerated, synchronous manner compared to virgin MMTV-Neu animals. This synchrony of tumor development in the bitransgenic mice suggests that trophic maintenance of the mammary gland provides the additional events required for tumor formation and maintains the population of cells that are targeted by ErbB2/Neu for transformation. Both the synchrony of tumor appearance and the ability to characterize a window of commitment by ovariectomy/palpation studies permitted microarray analysis to evaluate changes in gene expression over a defined timeline that spans the progression from normal to preneoplastic mammary tissue. These approaches led to identification of several candidate genes whose expression changes in the mammary gland with commitment to ErbB2/Neu-induced tumorigenesis, suggesting that they may either be regulated by ErbB2/Neu and/or contribute to tumor formation."

Although DMBA\u2011 and ErbB2\u2011mediated breast cancers are well\u2011studied in their respective models, key interactions between environmental and genetic factors on breast cancer risk remain unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of DMBA exposure on ErbB2\u2011mediated mammary tumorigenesis. MMTV\u2011ErbB2 transgenic mice exposed to DMBA (1\u00a0mg) via weekly oral gavage for 6\u00a0weeks exhibited significantly enhanced mammary tumor development, as indicated by reduced tumor latency and increased tumor multiplicity compared with control mice. Whole mount analysis of premalignant mammary tissues from 15\u2011week\u2011old mice revealed increased ductal elongation and proliferative index in DMBA\u2011exposed mice. Molecular analyses of premalignant mammary tissues further indicated that DMBA exposure enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB2 and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, which was associated with increased mRNA levels of EGFR/ErbB2 family members and ER\u2011targeted genes. Furthermore, analysis of tumor karyotypes revealed that DMBA\u2011exposed tumors displayed more chromosomal alterations compared with control tumors, implicating DMBA\u2011induced chromosomal instability in tumor promotion in this model. Together, the data suggested that DMBA\u2011induced deregulation of EGFR/ErbB2\u2011ER pathways plays a critical role in the enhanced chromosomal instability and promotion of ErbB2\u2011mediated mammary tumorigenesis. The study highlighted gene\u2011environment interactions that may increase risk of breast cancer, which is a critical clinical issue."

                "abstract": "Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EPH receptor A2 (EphA2) is commonly observed in aggressive breast cancer and correlates with a poor prognosis. However, while EphA2 has been reported to enhance tumorigenesis, proliferation, and MAPK activation in several model systems, other studies suggest that EphA2 activation diminishes these processes and inhibits the activity of MAPK upon ligand stimulation. In this study, we eliminated EphA2 expression in 2 transgenic mouse models of mammary carcinoma. EphA2 deficiency impaired tumor initiation and metastatic progression in mice overexpressing ErbB2 (also known as Neu) in the mammary epithelium (MMTV-Neu mice), but not in mice overexpressing the polyomavirus middle T antigen in mammary epithelium (MMTV-PyV-mT mice). Histologic and ex vivo analyses of MMTV-Neu mouse mammary epithelium indicated that EphA2 enhanced tumor proliferation and motility. Biochemical analyses revealed that EphA2 formed a complex with ErbB2 in human and murine breast carcinoma cells, resulting in enhanced activation of Ras-MAPK signaling and RhoA GTPase. Additionally, MMTV-Neu, but not MMTV-PyV-mT, tumors were sensitive to therapeutic inhibition of EphA2. These data suggest that EphA2 cooperates with ErbB2 to promote tumor progression in mice and may provide a novel therapeutic target for ErbB2-dependent tumors in humans. Moreover, EphA2 function in tumor progression appeared to depend on oncogene context, an important consideration for the application of therapies targeting EphA2."

The goal of this study was to determine whether gut Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) is involved in the regulation of intratumoral microbiome and metabolic contexture, leading to an anticancer effect on lung cancer. We evaluated the effects of gut endogenous or gavaged exogenous Akk on the tumorigenesis using the Lewis lung cancer mouse model. Feces, blood, and tumor tissue samples were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing. We then conducted spatially resolved metabolomics profiling to discover cancer metabolites in situ directly and to characterize the overall Akk-regulated metabolic features, followed by the correlation analysis of intratumoral bacteria with metabolic network. Our results showed that both endogenous and exogenous gavaged Akk significantly inhibited tumorigenesis. Moreover, we detected increased Akk abundance in blood circulation or tumor tissue by 16S rDNA sequencing in the Akk gavaged mice, compared with the control mice. Of great interest, gavaged Akk may migrate into tumor tissue and influence the composition of intratumoral microbiome. Spatially resolved metabolomics analysis revealed that the gut-derived Akk was able to regulate tumor metabolic pathways, from metabolites to enzymes. Finally, our study identified a significant correlation between the gut Akk-regulated intratumoral bacteria and metabolic network. Together, gut-derived Akk may migrate into blood circulation, and subsequently colonize into lung cancer tissue, which contributes to the suppression of tumorigenesis by influencing tumoral symbiotic microbiome and reprogramming tumoral metabolism, although more studies are needed."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rho GTPases are overexpressed and hyperactivated in human breast cancers. Deficiency of p190B RhoGAP, a major inhibitor of the Rho GTPases, inhibits mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV)-Neu/ErbB2 mammary tumor formation and progression in part through effects within the stromal environment, suggesting that p190B function is pro-tumorigenic. To further investigate the potential pro-tumorigenic actions of p190B, we examined the effects of exogenous p190B expression within the mammary epithelium on MMTV-Neu tumor formation and progression. METHODS: Tetracycline-regulatable p190B transgenic mice were bred to MMTV-Neu mice, and the effects of exogenous p190B expression on tumor latency, multiplicity, growth rates, angiogenesis, and metastasis were examined. The effects of exogenous p190B expression on cell-matrix adhesion and invasion were tested using non-transformed primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Rho GTPase activity, oxidative stress as an indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and downstream signaling pathways were analyzed. RESULTS: Altered p190B expression resulted in a 2-fold increase in tumor multiplicity and a 3-fold increase in metastases compared to control mice indicating that exogenous p190B expression in the mammary epithelium promotes MMTV-Neu mammary tumor formation and progression. Interestingly, non-transformed primary MECs expressing exogenous p190B displayed increased adhesion to laminin and type IV collagen and formed invasive structures in a three-dimensional culture assay. Ras related C3 botulinum toxin 1 (Rac1)-GTP levels were elevated in p190B transgenic tumors whereas Ras homologous A (RhoA) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42)-GTP levels were not significantly altered. Rac1 activity affects production of ROS, which regulate transformation, metastasis, and oxidative stress. Protein carbonylation, which is indicative of oxidative stress, was elevated 1.75-fold in p190B transgenic tumors as compared to control tumors suggesting that exogenous p190B expression may affect Rac1-dependent ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that paradoxically, p190B RhoGAP, a major inhibitor of the Rho GTPases in vitro, has pro-tumorigenic functions that enhance MMTV-Neu induced mammary tumor formation and metastasis. Furthermore, exogenous p190B expression enhances cell adhesion and invasion, which may facilitate metastasis. Rac1 activity and oxidative stress are elevated in tumors expressing exogenous p190B suggesting that p190B may promote tumorigenesis through a Rac1/ROS dependent mechanism."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Altered tumor cell metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer; however, the precise role for glucose in tumor initiation is not known. GLUT1 (SLC2A1) is expressed in breast cancer cells and is likely responsible for avid glucose uptake observed in established tumors. We have shown that GLUT1 was necessary for xenograft tumor formation from primary mammary cells transformed with the polyomavirus middle-T antigen but that it was not necessary for growth after tumors had formed in vivo, suggesting a differential requirement for glucose depending on the stage of tumorigenesis. METHODS: To determine whether GLUT1 is required early during mammary tumorigenesis, we crossed MMTV-NIC mice, which express activated HER2/NEU/ERBB2 and Cre recombinase, to Slc2a1 Flox/Flox (GLUT1Flox/Flox) mice to generate NIC-GLUT1+/+, NIC-GLUT1Flox/+, and NIC-GLUT1Flox/Flox mice. In addition, we evaluated effects of glucose restriction or GLUT1 inhibition on transformation in MCF10A-ERBB2 breast epithelial cells in three-dimensional culture. Finally, we utilized global gene expression profiling data of primary human breast tumors to determine the relationship between SLC2A1 and stage of tumorigenesis. RESULTS: All of the NIC-GLUT1+/+ mice developed tumors in less than 200\u00a0days. In contrast, only 1 NIC-GLUT1Flox/Flox mouse and 1 NIC-GLUT1Flox/+ mouse developed mammary tumors, even after 18\u00a0months. Mammary gland development was not disrupted in NIC mice lacking GLUT1; however, epithelial content of mature glands was reduced compared to NIC-GLUT1Flox/+ mice. In MCF10A-ERBB2 cells, glucose restriction or GLUT1 inhibition blocked transformation induced by activated ERBB2 through reduced cell proliferation. In human breast cancers, SLC2A1 was higher in ductal carcinoma in situ compared to the normal breast, but lower in invasive versus in situ lesions, suggesting the requirement for GLUT1 decreases as tumors progress. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a strict requirement for GLUT1 in the early stages of mammary tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. While metabolic adaptation has emerged as a hallmark of cancer, our data indicate that early tumor cells rely heavily on glucose and highlight the potential for glucose restriction as a breast cancer preventive strategy."

Studies suggest a link between perinatal BPA exposure and increased breast cancer risk, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of in utero BPA exposure on mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-erbB2 transgenic mice. Pregnant mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0, 50, 500 ng/kg and 250 \u00b5g/kg BW) daily between gestational days 11-19. Female offspring were examined for mammary tumorigenesis, puberty onset, mammary morphogenesis, and signaling in ER and erbB2 pathways. In utero exposure to low dose BPA (500 ng/kg) induced mammary tumorigenesis, earlier puberty onset, increased terminal end buds, and prolonged estrus phase, which was accompanied by proliferative mammary morphogenesis. CD24/49f-based FACS analysis showed that in utero exposure to 500 ng/kg BPA induced expansion of luminal and basal/myoepithelial cell subpopulations at PND 35. Molecular analysis of mammary tissues at PND 70 showed that in utero exposure to low doses of BPA induced upregulation of ER\u03b1, p-ER\u03b1, cyclin D1, and c-myc, concurrent activation of erbB2, EGFR, erbB-3, Erk1/2, and Akt, and upregulation of growth factors/ligands. Our results demonstrate that in utero exposure to low dose BPA promotes mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-erbB2 mice through induction of ER-erbB2 crosstalk and mammary epithelial reprogramming, which advance our understanding of the mechanism associated with in utero exposure to BPA-induced breast cancer risk. The studies also support using MMTV-erbB2 mouse model for relevant studies."

                "abstract": "RANK ligand (RANKL), a TNF-related molecule, is essential for osteoclast formation, function and survival through interaction with its receptor RANK. Mammary glands of RANK- and RANKL-deficient mice develop normally during sexual maturation, but fail to form lobuloalveolar structures during pregnancy because of defective proliferation and increased apoptosis of mammary epithelium. It has been shown that RANKL is responsible for the major proliferative response of mouse mammary epithelium to progesterone during mammary lactational morphogenesis, and in mouse models, manipulated to induce activation of the RANK/RANKL pathway in the absence of strict hormonal control, inappropriate mammary proliferation is observed. However, there is no evidence so far of a functional contribution of RANKL to tumorigenesis. Here we show that RANK and RANKL are expressed within normal, pre-malignant and neoplastic mammary epithelium, and using complementary gain-of-function (mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-RANK transgenic mice) and loss-of function (pharmacological inhibition of RANKL) approaches, define a direct contribution of this pathway in mammary tumorigenesis. Accelerated pre-neoplasias and increased mammary tumour formation were observed in MMTV-RANK transgenic mice after multiparity or treatment with carcinogen and hormone (progesterone). Reciprocally, selective pharmacological inhibition of RANKL attenuated mammary tumour development not only in hormone- and carcinogen-treated MMTV-RANK and wild-type mice, but also in the MMTV-neu transgenic spontaneous tumour model. The reduction in tumorigenesis upon RANKL inhibition was preceded by a reduction in pre-neoplasias as well as rapid and sustained reductions in hormone- and carcinogen-induced mammary epithelial proliferation and cyclin D1 levels. Collectively, our results indicate that RANKL inhibition is acting directly on hormone-induced mammary epithelium at early stages in tumorigenesis, and the permissive contribution of progesterone to increased mammary cancer incidence is due to RANKL-dependent proliferative changes in the mammary epithelium. The current study highlights a potential role for RANKL inhibition in the management of proliferative breast disease."

The mechanism of Cd-induced liver injury remains elusive. Our study aimed to clarify the mechanism by which changes in the gut microbiota contribute to Cd-induced liver injury. Here, a murine model of liver injury induced by chronic Cd exposure was used. Liver injury was assessed by biochemistry and histopathology. Expression profiles of genes involved in bile acid (BA) homeostasis, inflammation and injury were assessed via Realtime-PCR and Western-blot. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics were used to investigate changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolites in the regulation of Cd-induced liver injury. Here, we showed that Cd exposure induced hepatic ductular proliferation, hepatocellular damage and inflammatory infiltration in mice. Cd exposure induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and reduced the fecal bile salt hydrolase activity leading to an increase of tauro-\u03b2-muricholic acid levels in the intestine. Cd exposure decreased intestine FXR/FGF-15 signaling and promoted hepatic BA synthesis. Furthermore, the mice receiving fecal microbiota transplantation from Cd-treated mice showed reduced intestinal FXR/FGF-15 signaling, increased hepatic BA synthesis, and liver injury. However, the depletion of the commensal microbiota by antibiotics failed to change these indices in Cd-treated mice. Finally, the administration of the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine attenuated the liver injury, improved the intestinal barrier, and decreased hepatic BA synthesis in the Cd-treated mice. Our study identified a new mechanism of Cd-induced liver injury. Cd-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, decreased feces BSH activity, and increased intestinal T-\u03b2MCA levels led to an inhibition of intestinal FXR/FGF-15 signaling and an increase in hepatic BA synthesis, ultimately facilitating the development of hepatic ductular proliferation, inflammation, and injury in mice. This study expands our understanding of the health hazards caused by environmental Cd pollution."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although chemopreventative agents targeting the estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) pathway have been effective for ER+ breast cancers, prevention of hormone receptor-negative breast cancers, such as Her2/erbB-2+ breast cancers, remains a significant issue. Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of EGFR/erbB-2-targeting lapatinib to MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice inhibited mammary tumor development. The prevention, however, was achieved by prolonged high dose exposure. The tolerance to high dose/long-term drug administration may hinder its potential in clinical settings. Therefore, we aimed to test a novel, short-term chemopreventative strategy using lapatinib during the premalignant risk window in MMTV-erbB-2 mice. METHODS: We initially treated cultured cells with lapatinib to explore the anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib in vitro. We used a syngeneic tumor graft model to begin exploring the in vivo anti-tumorigenic effects of lapatinib in MMTV-erbB-2 mice. Then, we tested the efficacy of brief exposure to lapatinib (100\u00a0mg/kg/day for 8\u00a0weeks), beginning at 16\u00a0weeks of age, in the prevention of mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB-2 mice. RESULTS: In the syngeneic tumor transplant model, we determined that lapatinib significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short-term lapatinib exposure resulted in life-long protective effects, as supported by increased tumor latency in lapatinib-treated mice compared to the control mice. We further established that delayed tumor development in the treated mice was preceded by decreased BrdU nuclear incorporation and inhibited mammary morphogenesis. Molecular analysis indicated that lapatinib inhibited phosphorylation and expression of EGFR, erbB-3, erbB-2, Akt1, and Erk1/2 in premalignant mammary tissues. Also, lapatinib drastically inhibited the phosphorylation and expression of ER\u03b1 and the transcription of ER target genes in premalignant mammary tissues. We also determined that lapatinib suppressed the stemness of breast cancer cell lines, as evidenced by decreased tumorsphere formation and ALDH+ cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that brief treatment with EGFR/erbB-2-targeting agents before the onset of tumors may provide lifelong protection from mammary tumors, through the concurrent inhibition of erbB-2 and ER signaling pathways and consequential reprogramming. Our findings support further clinical testing to explore the benefit of shorter lapatinib exposure in the prevention of erbB-2-mediated carcinogenesis."

We have examined the consequences of genetic ablation of Nedd9 in the MMTV-HER2/ERBB2/neu mouse mammary tumor model. Unexpectedly, we found that only a limited effect on metastasis in MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mice compared with MMTV-neu;Nedd9(+/+) mice, but instead a dramatic reduction in tumor incidence (18 versus 80%), and a significantly increased latency until tumor appearance. Orthotopic reinjection and tail-vein injection of cells arising from tumors, coupled with in vivo analysis, indicated tumors arising in MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mice had undergone mutational selection that overcame the initial requirement for Nedd9. To better understand the defects in early tumor growth, we compared mammary progenitor cell pools from MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) versus MMTV-neu;Nedd9(+/+) mice. The MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) genotype selectively reduced both the number and colony-forming potential of mammary luminal epithelial progenitor cells, while not affecting basal epithelial progenitors. MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mammospheres had striking defects in morphology and cell polarity. All of these defects were seen predominantly in the context of the HER2/neu oncogene, and were not associated with randomization of the plane of mitotic division, but rather with depressed expression the cell attachment protein FAK, accompanied by increased sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors of FAK and SRC. Surprisingly, in spite of these significant differences, only minimal changes were observed in the gene expression profile of Nedd9(-/-) mice, indicating critical Nedd9-dependent differences in cell growth properties were mediated via post-transcriptional regulation of cell signaling. Coupled with emerging data indicating a role for NEDD9 in progenitor cell populations during the morphogenesis of other tissues, these results indicate a functional requirement for NEDD9 in the growth of mammary cancer progenitor cells.

The ability to investigate the critical events underlying cancer initiation and progression, as well as the capacity to test the efficacy of novel therapeutics, has been significantly advanced by the development of genetically engineered mice (GEMs) that accurately recapitulate specific human cancers. We utilized three transgenic mouse models to better comprehend the in vivo role of MDA-7/IL-24 in breast cancer. Using the MMTV-PyMT spontaneous mammary tumor model, we confirmed that exogenously introducing MDA-7/IL-24 using a Cancer Terminator Virus caused a reduction in tumor burden and also produced an antitumor \"bystander\" effect. Next we performed xenograft studies in a newly created MMTV-MDA-7 transgenic model that over-expresses MDA-7/IL-24 in the mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation, and found that MDA-7/IL-24 overexpression delayed tumor growth following orthotopic injection of a murine PDX tumor cell line (mPDX) derived from a tumor formed in an MMTV-PyMT mouse. We also crossed the MMTV-MDA-7 line to MMTV-Erbb2 transgenic mice and found that MDA-7/IL-24 overexpression delayed the onset of mammary tumor development in this model of spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis as well. Finally, we assessed the role of MDA-7/IL-24 in immune regulation, which can potentially contribute to tumor suppression in vivo. Our findings provide further direct in vivo evidence for the role of MDA-7/IL-24 in tumor suppression in breast cancer in immune-competent transgenic mice. "

Meta-analysis of ErbB2-positive breast cancers shows increased PKC\u03b4 expression, and a negative correlation between PKC\u03b4 expression and prognosis. Here, we present in-vivo evidence that PKC\u03b4 is essential for the development of mammary gland tumors in a ErbB2-overexpressing transgenic mouse model, and in-vitro evidence that PKC\u03b4 is required for proliferative signaling downstream of the ErbB2 receptor. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-ErbB2 mice lacking PKC\u03b4 (\u03b4KO) have increased tumor latency compared with MMTV-ErbB2 wild-type (\u03b4WT) mice, and the tumors show a dramatic decrease in Ki-67 staining. To explore the relationship between PKC\u03b4 and ErbB2-driven proliferation more directly, we used MCF-10A cells engineered to express a synthetic ligand-inducible form of the ErbB2 receptor. Depletion of PKC\u03b4 with short hairpin RNA inhibited ligand-induced growth in both two-dimensional (2D) (plastic) and three-dimensional (3D) (Matrigel) culture, and correlated with decreased phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor and reduced activation of Src and MAPK/ERK pathways. Similarly, in human breast cancer cell lines in which ErbB2 is overexpressed, depletion of PKC\u03b4 suppresses proliferation, Src and ERK activation. PKC\u03b4 appears to drive proliferation through the formation of an active ErbB2/PKC\u03b4/Src signaling complex, as depletion of PKC\u03b4 disrupts association of Src with the ErbB2 receptor. Taken together, our studies present the first evidence that PKC\u03b4 is a critical regulator of ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis, and suggest further investigation of PKC\u03b4 as a target in ErbB2-positive breast cancer.

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is hypothesized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer. METHODS: To directly evaluate the role of FAK in mammary tumour progression, we have used a conditional FAK mouse model and mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-driven Cre recombinase strain to inactivate FAK in the mammary epithelium of a transgenic mouse model of ErbB2 breast cancer. RESULTS: Although mammary epithelial disruption of FAK in this model resulted in both a delay in onset and a decrease in the number of neoplastic lesions, mammary tumours occurred in 100% of virgin female mice. All of the tumours and derived metastases that developed were proficient for FAK due to the absence of Cre recombinase expression. The hyperplastic epithelia where Cre-mediated recombination of FAK could be detected exhibited a profound proliferative defect. Consistent with these observations, disruption of FAK in established tumour cells resulted in reduced tumour growth that was associated with impaired proliferation. To avoid the selection for FAK-proficient ErbB2 tumour epithelia through escape of Cre-mediated recombination, we next intercrossed the FAK conditional mice with a separate MMTV-driven ErbB2 strain that co-expressed ErbB2 and Cre recombinase on the same transcriptional unit. CONCLUSIONS: While a delay in tumour induction was noted, FAK-deficient tumours arose in 100% of female animals indicating that FAK is dispensable for ErbB2 tumour initiation. In addition, the FAK-null ErbB2 tumours retained their metastatic potential. We further demonstrated that the FAK-related Pyk2 kinase is still expressed in these tumours and is associated with its downstream regulator p130Cas. These observations indicate that Pyk2 can functionally substitute for FAK in ErbB2 mammary tumour progression."

                "abstract": "The Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 22 (USP22), a component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) histone modifying complex, is overexpressed in multiple human cancers, but how USP22 impacts tumorigenesis is not clear. We reported previously that Usp22 loss in mice impacts execution of several signaling pathways driven by growth factor receptors such as erythroblastic oncogene B b2 (ERBB2). To determine whether changes in USP22 expression affects ERBB2-driven tumorigenesis, we introduced conditional overexpression or deletion alleles of Usp22 into mice bearing the Mouse mammary tumor virus-Neu-Ires-Cre (MMTV-NIC) transgene, which drives both rat ERBB2/NEU expression and Cre recombinase activity from the MMTV promoter resulting in mammary tumor formation. We found that USP22 overexpression in mammary glands did not further enhance primary tumorigenesis in MMTV-NIC female mice, but increased lung metastases were observed. However, deletion of Usp22 significantly decreased tumor burden and increased survival of MMTV-NIC mice. These effects were associated with markedly decreased levels of both Erbb2 mRNA and protein, indicating Usp22 loss impacts MMTV promoter activity. Usp22 loss had no impact on ERBB2 expression in other settings, including MCF10A cells bearing a Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven ERBB2 transgene or in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ human SKBR3 and HCC1953 cells. Decreased activity of the MMTV promoter in MMTV-NIC mice correlated with decreased expression of known regulatory factors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the progesterone receptor (PR), and the chromatin remodeling factor Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1). Together our findings indicate that increased expression of USP22 does not augment the activity of an activated ERBB2/NEU transgene but impacts of Usp22 loss on tumorigenesis cannot be assessed in this model due to unexpected effects on MMTV-driven Erbb2/Neu expression."

                "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) is commonly expressed in both the epithelium of normal mammary glands and in breast cancers. AR expression in breast cancers is independent of estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) status and is frequently associated with overexpression of the ERBB2 oncogene. AR signaling effects on breast cancer progression may depend on ER\u03b1 and ERBB2 status. Up to 30% of human breast cancers are driven by overactive ERBB2 signaling and it is not clear whether AR expression affects any steps of tumor progression in this cohort of patients. To test this, we generated mammary specific Ar depleted mice (MARKO) by combining the floxed allele of Ar with the MMTV-cre transgene on an MMTV-NeuNT background and compared them to littermate MMTV-NeuNT, Ar(fl)/+ control females. Heterozygous MARKO females displayed reduced levels of AR in mammary glands with mosaic AR expression in ductal epithelium. The loss of AR dramatically accelerated the onset of MMTV-NeuNT tumors in female MARKO mice. In this report we show that accelerated MMTV-NeuNT-dependent tumorigenesis is due specifically to the loss of AR, as hormonal levels, estrogen and progesterone receptors expression, and MMTV-NeuNT expression were similar between MARKO and control groups. MMTV-NeuNT induced tumors in both cohorts displayed distinct loss of AR in addition to ER\u03b1, PR, and the pioneer factor FOXA1. Erbb3 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in tumors in comparison to normal mammary glands. Thus the loss of AR in mouse mammary epithelium accelerates malignant transformation rather than the rate of tumorigenesis."

                "abstract": "Although it has been demonstrated that transformed progenitor cell population can contribute to tumor initiation, factors contributing to this malignant transformation are poorly known. Using in vitro and xenograft-based models, previous studies demonstrated that miR-489 acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA by targeting various oncogenic pathways. It has been demonstrated that miR-489 directly targets HER2 and inhibits the HER2 signaling pathway; however, its role in mammary gland development and HER2-induced tumor initiation hasn't been studied. To dissect the role of miR-489, we sorted different populations of mammary epithelial cells and determined that miR-489 was highly expressed in mammary stem cells. MMTV-miR-489 mice that overexpressed miR-489 in mammary epithelial cells were developed and these mice exhibited an inhibition of mammary gland development in early ages with a specific impact on highly proliferative cells. Double transgenic MMTV-Her2-miR489 mice were then generated to observe how miR-489 overexpression affects HER2-induced tumorigenesis. miR-489 overexpression delayed HER2-induced tumor initiation significantly. Moreover, miR-489 overexpression inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis. miR-489 overexpression reduced mammary progenitor cell population significantly in preneoplastic mammary glands of MMTV-Her2 mice which showed a putative transformed population in HER2-induced tumorigenesis. The miR-489 overexpression reduced CD49fhiCD61hi populations in tumors that have stem-like properties, and miR-489 overexpression altered the HER2 signaling pathway in mammary tumors. Altogether, these data indicate that the inhibition of HER2-induced tumorigenesis by miR-489 overexpression was due to altering progenitor cell populations while decreasing tumor growth and metastasis via influencing tumor promoting genes DEK and SHP2."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer vaccines are able to achieve tumor-specific immune editing in early-phase clinical trials. However, the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into immune-deserted tumors is still a major limiting factor. An optimized vaccine approach to induce antigen-specific T cells that can perform robust tumor infiltration is important to accelerate their clinical translation. We previously developed a STING-activating PC7A nanovaccine that produces a strong anti-tumor T cell response on subcutaneous injection. This study systematically investigated the impact of administration methods on the performance of nanovaccines. METHODS: Tumor growth inhibition by intratumoral delivery and subcutaneous delivery of nanovaccine was investigated in TC-1 human papillomavirus-induced cancer model and B16-OVA melanoma model. Nanovaccine distribution in vivo was detected by clinical camera imaging, systemic T cell activation and tumor infiltration were tested by in vivo cytotoxicity killing assay and flow cytometry. For mechanism analysis, T cell recruitment was investigated by in vivo migration blocking assay, multiplex chemokine array, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, chemotaxis assay and gene knockout mice. RESULTS: Nanovaccine administration was found to alter T cell production and infiltration in tumors. Intratumoral delivery of nanovaccines displayed superior antitumor effects in multiple tumor models compared with subcutaneous delivery. Mechanistic investigation revealed that intratumoral administration of the nanovaccine significantly increased the infiltration of antigen-specific T cells in TC-1 tumors, despite the lower systemic levels of T cells compared with subcutaneous injection. The inhibition of tumor growth by nanovaccines is primarily dependent on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Nanovaccine accumulation in tumors upregulates CXCL9 expression in myeloid cells in a STING dependent manner, leading to increased recruitment of IFN\u03b3-expressing CD8+ T cells from the periphery, and IFN\u03b3 reciprocally stimulates CXCL9 expression in myeloid cells, resulting in positive feedback between myeloid-CXCL9 and T cell-IFN\u03b3 to promote T cell recruitment. However, the STING agonist alone could not sustain this effect in the presence of a systemic deficiency in antigen-specific T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that intratumoral administration of PC7A nanovaccine achieved stronger antitumor immunity and efficacy over subcutaneous injection. These data suggest intratumoral administration should be included in the therapeutic design in the clinical use of nanovaccine."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Optimal approaches to induce T cell infiltration of tumors are not known. Chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 support effector T cell recruitment and may be induced by IFN. This study tests the hypothesis that intratumoral administration of IFN\u03b3 will induce CXCL9-11 and will induce T cell recruitment and anti-tumor immune signatures in melanoma metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine eligible patients were immunized with a vaccine comprised of 12 class I MHC-restricted melanoma peptides and received IFN\u03b3 intratumorally. Effects on the tumor microenvironment were evaluated in sequential tumor biopsies. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. T cell responses to vaccination were assessed in PBMC by IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. Tumor biopsies were evaluated for immune cell infiltration, chemokine protein expression, and gene expression. RESULTS: Vaccination and intratumoral administration of IFN\u03b3 were well tolerated. Circulating T cell responses to vaccine were detected in six of nine patients. IFN\u03b3 increased production of chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5 in patient tumors. Neither vaccination alone, nor the addition of IFN\u03b3 promoted immune cell infiltration or induced anti-tumor immune gene signatures. CONCLUSION: The melanoma vaccine induced circulating T cell responses, but it failed to infiltrate metastases, thus highlighting the need for combination strategies to support T cell infiltration. A single intratumoral injection of IFN\u03b3 induced T cell-attracting chemokines; however, it also induced secondary immune regulation that may paradoxically limit immune infiltration and effector functions. Alternate dosing strategies or additional combinatorial treatments may be needed to promote trafficking and retention of tumor-reactive T cells in melanoma metastases."

                "abstract": "Combining different immunotherapy approaches is currently building the future of immunotherapy, with the view to maximize anti-tumoral efficacy for larger patient population. The KISIMA\u2122 platform allows the development of protein-based cancer vaccines able to induce tumor-specific T cell response resulting in anti-tumoral efficacy in various mouse models. Intra-tumoral administration of stimulator of interferon gene agonists (STINGa) was shown to induce a potent inflammatory response leading to the development of tumor-specific immunity. Here, we explored the efficacy and mechanisms of action of subcutaneous STINGa treatment combined with therapeutic vaccination in various mouse tumor models. This combinatory treatment highly enhanced frequency and effector function of both peripheral and intra-tumoral antigen-specific CD8 T cells, promoting potent IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 production along with increased cytotoxicity. Moreover, combination therapy favorably modulated the tumor microenvironment by dampening immune-suppressive cells and increasing CD4 T cell infiltration together with their polarization toward Th1 phenotype. Combination with STINGa treatment improved the effect of therapeutic vaccination, resulting in a prolonged control and slower growth of B16-OVA and TC-1 tumors. Altogether, the results presented here highlight the potential of combining STINGa with a therapeutic protein vaccine for cancer treatment."

                "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) offer new options for the treatment of patients with solid cancers worldwide. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRC) are proficient in mismatch-repair (pMMR) genes, harboring fewer tumor antigens and are insensitive to ICIs. These tumors are often found to be immune-deserted. We hypothesized that forcing immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment followed by immune ignition by PD1 blockade may initiate a positive immune cycle that can boost antitumor immunity. Bioinformatics using a public database suggested that IFN\u03b3 was a key indicator of immune status and prognosis in CRC. Intratumoral administration of IFN\u03b3 increased immune cells infiltration into the tumor, but induced PD-L1 expression. A combined treatment strategy using IFN\u03b3 and anti-PD-1 antibody significantly increased T cell killing of tumor cells in vitro and showed synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model of CRC. CyTOF found drastic changes in the immune microenvironment upon combined immunotherapy. Treatment with IFN\u03b3 and anti-PD1 antibody in CT26 tumors significantly increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). IFN\u03b3 had a more pronounced effect in decreasing intratumoral M2-like macrophages, while PD1 blockade increased the population of CD8+Ly6C\u00a0+\u00a0T cells in the tumor microenvironment, creating a more pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, PD1 induced increased expression of lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3) in a significant fraction of CD8+ T cells and Treg cells, indicating potential drug resistance and feedback mechanisms. In conclusion, our work provides preclinical data for the Combined immunotherapy of CRC using intratumoral delivery of IFN\u03b3 and systemic anti-PD1 monoclonoal antibody."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: The route of administration of a therapeutic tumor vaccine is a critical factor in inducing antitumor activity. In this study, we explored the effects of three vaccination routes (subcutaneous, peritumoral, and intratumoral injection) on antitumor activity induced by a human papillomavirus (HPV) therapeutic vaccine containing HPV16 E7 peptide combined with the adjuvant CpG ODN in established TC-1 grafted tumors. METHODS: We used flow cytometry to evaluate splenic and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We also assessed transcriptional changes in a sequence of immune-related genes in tumors of different treatment groups using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of molecules related to tumor infiltrating immune cells, angiogenesis, and cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumor tissues. RESULTS: Our results suggested that intratumoral and peritumoral vaccination generated enhanced antitumor activity compared to subcutaneous delivery. In particular, intratumoral vaccination elicited a stronger antitumor effect, with two of the six treated mice being nearly tumor-free at day 28. Three vaccination routes induced increases in splenic CD4+ and/or CD8+ T lymphocytes, and marked decreases in immunosuppressive cells. Peritumoral vaccination increased the tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells in tumors, while intratumoral vaccination enhanced the tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, as well as decreased the tumor-infiltrating of immunosuppressive cells, which may result in stronger inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing tumors. Furthermore, compared to the subcutaneous route, intratumoral vaccination led to a significant increase in antitumor cytokines and chemokines. In addition, our data showed marked downregulation of MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, CD31, and \u03b1-SMA in the intratumoral vaccination group, which might contribute to the suppression of tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. CONCLUSION: Overall, intratumoral vaccination is superior to subcutaneous delivery and has the potential to inhibit tumor growth by improving the tumor microenvironment."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) promotes growth and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells. Bioactive IL-15 is produced in the body as a heterodimeric cytokine, comprising the IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha chains (hetIL-15). Several preclinical models support the antitumor activity of hetIL-15 promoting its application in clinical trials. METHODS: The antitumor activity of hetIL-15 produced from mammalian cells was tested in mouse tumor models (MC38 colon carcinoma and TC-1 epithelial carcinoma). The functional diversity of the immune infiltrate and the cytokine/chemokine network within the tumor was evaluated by flow cytometry, multicolor immunohistochemistry (IHC), gene expression profiling by Nanostring Technologies, and protein analysis by electrochemiluminescence and ELISA assays. RESULTS: hetIL-15 treatment resulted in delayed primary tumor growth. Increased NK and CD8+ T cell tumoral infiltration with an increased CD8+/Treg ratio were found by flow cytometry and IHC in hetIL-15 treated animals. Intratumoral NK and CD8+ T cells showed activation features with enhanced interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production, proliferation (Ki67+), cytotoxic potential (Granzyme B+) and expression of the survival factor Bcl-2. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed complex effects on the tumor microenvironment triggered by hetIL-15 therapy, including increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 and XCL1 with intratumoral accumulation of XCR1+IRF8+CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1). Concomitantly, the production of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 by tumor-localized myeloid cells, including cDC1, was boosted by hetIL-15 in an IFN-\u03b3-dependent manner. An increased frequency of circulating CXCR3+ NK and CD8+ T cells was found, suggesting their ability to migrate toward the tumors following the CXCL9 and CXCL10 chemokine gradient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that hetIL-15 administration enhances T cell entry into tumors, increasing the success rate of immunotherapy interventions. Our study further supports the incorporation of hetIL-15 in tumor immunotherapy approaches to promote the development of antitumor responses by favoring effector over regulatory cells and by promoting lymphocyte and DC localization into tumors through the modification of the tumor chemokine and cytokine milieu."

                "abstract": "In previous studies, we have obtained a notable anti-tumor efficacy of the recombinant MUC1-MBP vaccine in the process of mouse B16-MUC1 melanoma treatment. However, the tumor cannot be eliminated completely. We found that the tumor inhibition rate decreased from 81.67% (five immunizations) to 43.67% (eight immunizations) after more than five immunizations, indicating persistent vaccine stimulation may activate immunosuppressive factors. In the present study, we revealed that programmed cell death 1 (PD1), an inhibitory molecule suppressing T cell function, expressed on splenic and tumor-infiltrating T cells were up-regulated by the vaccine. Therefore, to optimize the anti-tumor efficacy of the vaccine, we employed combination immunotherapy with MUC1-MBP vaccine and \u03b1PD1 (anti-PD1 antibody). Results showed that combination immunotherapy induced a more remarkable anti-tumor efficacy, the tumor clearance being increased to 80% from 20% which obtain by MUC1-MBP vaccine immunizations. To investigate the possible underlying mechanism, IFN-\u03b3 secretion and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxicity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer (RTCA) respectively. T cell subsets and immunosuppressive cells in the mouse spleen and tumor microenvironment were analyzed by FACS. Results showed that the proportion of splenic CD8+T cells and tumor infiltration was increased and the activity of CTL killing, T helper 1 (Th1), Type 1 CD8+T (Tc1) was enhanced, indicating that the anti-tumor efficacy enhanced by combination immunotherapy was mainly through boosting CD8+T cells mediated anti-tumor cellular immunity. Additionally, combination immunotherapy significantly decreased the splenic and tumor-infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These results demonstrated that combination immunotherapy with MUC1-MBP vaccine and \u03b1PD1 was capable to invoke a more potent anti-tumor immune response and provide a foundation for further research."

We tested whether, by modulating the vaccination approaches and injection times, the anti-tumour activity could be enhanced. We used a B16-HBc melanoma murine model not only to compare the efficacy of DC vaccine immunized via footpads, intravenously or via intratumoral injections in treating melanoma and priming tumour-specific immune responses, but also to observe how DC vaccination could improve the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells to induce an enhanced anti-tumour immune response. Our results indicate that, although all vaccination approaches were able to protect mice from developing melanoma, only three intratumoral injections of DCs could induce a significant anti-tumour response. Furthermore, the combination of intratumoral DC vaccination and adoptive T cell transfer led to a more robust anti-tumour response than the use of each treatment individually by increasing CD8(+) T cells or the ratio of CD8(+) T cell/regulatory T cells in the tumour site. Moreover, the combination vaccination induced tumour-specific immune responses that led to tumour regression and protected surviving mice from tumour rechallenge, which is attributed to an increase in CD127-expressing and interferon-\u03b3-producing CD8(+) T cells. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated intratumoral DC vaccination not only induces expansion of antigen-specific T cells against tumour-associated antigens in tumour sites, but also leads to elimination of pre-established tumours, supporting this combined approach as a potent strategy for DC-based cancer immunotherapy."

Here, we identified a combinatorial in situ immunomodulation strategy based on the administration of selected immunogenic drugs and immunotherapy to sensitize poorly T-cell-infiltrated neuroblastoma (NB) to the host antitumor immune response. METHODS: 975A2 and 9464D NB cell lines derived from spontaneous tumors of TH-MYCN transgenic mice were employed to study drug combinations able of enhancing the antitumor immune response using in vivo and ex vivo approaches. Migration of immune cells towards drug-treated murine-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (MDOTS) were assessed by microfluidic devices. Activation status of immune cells co-cultured with drug-treated MDOTS was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. The effect of drug treatment on the immune content of subcutaneous or orthotopic tumors was comprehensively analyzed by flow-cytometry, immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence. The chemokine array assay was used to detect soluble factors released into the tumor microenvironment. Patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) were generated from human NB specimens. Migration and activation status of autologous immune cells to drug-treated PDOTS were performed. RESULTS: We found that treatment with\u00a0low-doses of\u00a0mitoxantrone (MTX) recalled immune cells and promoted CD8+ T and NK cell activation in MDOTS when combined with TGF\u03b2 and PD-1 blockade.

A concomitant production of inflammatory chemokines involved in remodelling the tumor immune landscape was also detected. Interestingly, this treatment induced immune cell recruitment against PDOTS and activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) promotes adaptive immunity and tumor regression in some cancer patients. However, in patients with immunologically \"cold\" tumors, tumor-resident innate immune cell activation may be required to prime an adaptive immune response and so exploit the full potential of ICB. Whilst Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have been used topically to successfully treat some superficial skin tumors, systemic TLR agonists have not been well-tolerated. METHODS: The response of human immune cells to TLR7 and 8 agonism was measured in primary human immune cell assays. MEDI9197 (3M-052) was designed as a novel lipophilic TLR7/8 agonist that is retained at the injection site, limiting systemic exposure. Retention of the TLR7/8 agonist at the site of injection was demonstrated using quantitative whole-body autoradiography, HPLC-UV, and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. Pharmacodynamic changes on T cells from TLR7/8 agonist treated B16-OVA tumors was assessed by histology, quantitative real time PCR, and flow cytometry. Combination activity of TLR7/8 agonism with immunotherapies was assessed in vitro by human DC-T cell MLR assay, and in vivo using multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models. RESULTS: Targeting both TLR7 and 8 triggers an innate and adaptive immune response in primary human immune cells, exemplified by secretion of IFN\u03b1, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3. In contrast, a STING or a TLR9 agonist primarily induces release of IFN\u03b1. We demonstrate that the TLR7/8 agonist, MEDI9197, is retained at the sight of injection with limited systemic exposure. This localized TLR7/8 agonism leads to Th1 polarization, enrichment and activation of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells, and inhibition of tumor growth in multiple syngeneic models. The anti-tumor activity of this TLR7/8 agonist is enhanced when combined with T cell-targeted immunotherapies in pre-clinical models. CONCLUSION: Localized TLR7/8 agonism can enhance recruitment and activation of immune cells in tumors and polarize anti-tumor immunity towards a Th1 response. Moreover, we demonstrate that the anti-tumor effects of this TLR7/8 agonist can be enhanced through combination with checkpoint inhibitors and co-stimulatory agonists."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The major challenge of antitumor immunotherapy is dealing with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which involves immature myeloid cell accumulation that results in T cell dysfunction. Myeloid cell activation is induced by Toll-like receptor agonists. Additionally, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promotes myelopoiesis and recruits myeloid cells. Here, we combined the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist lipoprotein and GM-CSF to assess whether this bifunctional immunotherapy has synergistic effects on myeloid cells and could be further developed as a therapeutic intervention that enhances the antitumor response. METHODS: We investigated the synergistic effects of biadjuvanted tumor antigen on antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, therapeutic efficacy was monitored in different tumor models treated via intratumoral or subcutaneous administration routes. The immune effects of the bifunctional fusion protein on myeloid cells in the tumor mass and draining lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes was evaluated via intracellular cytokine levels, perforin/granzyme B staining and an in vivo killing assay. RESULTS: The TLR2 agonist lipoprotein combined with GM-CSF synergistically induced DC maturation, which subsequently enhanced antitumor immunity. In addition, rlipoE7m-MoGM modulated tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell populations. Vaccination with rlipoE7m-MoGM therapy increased the number of CCR7+CD103+ cDC1s, whereas the number of suppressive tumor-associated macrophages was reduced in the tumor lesions. Consistent with this observation, proliferating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are highly infiltrated within the tumor, and the expression of IFN-r and perforin was most pronounced within antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice administered rlipoE7m-MoGM therapy. This finding corresponded with observation that the combination of a TLR2 agonist and GM-CSF provides increased antitumor activity by inhibiting established tumor outgrowth and protecting against metastatic cancer compared with a TLR2 agonist alone. Importantly, tumor growth inhibition was not due to the direct effects of the TLR2 agonist or GM-CSF but was instead due to the induction of antigen-specific immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a TLR2 agonist and GM-CSF has synergistic effects that inhibit tumor growth and modulate tumor-infiltrating APCs. This therapeutic approach could be applied to other tumor antigens to treat different cancers."

In situ vaccination of CMP-001 is believed to activate local tumor-associated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) leading to type I interferon secretion and tumor antigen presentation to T cells and systemic antitumor T cell responses. This study is designed to investigate if CMP-001 would enhance head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor response to anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy in a human papilloma virus-positive (HPV+) tumor mouse model. METHODS: Immune cell activation in response to CMP-001\u00b1anti-Q\u03b2 was performed using co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HPV+/HPV- HNSCC cells and then analyzed by flow cytometry. In situ vaccination with CMP-001 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 was investigated in C57BL/6 mice-bearing mEERL HNSCC tumors and analyzed for anti-Q\u03b2 development, antitumor response, survival and immune cell recruitment. The role of antitumor immune response due to CMP-001+anti-PD-1 treatment was investigated by the depletion of natural killer (NK), CD4+ T, and CD8+ T cells. RESULTS: Results showed that the activity of CMP-001 on immune cell (pDCs, monocytes, CD4+/CD8+ T cells and NK cells) activation depends on the presence of anti-Q\u03b2. A 2-week 'priming' period after subcutaneous administration of CMP-001 was required for robust anti-Q\u03b2 development in mice. In situ vaccination of CMP-001 was superior to unencapsulated G10 CpG-A ODN at suppressing both injected and uninjected (distant) tumors. In situ vaccination of CMP-001 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy induced durable tumor regression at injected and distant tumors and significantly prolonged mouse survival compared with anti-PD-1 therapy alone. The antitumor effect of CMP-001+anti-PD-1 was accompanied by increased interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3)+ CD4+/CD8+ T cells compared with control-treated mice. The therapeutic and abscopal effect of CMP-001+ anti-PD-1 therapy was completely abrogated by CD8+ T cell depletion. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that in situ vaccination with CMP-001 can induce both local and abscopal antitumor immune responses. Additionally, the antitumor efficacy of CMP-001 combined with \u03b1-PD-1 therapy warrants further study as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of HNSCC."

                "abstract": "Tumor vaccine has been one of the research hotspots for cancer immunotherapy in recent years. By introducing tumor antigens into the body, the patient's own immune system will be specifically activated to induce effective immune responses for controlling or eliminating the malignant tumor cells. In this study, a simple nanovaccine was developed to induce antigen-specific anti-tumor immune responses. Polycationic polyethylenimine (PEI) was utilized to co-deliver the antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the adjuvant unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) by electrostatic binding. The positively charged PEI could be beneficial to augment the PEI/CpG/OVA nanovaccine uptake in dendritic cells (DCs) and facilitate the endosomal escape of the nanovaccine for antigen delivering into the cytoplasm. The nanovaccine showed significant stimulation on DCs' maturation in\u00a0vitro, and it was further applied for in\u00a0vivo anti-tumor immunotherapy. To enhance the tumor infiltration of the nanovaccine-generated tumor-specific T cells, hyaluronidase (HAase) was employed to increase the permeability of the tumor tissues by breaking down the hyaluronan (HA) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumors. Highly enhanced in\u00a0vivo anti-tumor therapeutic efficiency was achieved by combining the PEI/CpG/OVA nanovaccine with HAase, which was attributed to the increased quantity of OVA-specific T cells in tumor tissues. The combination of nanovaccine with HAase has offered a simple and efficient strategy for inducing powerful anti-tumor effect in cancer immunotherapy."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although current immunotherapeutic strategies including adenovirus (AdV)-mediated gene therapy and dendritic cell (DC) vaccine can all stimulate antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CLT) responses, their therapeutic efficiency has still been limited to generation of prophylactic antitumor immunity against re-challenge with the parental tumor cells or growth inhibition of small tumors in vivo. However, it is the well-established tumors in animal models that mimic clinical patients with existing tumor burdens. Alpha tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) is a multifunctional and immunoregulatory cytokine that induces antitumor activity and activates immune cells such as DCs and T cells. We hypothesized that a combined immunotherapy including gene therapy and DC vaccine would have some advantages over each modality administered as a monotherapy. METHODS: We investigated the antitumor immunotherapeutic efficiency of gene therapy by intratumoral injection of AdVTNF-alpha and DC vaccine using subcutaneous injection of TNF-alpha-gene-engineered DC(TNF-alpha) cells, and further developed a combined AdV-mediated TNF-alpha-gene therapy and TNF-alpha-gene-engineered DC(TNF-alpha) vaccine in combating well-established MO4 tumors expressing the ovalbumin (OVA) gene in an animal model. RESULTS: Our data show that vaccination of DC(TNF-alpha) cells pulsed with the OVA I peptide can (i) stimulate type 1 immune response with enhanced antitumor CTL activities, (ii) induce protective immunity against challenge of 5 x 10(5) MO4 tumor cells, and (iii) reduce growth of the small (3-4 mm in diameter), but not large, established MO4 tumors (6-8 mm in diameter). Our data also show that AdVTNF-alpha-mediated gene therapy can completely eradicate small tumors in 6 out of 8 (75%) mice due to the extensive tumor necrosis formation, but not the large tumors (0%). Interestingly, a combined AdVTNF-alpha-mediated gene therapy and TNF-alpha-gene-engineered DC(TNF-alpha) vaccine is able to cure 3 out of 8 (38%) mice bearing large MO4 tumors, indicating that the combined immunotherapy strategy is much more efficient in combating well-established tumors than monotherapy of either gene therapy or DC vaccine alone. CONCLUSIONS: This novel combined immunotherapy may become a tool of considerable conceptual interest in the implementation of future clinical objectives."

                "abstract": "Among approaches of current cancer immunotherapy, a dendritic cell (DC)-targeted vaccine based on nanotechnology could be a promising way to efficiently induce potent immune responses. To enhance DC targeting and vaccine efficiency, we included imiquimod (IMQ), a toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR 7/8) agonist, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a TLR4 agonist, to synthesize lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles using PCL-PEG-PCL and DOTAP (IMNPs) as well as DSPE-PEG-mannose (MAN-IMNPS). The spatiotemporal delivery of MPLA (within the outer lipid layer) to extracellular TLR4 and IMQ (in the hydrophobic core of NPs) to intracellular TLR7/8 can activate DCs synergistically to improve vaccine efficacy. Ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen was readily absorbed by positively charged DOTAP and showed a quick release in vitro. Our results demonstrated that this novel nanovaccine enhanced cellular uptake, cytokine production, and maturation of DCs. Compared with the quick metabolism of free OVA-agonists, the depot effect of OVA-IMNPs was observed, whereas MAN-OVA-IMNPs promoted trafficking to secondary lymphoid organs. After immunization with a subcutaneous injection, the nanovaccine, especially MAN-OVA-IMNPs, induced more antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, greater lymphocyte activation, stronger cross-presentation, and more generation of memory T cells, antibody, IFN-\u03b3, and granzyme B. Prophylactic vaccination of MAN-OVA-IMNPs significantly delayed tumor development and prolonged the survival in mice. The therapeutic tumor challenge indicated that MAN-OVA-IMNPs prohibited tumor progression more efficiently than other formulations, and the combination with an immune checkpoint blockade further enhanced antitumor effects. Hence, the DC-targeted vaccine codelivery with IMQ and MPLA adjuvants by hybrid cationic nanoparticles in a spatiotemporal manner is a promising multifunctional antigen delivery system in cancer immunotherapy."

We hypothesized that by rigorously restricting the biodistribution of immunotherapeutic agents to a locally accessible lesion and draining lymph node(s), effective local and systemic antitumor immunity could be achieved in the absence of systemic toxicity. We anchored anti-CD137 and an engineered IL-2Fc fusion protein to the surfaces of PEGylated liposomes, whose physical size permitted dissemination in the tumor parenchyma and tumor-draining lymph nodes but blocked entry into the systemic circulation following intratumoral injection. In the B16F10 melanoma model, intratumoral liposome-coupled anti-CD137 + IL-2Fc therapy cured a majority of established primary tumors while avoiding the lethal inflammatory toxicities caused by equivalent intratumoral doses of soluble immunotherapy. Immunoliposome therapy induced protective antitumor memory and elicited systemic antitumor immunity that significantly inhibited the growth of simultaneously established distal tumors. Tumor inhibition was CD8(+) T-cell-dependent and was associated with increased CD8(+) T-cell infiltration in both treated and distal tumors, enhanced activation of tumor antigen-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes, and a reduction in regulatory T cells in treated tumors. These data suggest that local nanoparticle-anchored delivery of immuno-agonists represents a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic window and clinical applicability of highly potent but otherwise intolerable regimens of cancer immunotherapy.

A major challenge in achieving a robust T-cell response is the spatiotemporal orchestration of antigen cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells with innate stimulation. Here, we report a minimalist nanovaccine, comprising a simple physical mixture of an antigen and a synthetic polymeric nanoparticle, PC7A NP, which generates a strong cytotoxic T-cell response with low systemic cytokine expression. Mechanistically, the PC7A NP achieves efficient cytosolic delivery of tumour antigens to antigen-presenting cells in draining lymph nodes, leading to increased surface presentation while simultaneously activating type I interferon-stimulated genes. This effect is dependent on stimulator of interferon genes (STING), but not the Toll-like receptor or the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) pathway. The nanovaccine led to potent tumour growth inhibition in melanoma, colon cancer and human papilloma virus-E6/E7 tumour models. The combination of the PC7A nanovaccine and an anti-PD-1 antibody showed great synergy, with 100% survival over 60 days in a TC-1 tumour model. Rechallenging of these tumour-free animals with TC-1 cells led to complete inhibition of tumour growth, suggesting the generation of long-term antitumour memory. The STING-activating nanovaccine offers a simple, safe and robust strategy in boosting anti-tumour immunity for cancer immunotherapy."

Immunization with cancer vaccines composed of tumor cell lysates (TCL) can induce an effective antitumor immune response. However, this approach also has the disadvantages of inefficient antigen delivery to the tumor tissues and the limited immune response elicited by single-antigen vaccines. To overcome these limitations, a pH-sensitive nanocalcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) carrier loaded with TCL and immune adjuvant CpG (CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826) is herein constructed for TNBC immunotherapy. This tailor-made nanovaccine, termed CaCO3 @TCL/CpG, not only neutralizes the acidic TME through the consumption of lactate by CaCO3 , which increases the proportion of the M1/M2 macrophages and promotes infiltration of effector immune cells but also activates the dendritic cells in the tumor tissues and recruits cytotoxic T cells to further kill the tumor cells. In vivo fluorescence imaging study shows that the pegylated nanovaccine could stay longer in the blood circulation and extravasate preferentially into tumor site. Besides, the nanovaccine exhibits high cytotoxicity in 4T1 cells and significantly inhibits tumor growth of tumor-bearing mice. Overall, this pH-sensitive nanovaccine is a promising nanoplatform for enhanced immunotherapy of TNBC."

Agonist antibodies directed to costimulatory receptor CD137 (4-1BB) strongly amplify pre-existing cellular immune responses toward weak tumor antigens. In this study, we provide evidence for powerful synergistic effects of a combined strategy consisting of intratumoral injection of SFV-IL-12 and systemic delivery of agonist anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which was substantiated against poorly immunogenic B16 melanomas (B16-OVA and B16.F10) and TC-1 lung carcinomas. Effector CD8(\u03b2)(+) T cells were sufficient to mediate complete tumor eradications. Accordingly, there was an intensely synergistic in vivo enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)-mediated immunity against the tumor antigens OVA and tyrosine-related protein-2 (TRP-2). This train of phenomena led to long-lasting tumor-specific immunity against rechallenge, attained transient control of the progression of concomitant tumor lesions that were not directly treated with SFV-IL-12 and caused autoimmune vitiligo. Importantly, we found that SFV-IL-12 intratumoral injection induces bright expression of CD137 on most tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes, thereby providing more abundant targets for the action of the agonist antibody. This efficacious combinatorial immunotherapy strategy offers feasibility for clinical translation since anti-CD137 mAbs are already undergoing clinical trials and development of clinical-grade SFV-IL-12 vectors is in progress."

Targeting \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) signaling exerts promising benefits on reversing the suppressive effects directly on T cells, but it appears to have considerably limited antitumor performance when combined with vaccine-based immunotherapies. Herein, a tumor membrane-coated nanoplatform for codelivery of adjuvant CpG and propranolol (Pro), a \u03b2-AR inhibitor is designed. The biomimetic nanovaccine displayed an improved accumulation in lymph nodes and sufficient drug release, thereby inducing dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation. Meanwhile, the integration of vaccination and blockade of \u03b2-AR signaling not only promoted the priming of the naive CD8+ T cells and effector T cell egress from lymph nodes, but also alleviated the immunosuppressive TME by decreasing the frequency of immunosuppressive cells and increasing the tumor infiltration of B cells and NK cells. Consequently, the biomimetic nanovaccines outperformed greater prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy than nanovaccines without Pro encapsulation in B16-F10 melanoma mice. Taken together, the work explored a biomimetic nanovaccine for priming tumor infiltration of T cells and immunosuppressive TME regulation, offering tremendous potential for a combined \u03b2-AR signaling-targeting strategy in cancer immunotherapy."

                "abstract": "Nanovaccine-based immunotherapy (NBI) has the ability to initiate dendritic cell (DC)-mediated tumor-specific immune responses and maintain long-term antitumor immune memory. To date, the mechanism by which the mechanical properties of nanoparticles alter the functions of DCs in NBI remains largely unclear. Here, a soft mesoporous organosilica-based nanovaccine (SMONV) is prepared and the elasticity-dependent effect of the nanovaccine on the underlying DC-mediated immune responses is studied. It is found that the elasticity results in greater internalization of SMONV by DCs, followed by the induction of substantial cytosolic delivery of antigens via endosomal escape, leading to effective DC maturation and antigen cross-presentation. Impressively, elasticity enables SMONV to enhance lymphatic drainage of antigens in vivo, thus stimulating robust humoral and cellular immunity. The results from therapeutic tumor vaccination further reveal that subcutaneously administered SMONV effectively suppresses tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice by evoking antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses, mitigating regulatory T-cell-mediated immunosuppression, and increasing central memory and effector memory T-cell populations. Furthermore, combinatorial immunization with SMONV and anti-PD-L1 blocking antibodies results in an amplified therapeutic effect on tumor-bearing mice. These findings reveal the elastic effect of the nanovaccine on DC-mediated immune responses, and the prepared SMONV represents a facile and powerful strategy for antitumor immunotherapy."

Bone marrow hematopoiesis replenishes the exhausted peripheral leukocyte pools. However, it is not known whether brain injury influences the development of bone marrow lineages and how altered hematopoietic cell lineages affect neurological outcome. Here, we showed that bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be swiftly skewed toward the myeloid lineage in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and experimental ICH models. Lineage tracing revealed a predominantly augmented hematopoiesis of Ly6Clow monocytes infiltrating the ICH brain, where they generated alternatively activated macrophages and suppressed neuroinflammation and brain injury. The ICH brain uses \u03b23-adrenergic innervation that involves cell division cycle 42 to promote bone marrow hematopoiesis of Ly6Clow monocytes, which could be further potentiated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved \u03b23-adrenergic agonist mirabegron.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In multiple sclerosis, inflammation can successfully be prevented, while promoting repair is still a major challenge. Microglial cells, the resident phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), are hematopoietic-derived myeloid cells and express the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), an innate immune receptor. Myeloid cells are an accessible source for ex vivo gene therapy. We investigated whether myeloid precursor cells genetically modified to express TREM2 affect the disease course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: EAE was induced in mice by immunization with a myelin autoantigen. Intravenous application of TREM2-transduced bone marrow-derived myeloid precursor cells at the EAE peak led to an amelioration of clinical symptoms, reduction in axonal damage, and prevention of further demyelination. TREM2-transduced myeloid cells applied intravenously migrated into the inflammatory spinal cord lesions of EAE-diseased mice, showed increased lysosomal and phagocytic activity, cleared degenerated myelin, and created an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu within the CNS. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenously applied bone marrow-derived and TREM2-tranduced myeloid precursor cells limit tissue destruction and facilitate repair within the murine CNS by clearance of cellular debris during EAE. TREM2 is a new attractive target for promotion of repair and resolution of inflammation in multiple sclerosis and other neuroinflammatory diseases."

The mechanism by which these cells are replenished during relapsing and chronic neuroinflammation is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that CD11b(+)CD62L(+)Ly6C(hi) monocytes with colony-forming potential are mobilized into the bloodstream by a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent pathway immediately before EAE relapses. Circulating Ly6C(hi) monocytes traffic across the blood-brain barrier, up-regulate proinflammatory molecules, and differentiate into central nervous system dendritic cells and macrophages. Enrichment of Ly6C(hi) monocytes in the circulating pool is associated with an earlier onset and increased severity of clinical EAE. Our studies indicate that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-driven release of Ly6C(hi) precursors from the bone marrow prevents exhaustion of central nervous system myeloid populations during relapsing or chronic autoimmune demyelination, suggesting a novel pathway for therapeutic targeting."

                "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs)--although absent from the healthy CNS parenchyma--rapidly accumulate within brain and spinal cord tissue during neuroinflammation associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis). Yet, although DCs have been appreciated for their role in initiating adaptive immune responses in peripheral lymphoid organ tissues, how DCs infiltrate the CNS and contribute to ongoing neuroinflammation in situ is poorly understood. In this study, we report the following: 1) CD11c(+) bone marrow-derived DCs and CNS-infiltrating DCs express chemokine receptor CCR2; 2) compared with CCR2(+/+) cells, adoptively transferred CCR2(-/-) bone marrow-derived DCs or DC precursors do not accumulate in the CNS during EAE, despite abundance in blood; 3) CCR2(-/-) DCs show less accumulation in the inflamed CNS in mixed bone marrow chimeras, when compared with CCR2(+/+) DCs; and 4) ablation of CCR2(+/+) DCs during EAE clinical onset delays progression and attenuates cytokine production by infiltrating T cells. Whereas the role of CCR2 in monocyte migration into the CNS has been implicated previously, the role of CCR2 in DC infiltration into the CNS has never been directly addressed. Our data suggest that CCR2-dependent DC recruitment to the CNS during ongoing neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in effector T cell cytokine production and disease progression, and signify that CNS-DCs and circulating DC precursors might be key therapeutic targets for suppressing ongoing neuroinflammation in CNS autoimmune diseases."

In MS, encephalitogenic T cells infiltrate the CNS causing demyelination and neuroinflammation; however, little is known about the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CNS tissue repair. Transplantation of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs and NPCs) is a promising therapeutic strategy to promote repair through cell replacement, although recent findings suggest transplanted NSCs also instruct endogenous repair mechanisms. We have recently described that dampened neuroinflammation and increased remyelination is correlated with emergence of Tregs following human NPC transplantation in a murine viral model of immune-mediated demyelination. In the current study we utilized the prototypic murine autoimmune model of demyelination experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to test the efficacy of hNSC transplantation. Eight-week-old, male EAE mice receiving an intraspinal transplant of hNSCs during the chronic phase of disease displayed remyelination, dampened neuroinflammation, and an increase in CNS CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Importantly, ablation of Tregs abrogated histopathological improvement. Tregs are essential for maintenance of T cell homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity, and an emerging role for Tregs in maintenance of tissue homeostasis through interactions with stem and progenitor cells has recently been suggested. The data presented here provide direct evidence for collaboration between CNS Tregs and hNSCs promoting remyelination."

However, the formation of inflammatory CNS lesions and the contribution of different leukocyte subsets in setting up these lesions are still incompletely understood. In this study, we show that, in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, neutrophil granulocytes are important contributors in preparing CNS inflammation. Preclinical single-dose Ab-mediated depletion of neutrophils delayed the onset and continuous depletion attenuated the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas the generation of a myelin-specific T cell response remained unaffected. Neutrophil-related enzymes such as myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase did not contribute in mounting CNS inflammation, as analyzed by using respective knockout mice and inhibitors. CNS-infiltrating neutrophils secreted proinflammatory molecules and matured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro, which in turn enhanced their ability to restimulate myelin-specific T cells. This was mirrored in vivo, in which depletion of neutrophils specifically impaired maturation of microglia and macrophages into professional APCs, resulting in a diminished amplification of early CNS inflammation. Therefore, inside the CNS neutrophils provide local cofactors that are required for the maturation of myeloid cells into professional APCs representing an essential step for the local restimulation of myelin-specific T cells and the development of autoimmune disease.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can suppress inflammatory disease in a majority of patients with MS but retards clinical progression only in patients treated in the early stages of the disease. Here, we applied BMT in a mouse model of neuroinflammation, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and investigated the kinetics of reconstitution of the immune system in the periphery and in the CNS using bone marrow cells isolated from syngeneic donors constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein. This approach allowed us to dissect the contribution of donor cells to the turnover of resident microglia and to the pathogenesis of observed disease relapses after BMT. BMT effectively blocked or delayed EAE development when mice were treated early in the course of the disease but was without effect in mice with chronic disease. We found that there is minimal overall replacement of host microglia with donor cells in the CNS and that newly transplanted cells do not appear to contribute to disease progression. In contrast, EAE relapses are accompanied by the robust activation of endogenous microglial and macroglial cells, which further involves the maturation of endogenous Olig2 glial progenitor cells into reactive astrocytes through the cytoplasmic translocation of Olig2 and the expression of CD44 on the cellular membrane. The observed maturation of large numbers of reactive astrocytes from glial progenitors and the chronic activation of host microglial cells have relevance for our understanding of the resident glial response to inflammatory injury in the CNS. Our data indicate that reactivation of a local inflammatory process after BMT is sustained predominantly by endogenous microglia/macrophages."

Dysregulation of STAT3, a transcription factor pivotal to various cellular processes including Th17 cell differentiation, has been implicated in MS.

Genetic disruption of Stat3 in peripheral myeloid lineage cells abrogated EAE, which was associated with decreased antigen-specific T helper cell responses. Myeloid cells from immunized Stat3 mutant mice exhibited impaired antigen-presenting functions and were ineffective in driving encephalitogenic T cell differentiation. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of myeloid lineage cells from preclinical wild-type and mutant mice revealed that loss of myeloid STAT3 signaling disrupted antigen-dependent cross-activation of myeloid cells and T helper cells. This study identifies a previously unrecognized requisite for myeloid cell STAT3 in the activation of myelin-reactive T cells and suggests myeloid STAT3 as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune demyelinating disease."

                "abstract": "Emergency myelopoiesis is inflammation-induced hematopoiesis to replenish myeloid cells in the periphery, which is critical to control the infection with pathogens. Previously, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were demonstrated to play a critical role in the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors, leading to production of mature myeloid cells, although their inhibitory effects on hematopoiesis were also reported. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of emergency myelopoiesis during infection remains incompletely understood. Here, we clarify that one of the interleukin (IL)-6/IL-12 family cytokines, IL-27, plays an important role in the emergency myelopoiesis. Among various types of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, IL-27 predominantly and continuously promoted the expansion of only Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, especially long-term repopulating HSCs and myeloid-restricted progenitor cells with long-term repopulating activity, and the differentiation into myeloid progenitors in synergy with stem cell factor. These progenitors expressed myeloid transcription factors such as Spi1, Gfi1, and Cebpa/b through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3, and had enhanced potential to differentiate into migratory dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and mast cells, and less so into macrophages, and basophils, but not into plasmacytoid DCs, conventional DCs, T cells, and B cells. Among various cytokines, IL-27 in synergy with the stem cell factor had the strongest ability to augment the expansion of LSK cells and their differentiation into myeloid progenitors retaining the LSK phenotype over a long period of time. The experiments using mice deficient for one of IL-27 receptor subunits, WSX-1, and IFN-\u03b3 revealed that the blood stage of malaria infection enhanced IL-27 expression through IFN-\u03b3 production, and the IL-27 then promoted the expansion of LSK cells, differentiating and mobilizing them into spleen, resulting in enhanced production of neutrophils to control the infection. Thus, IL-27 is one of the limited unique cytokines directly acting on HSCs to promote differentiation into myeloid progenitors during emergency myelopoiesis. "

We have demonstrated previously that expression by the host cells of the heat-stable antigen (CD24), which was recently identified as a genetic modifier for MS, is essential for their susceptibility to EAE. Here we show that CD24 is essential for local clonal expansion and persistence of T cells after their migration into the CNS, and that expression of CD24 on either hematopoietic cells or nonhematopoietic antigen-presenting cells in the recipient is sufficient to confer susceptibility to EAE."

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice leads to activation of hematopoietic bone marrow stem cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial in vivo bioluminescence reporter gene imaging in mice with tMCAO revealed that bone marrow cell cycling peaked 4 days after stroke (P<0.05 versus pre tMCAO). Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis showed activation of the entire hematopoietic tree, including myeloid progenitors. The cycling fraction of the most upstream hematopoietic stem cells increased from 3.34%\u00b10.19% to 7.32%\u00b10.52% after tMCAO (P<0.05). In vivo microscopy corroborated proliferation of adoptively transferred hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow of mice with stroke. The hematopoietic system's myeloid bias was reflected by increased expression of myeloid transcription factors, including PU.1 (P<0.05), and by a decline in lymphocyte precursors. In mice after tMCAO, tyrosine hydroxylase levels in sympathetic fibers and bone marrow noradrenaline levels rose (P<0.05, respectively), associated with a decrease of hematopoietic niche factors that promote stem cell quiescence. In mice with genetic deficiency of the \u03b23 adrenergic receptor, hematopoietic stem cells did not enter the cell cycle in increased numbers after tMCAO (naive control, 3.23\u00b10.22; tMCAO, 3.74\u00b10.33, P=0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic stroke activates hematopoietic stem cells via increased sympathetic tone, leading to a myeloid bias of hematopoiesis and higher bone marrow output of inflammatory Ly6C(high) monocytes and neutrophils."

Disease pathogenesis is primarily due to T-cell-mediated destruction of myelin, which has been attributed to cytopathic effects of the virus, but immune-mediated destruction of myelin mediated via both virus-specific and myelin-specific T cells appear to play the major role. To determine if bone marrow transplantation would be an effective therapy for a virus-initiated autoimmune disease and to better separate viral cytopathic effects from immune-mediated demyelination, we ablated the immune system of TMEV-infected animals with 1,100 cGy total body irradiation, and then the animal's immunity was reconstituted by transplantation of disease-susceptible SJL/J mice with syngeneic marrow or disease-susceptible DBA/2J with marrow from disease-resistant (C57Bl/6 x DBA/2)F1 (B6D2) donors. Hematopoietic transplant performed after onset of disease resulted in 42% mortality in SJL/J syngeneic transplants, 47% mortality in diseased DBA2 recipients restored with marrow from naive B6D2 donors, and 12% in diseased DBA2 recipients receiving marrow from B6D2 donors previously infected with TMEV. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to both virion and myelin proteins was decreased in surviving mice that underwent transplantation; however, CNS viral titers were significantly elevated compared with nontransplanted controls. We conclude that a functional immune system with appropriate T-cell responses are important in prevention of lethal cytopathic CNS effects from TMEV. Relevant to the clinical use of bone marrow transplantation, attempts to ablate the immune system in viral-mediated immune diseases or virus-initiated autoimmune disease may have acute and lethal consequences. Our results raise concern about the attempted use of autologous hematopoietic transplantation in patients with MS, an autoimmune disease with a suspected virus etiology, particularly if the graft is aggressively depleted of lymphocytes."

IL7R\u03b1 has well documented roles in lymphocyte development and homeostasis, but its involvement in disease is largely understudied. In this study, we use the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS to show that a less severe form of the disease results when IL7R\u03b1 expression is largely restricted to thymic tissue in IL7RTg(IL7R-/-) mice. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, IL7RTg(IL7R-/-) mice exhibited reduced paralysis and myelin damage that correlated with dampened effector responses, namely decreased TNF production. Furthermore, treatment of diseased WT mice with neutralizing anti-IL7R\u03b1 Ab also resulted in significant improvement of EAE. In addition, chimeric mice were generated by bone marrow transplant to limit expression of IL7R\u03b1 to cells of either hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic origin. Mice lacking IL7R\u03b1 only on hematopoietic cells develop severe EAE, suggesting that IL7R\u03b1 expression in the nonhematopoietic compartment contributes to disease. Moreover, novel IL7R\u03b1 expression was identified on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes endogenous to the CNS. Chimeric mice that lack IL7R\u03b1 only on nonhematopoietic cells also develop severe EAE, which further supports the role of IL7R\u03b1 in T cell effector function. Conversely, mice that lack IL7R\u03b1 throughout both compartments are dramatically protected from disease. Taken together, these data indicate that multiple cell types use IL7R\u03b1 signaling in the development of EAE, and inhibition of this pathway should be considered as a new therapeutic avenue for MS."

                "abstract": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell-mediated inflammatory autoimmune disease model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The inflammatory process is initiated by activation and proliferation of T cells and monocytes and by their subsequent migration into the central nervous system (CNS), where they induce demyelination and neurodegeneration. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) - synthesized by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) - has both pro- and anti-inflammatory potential, which is translated via four different EP receptors. We hypothesized that PGE2 synthesized in the preclinical phase by peripheral immune cells exerts pro-inflammatory properties in the EAE model. To investigate this, we used a bone marrow transplantation model, which enables PGE2 synthesis or EP receptor expression to be blocked specifically in peripheral murine immune cells. Our results reveal that deletion of COX-2 or its EP4 receptor in bone marrow-derived cells leads to a significant delay in the onset of EAE. This effect is due to an impaired preclinical inflammatory process indicated by a reduced level of the T cell activating interleukin-6 (IL-6), reduced numbers of T cells and of the T cell secreted interleukin-17 (IL-17) in the blood of mice lacking COX-2 or EP4 in peripheral immune cells. Moreover, mice lacking COX-2 or EP4 in bone marrow-derived cells show a reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which results in decreased infiltration of monocytes and T cells into the CNS. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PGE2 synthesized by monocytes in the early preclinical phase promotes the development of EAE in an EP4 receptor dependent manner. "

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the animal model widely utilized to study MS. EAE is mediated by CD4(+) T cells and can be induced in EAE-susceptible mice through immunization with a myelin antigen, such as proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP139-151) in SJL mice. In this PLP-induced EAE model, autoreactive CD4(+) T cells migrate from peripheral tissues into the CNS where they are reactivated resulting in CNS damage. Th1 and Th17 cells produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and IL-17, respectively, that have been shown to have pathogenic roles in EAE and MS. Anti-inflammatory Th2, IL-4 secreting cells, have been indicated to inhibit EAE exacerbation. However, given the inflammatory environment of EAE, Th2 effector cells are outnumbered by Th1/Th17 cells. Regulatory CD4(+) T cells suppress immune reactions and have been demonstrated to be dysfunctional in MS patients. Opioid growth factor (OGF), chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, is a negative growth factor that interacts with the OGF receptor. The OGF-OGFr axis can be activated through exogenous administration of OGF or a low dosage of naltrexone (LDN), an opioid antagonist. We have previously demonstrated that modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis results in alleviation from relapse-remitting EAE, and that CNS-infiltrating CD3(+) T cells are diminished with exogenous OGF or intermittent blockade with LDN administration. In this paper, we aimed to determine whether OGF or LDN alter the Th effector responses of CD4(+) T lymphocytes within the CNS in established EAE. We report in these studies that the numbers of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in the CNS of EAE mice are decreased following treatment with OGF for five days but not LDN. However, modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis did not result in changes to CD4(+) Th effector cell responses in the CNS of EAE mice. "

During ageing, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that produce immune cells are thought to decline in their regenerative capacity. However, HSPC function has been mostly assessed using transplantation assays, and it remains unclear how HSPCs age in the native bone marrow niche. To address this issue, we present an in situ single cell lineage tracing technology to quantify the clonal composition and cell production of single cells in their native niche. Our results demonstrate that a pool of HSPCs with unequal output maintains myelopoiesis through overlapping waves of cell production throughout adult life. During ageing, the increased frequency of myeloid cells is explained by greater numbers of HSPCs contributing to myelopoiesis rather than the increased myeloid output of individual HSPCs. Strikingly, the myeloid output of HSPCs remains constant over time despite accumulating significant transcriptomic changes throughout adulthood. Together, these results show that, unlike emergency myelopoiesis post-transplantation, aged HSPCs in their native microenvironment do not functionally decline in their regenerative capacity."

Although strategies to promote myelin repair are eagerly sought, mechanisms underlying remyelination in vivo have been elusive. CXCR2 is expressed on neutrophils and oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the CNS. CXCR2-positive neutrophils facilitate inflammatory demyelination in demyelination models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone intoxication. Systemic injection of a small molecule CXCR2 antagonist at the onset of EAE decreased demyelinated lesions. These results left the cellular target of the CXCR2 antagonist uncertain and did not clarify whether CXCR2 blockade prevented demyelination or promoted remyelination. Here, we show that the actions of CXCR2 on nonhematopoietic cells unexpectedly delay myelin repair. Bone marrow chimeric mice (Cxcr2(+/-)-->Cxcr2(-/-) and Cxcr2(+/-)-->Cxcr2(+/+)) were subjected to two distinct models of myelin injury. In all cases, myelin repair was more efficient in Cxcr2(+/-)-->Cxcr2(-/-) animals. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in demyelinated lesions of Cxcr2(+/-)-->Cxcr2(-/-) mice proliferated earlier and more vigorously than in tissues from Cxcr2(+/-)--> Cxcr2(+/+) animals. In vitro demyelinated CNS slice cultures also showed better myelin repair when CXCR2 was blocked with neutralizing antibodies or was genetically deleted. Our results suggest that CXCR2 inactivation permits optimal spatiotemporal positioning of OPCs in demyelinating lesions to receive local proliferative and differentiating signals. Given that CXCR2 exerts dual functions that promote demyelination and decrease remyelination by actions toward hematopoietic cells and nonhematopoietic cells, respectively, our findings identify CXCR2 as a promising drug target for clinical demyelinating disorders."

Here, we provide the first evidence that CNS-reactive antibodies (Ab) are similarly capable of initiating an encephalitogenic immune response by targeting endogenous CNS antigen to otherwise inert myeloid APC. In a transgenic mouse model, constitutive production of Ab against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was sufficient to promote spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the absence of B cells, when mice endogenously contained MOG-recognizing T cells. Adoptive transfer studies corroborated that anti-MOG Ab triggered activation and expansion of peripheral MOG-specific T cells in an Fc-dependent manner, subsequently causing EAE. To evaluate the underlying mechanism, anti-MOG Ab were added to a co-culture of myeloid APC and MOG-specific T cells. At otherwise undetected concentrations, anti-MOG Ab enabled Fc-mediated APC recognition of intact MOG; internalized, processed and presented MOG activated na\u00efve T cells to differentiate in an encephalitogenic manner. In a series of translational experiments, anti-MOG Ab from two patients with an acute flare of CNS inflammation likewise facilitated detection of human MOG. Jointly, these observations highlight Ab-mediated opsonization of endogenous CNS auto-antigen as a novel disease- and/or relapse-triggering mechanism in CNS demyelinating disorders."

                "abstract": "The suppressive effect of neural stem cells (NSCs) on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), has been reported. However, the migration of NSCs to inflammatory sites was relatively slow as was the onset of rather limited clinical benefit. Lack of, or low expression of particular chemokine receptors on NSCs could be an important factor underlying the slow migration of NSCs. To enhance the therapeutic effect of NSCs, in the present study we transduced bone marrow (BM)-derived NSCs with CCR5, a receptor for CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, chemokines that are abundantly produced in CNS-inflamed foci of MS/EAE. After i.v. injection, CCR5-NSCs rapidly reached EAE foci in larger numbers, and more effectively suppressed CNS inflammatory infiltration, myelin damage, and clinical EAE than GFP-NSCs used as controls. CCR5-NSC-treated mice also exhibited augmented remyelination and neuron/oligodendrocyte repopulation compared to PBS- or GFP-NSC-treated mice. We inferred that the critical mechanism underlying enhanced effect of CCR5-transduced NSCs on EAE is the early migration of chemokine receptor-transduced NSCs into the inflamed foci. Such migration at an earlier stage of inflammation enables NSCs to exert more effective immunomodulation, to reduce the extent of early myelin/neuron damage by creating a less hostile environment for remyelinating cells, and possibly to participate in the remyelination/neural repopulation process. These features of BM-derived transduced NSCs, combined with their easy availability (the subject's own BM) and autologous properties, may lay the groundwork for an innovative approach to rapid and highly effective MS therapy."

                "abstract": "The unmet medical need of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is the inexorable loss of CNS myelin and latterly neurons leading to permanent neurologic disability. Solicitation of endogenous oligodendrocytes progenitor cells, the precursor of oligodendrocytes, to remyelinate axons may abort the onset of disability. In female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS, adoptive transfer of IL-10+ regulatory B cells (Bregs) has been shown to reverse EAE by promoting the expansion of peripheral and CNS-infiltrating IL-10+ T cells. Here, we examined whether Bregs treatment and its bystander effect on regulatory T cells are associated with CNS repair as reflected by oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. We have found that transfusion of Bregs reverses established clinical EAE and that clinical improvement is associated with a significant increase in spinal cord remyelination as reflected by g-ratio analysis within the thoracic and lumbar spine. We further observed in the spinal cords of EAE Bregs-treated mice that CNS resident CD11b/CD45intLy6C- microglia, and infiltrating CD11b+/CD45high monocytes/macrophages content reverts to normal and polarize to a M2-like CD206+ phenotype. Concurrently, there was a substantial increase in neo-oligodendrogenesis as manifest by an increase in CD45-/low CNS cells expressing A2B5, an early marker in oligodendrocytes progenitor cell differentiation as well as GalC+/O1+ premyelinating and myelin basic protein+/myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein+ mature oligodendrocytes with reciprocal downregulation of paired related homeobox protein 1. These results demonstrate that the clinical benefit of Bregs is associated with normalization of CNS immune milieu and concurrent activation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells with subsequent remyelination.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In multiple sclerosis patients, demyelination progresses with aging and disease course, leading to irreversible disability. In this study, we have discovered, using a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, that the transfusion of autologous regulatory B cells (Bregs) is able to ameliorate, cure, and sustain the durable remission of the disease. We show that the adoptive transfer of Bregs dramatically decreased the frequency of myeloid-derived cells, both infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and resident microglia, and converted their phenotype to an immunosuppressive-like phenotype. Moreover, we showed that CNS oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are activated following Bregs treatment and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes, which results in neo-oligodendrogenesis and remyelination of spinal cords."

            "abstract": "VLCFAs (very-long-chain fatty acids) are the most abundant fatty acids in myelin. Hence, during demyelination or aging, glia are exposed to higher levels of VLCFA than normal. We report that glia convert these VLCFA into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) via a glial-specific S1P pathway. Excess S1P causes neuroinflammation, NF-\u03baB activation, and macrophage infiltration into the CNS. Suppressing the function of S1P in fly glia or neurons, or administration of Fingolimod, an S1P receptor antagonist, strongly attenuates the phenotypes caused by excess VLCFAs. In contrast, elevating the VLCFA levels in glia and immune cells exacerbates these phenotypes. Elevated VLCFA and S1P are also toxic in vertebrates based on a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Indeed, reducing VLCFA with bezafibrate ameliorates the phenotypes. Moreover, simultaneous use of bezafibrate and fingolimod synergizes to improve EAE, suggesting that lowering VLCFA and S1P is a treatment avenue for MS."

                "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lysophospholipid, has gained relevance to multiple sclerosis through the discovery of FTY720 (fingolimod), recently approved as an oral treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Its mechanism of action is thought to be immunological through an active phosphorylated metabolite, FTY720-P, that resembles S1P and alters lymphocyte trafficking through receptor subtype S1P(1). However, previously reported expression and in vitro studies of S1P receptors suggested that direct CNS effects of FTY720 might theoretically occur through receptor modulation on neurons and glia. To identify CNS cells functionally contributing to FTY720 activity, genetic approaches were combined with cellular and molecular analyses. These studies relied on the functional assessment, based on clinical score, of conditional null mouse mutants lacking S1P(1) in CNS cell lineages and challenged by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. All conditional null mutants displayed WT lymphocyte trafficking that responded normally to FTY720. In marked contrast, EAE was attenuated and FTY720 efficacy was lost in CNS mutants lacking S1P(1) on GFAP-expressing astrocytes but not on neurons. In situ hybridization studies confirmed that astrocyte loss of S1P(1) was the key alteration in functionally affected mutants. Reductions in EAE clinical scores were paralleled by reductions in demyelination, axonal loss, and astrogliosis. Receptor rescue and pharmacological experiments supported the loss of S1P(1) on astrocytes through functional antagonism by FTY720-P as a primary FTY720 mechanism. These data identify nonimmunological CNS mechanisms of FTY720 efficacy and implicate S1P signaling pathways within the CNS as targets for multiple sclerosis therapies."

                "title": "Fingolimod modulates microglial activation to augment markers of remyelination.",
                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Microglial activation in multiple sclerosis has been postulated to contribute to long-term neurodegeneration during disease. Fingolimod has been shown to impact on the relapsing remitting phase of disease by modulating autoreactive T-cell egress from lymph organs. In addition, it is brain penetrant and has been shown to exert multiple effects on nervous system cells. METHODS: In this study, the impact of fingolimod and other sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor active molecules following lysophosphotidyl choline-induced demyelination was examined in the rat telencephalon reaggregate, spheroid cell culture system. The lack of immune system components allowed elucidation of the direct effects of fingolimod on CNS cell types in an organotypic situation. RESULTS: Following demyelination, fingolimod significantly augmented expression of myelin basic protein in the remyelination phase. This increase was not associated with changes in neurofilament levels, indicating de novo myelin protein expression not associated with axonal branching. Myelin wrapping was confirmed morphologically using confocal and electron microscopy. Increased remyelination was associated with down-regulation of microglial ferritin, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 during demyelination when fingolimod was present. In addition, nitric oxide metabolites and apoptotic effectors caspase 3 and caspase 7 were reduced during demyelination in the presence of fingolimod. The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5 agonist BAF312 also increased myelin basic protein levels, whereas the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 agonist AUY954 failed to replicate this effect on remyelination. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented indicate that modulation of S1P receptors can ameliorate pathological effectors associated with microglial activation leading to a subsequent increase in protein and morphological markers of remyelination. In addition, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5 is implicated in promoting remyelination in vitro. This knowledge may be of benefit for treatment of chronic microglial inflammation in multiple sclerosis."

                "abstract": "FTY720 (fingolimod) is an oral sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator in phase III development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. To further investigate its mode of action, we analyzed gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). FTY720 downregulated inflammatory genes in addition to vascular adhesion molecules. It decreased the matrix metalloproteinase gene MMP-9 and increased its counterregulator--tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, TIMP-1--resulting in a proteolytic balance that favors preservation of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity. Furthermore, FTY720 reduced S1P lyase that increases the S1P concentration in the brain, in line with a marked reversal of neurological deficits and raising the possibility for enhanced triggering of S1P receptors on resident brain cells. This is accompanied by an increase in S1P(1) and S1P(5) in contrast with the attenuation of S1P(3) and S1P(4). Late-stage rescue therapy with FTY720, even up to 1 month after EAE onset, reversed BBB leakiness and reduced demyelination, along with normalization of neurologic function. Our results indicate rapid blockade of ongoing disease processes by FTY720, and structural restoration of the CNS parenchyma, which is likely caused by the inhibition of autoimmune T cell infiltration and direct modulation of microvascular and/or glial cells."

                "abstract": "Fingolimod (FTY720) is a first-in-class orally bioavailable compound that has shown efficacy in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). In vivo, fingolimod is phosphorylated to form fingolimod-phosphate, which resembles naturally occurring sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), an extracellular lipid mediator whose major effects are mediated by cognate G protein-coupled receptors. There are at least 5 S1P receptor subtypes, known as S1P subtypes 1-5 (S1P1-5), 4 of which bind fingolimod-phosphate. These receptors are expressed on a wide range of cells that are involved in many biological processes relevant to MS. S1P1 plays a key role in the immune system, regulating lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues into the circulation. Fingolimod-phosphate initially activates lymphocyte S1P1 via high-affinity receptor binding yet subsequently induces S1P1 down-regulation that prevents lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues, thereby reducing autoaggressive lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). S1P receptors are also expressed by many CNS cell types and have been shown to influence cell proliferation, morphology, and migration. Fingolimod crosses the blood-brain barrier and may therefore have direct CNS effects, distinguishing it from immunologically targeted MS therapies. Prophylactic administration of fingolimod to animals with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a model of MS, completely prevents development of EAE features, whereas therapeutic administration significantly reduces clinical severity of EAE. Therapeutic efficacy observed in animal studies has been substantiated in phase 2 and 3 trials involving patients with relapsing or relapsing-remitting MS."

                "abstract": "FTY720 (fingolimod) is a first-in-class sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that was highly effective in Phase II clinical trials for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). FTY720 is phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase-2 to form the active moiety FTY720-phosphate that binds to four of the five G protein-coupled S1P receptor subtypes. Studies using conditional S1P1 receptor-deficient and sphingosine kinase-deficient mice showed that the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes requires signalling of lymphocytic S1P1 receptors by the endogenous ligand S1P. The S1P mimetic FTY720-phosphate causes internalization and degradation of cell membrane-expressed S1P1, thereby antagonizing S1P action at the receptor. In models of human MS and demyelinating polyneuropathies, functional antagonism of lymphocytic S1P1 slows S1P-driven egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, thereby reducing the numbers of autoaggressive TH17 cells that recirculate via lymph and blood to the central nervous system and the sciatic/ischiatic nerves. Based on its lipophilic nature, FTY720 crosses the blood-brain barrier, and ongoing experiments suggest that the drug also down-modulates S1P1 in neural cells/astrocytes to reduce astrogliosis, a phenomenon associated with neurodegeneration in MS. This may help restore gap-junctional communication of astrocytes with neurons and cells of the blood-brain barrier. Additional effects may result from (down-) modulation of S1P3 in astrocytes and of S1P1 and S1P5 in oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, FTY720 may act through immune-based and central mechanisms to reduce inflammation and support structural restoration of the central nervous system parenchyma. Beyond the autoimmune indications, very recent studies suggest that short-term, low-dose administration of FTY720 could help treat chronic (viral) infections. Differential effects of the drug on the trafficking of na\u00efve, central memory and effector memory T cell subsets are discussed."

Here, we identify an in vivo astrocyte subpopulation termed immediate-early astrocytes (ieAstrocytes) that is defined by functional c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP+ cell populations during EAE. More than 95% of the GFP+ cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity-in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells-which constituted ieAstrocytes that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. ieAstrocyte formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P1. ieAstrocytes thus represent a functionally defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity in vivo. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases."

                "abstract": "Fingolimod is the first oral disease-modifying therapy approved for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Following phosphorylation in vivo, the active agent, fingolimod phosphate (fingolimod-P), acts as a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, binding with high affinity to four of the five known S1P receptors (S1P1, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5). The mechanism of action of fingolimod in MS has primarily been considered as immunomodulatory, whereby fingolimod-P modulates S1P1 on lymphocytes, selectively retaining autoreactive lymphocytes in lymph nodes to reduce damaging infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). However, emerging evidence indicates that fingolimod has direct effects in the CNS in MS. For example, in the MS animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), fingolimod is highly efficacious in both a prophylactic and therapeutic setting, yet becomes ineffective in animals selectively deficient for S1P1 on astrocytes, despite maintained normal immunologic receptor expression and functions, and S1P-mediated immune activities. Here we review S1P signaling effects relevant to MS in neural cell types expressing S1P receptors, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, microglia and dendritic cells. The direct effects of fingolimod on these CNS cells observed in preclinical studies are discussed in view of the functional consequences of reducing neurodegenerative processes and promoting myelin preservation and repair. The therapeutic implications of S1P modulation in the CNS are considered in terms of the clinical outcomes of MS, such as reducing MS-related brain atrophy, and other CNS disorders. Additionally, we briefly outline other existing and investigational MS therapies that may also have effects in the CNS."

Here we investigated the role of the crosstalk between sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and cytokine signaling cascades in astrocyte activation and inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, and addressed the effects of fingolimod on astrocyte-neuron interaction and NO synthesis in vivo. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy were used to detect S1P receptors, interleukin (IL) 1R, IL17RA, and nitrosative stress in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) spinal cord, and the spinal cord of fingolimod-treated EAE mice. An in vitro model was established to study the effects of S1P, IL1, and IL17 stimulation on NFkB translocation and NO production in astrocytes, on spinal neuron survival, and on astrocyte-neuron interaction. Furthermore, fingolimod efficacy in blocking astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration was evaluated. RESULTS: We found coordinated upregulation of IL1R, IL17RA, S1P1, and S1P3 together with nitrosative markers in astrocytes within MS and EAE lesions. In vitro studies revealed that S1P, IL17, and IL1 induced NF\u03baB translocation and NO production in astrocytes, and astrocyte conditioned media triggered neuronal death. Importantly, fingolimod blocked the 2 activation events evoked in astrocytes by either S1P or inflammatory cytokines, resulting in inhibition of astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration. Finally, therapeutic administration of fingolimod to EAE mice hampered astrocyte activation and NO production. INTERPRETATION: A neuroprotective effect of fingolimod in vivo may result from its inhibitory action on key astrocyte activation steps."

                "abstract": "The family of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) is G-protein-coupled, comprised of subtypes S1PR1-S1PR5 and activated by the endogenous ligand S1P. The phosphorylated version of Fingolimod (pFTY720), an oral therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS), induces S1PR1 internalisation in T cells, subsequent insensitivity to S1P gradients and sequestering of these cells within lymphoid organs, thus limiting immune response. S1PRs are also expressed in neuronal and glial cells where pFTY720 is suggested to directly protect against lysolecithin-induced deficits in myelination state in organotypic cerebellar slices. Of note, the effect of pFTY720 on immune cells already migrated into the CNS, prior to treatment, has not been well established. We have previously found that organotypic slice cultures do contain immune cells, which, in principle, could also be regulated by pFTY720 to maintain levels of myelin. Here, a mouse organotypic cerebellar slice and splenocyte co-culture model was thus used to investigate the effects of pFTY720 on splenocyte-induced demyelination. Spleen cells isolated from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunised mice (MOG-splenocytes) or from 2D2 transgenic mice (2D2-splenocytes) both induced demyelination when co-cultured with mouse organotypic cerebellar slices, to a similar extent as lysolecithin. As expected, in vivo treatment of MOG-immunised mice with FTY720 inhibited demyelination induced by MOG-splenocytes. Importantly, in vitro treatment of MOG- and 2D2-splenocytes with pFTY720 also attenuated demyelination caused by these cells. In addition, while in vitro treatment of 2D2-splenocytes with pFTY720 did not alter cell phenotype, pFTY720 inhibited the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and interleukin 6 (IL6) from these cells. This work suggests that treatment of splenocytes by pFTY720 attenuates demyelination and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine release, which likely contributes to enhanced myelination state induced by pFTY720 in organotypic cerebellar slices.

In this study, we investigated the effects of FTY720 treatment on disease severity and histopathology of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the dark agouti (DA) rat, a model that closely mimics several features of MS. The effects of FTY720 on T-cell subsets, anti-MOG antibody production, and mRNA expression of a number of cytokines and other genes were also examined. Commencement of treatment before disease onset prevented the appearance of clinical disease. Therapeutic treatment after established disease reduced clinical scores and substantially attenuated inflammation, demyelination, and axon loss. EAE suppression was associated with a reduction in all measured T-cell subsets in blood and spleen and a significant decrease in serum IgG(2a) levels. However, in the lymph nodes, all T-cell subsets except for na\u00efve T cells and recent thymic emigrants remained unaffected. In addition, FTY720 treatment led to a significant inhibition in interferon-gamma, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression in the MOG-EAE spinal cord.

Within the immune system, downmodulation of S1P(1) prevents the egress of B and T cells from lymph nodes (LN) into the lymphatic circulation. This is especially relevant in certain autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), in which demyelination and brain atrophy occur due to the presence of autoreactive lymphocytes within the CNS. Accordingly, S1P(1)-directed pharmacologic interventions that aim to retain these autoreactive lymphocytes in the LN and thus prevent their recirculation and subsequent infiltration into the CNS have been investigated as a means of preventing disease progression in patients with MS. Fingolimod (FTY720), a structural analog of sphingosine, is phosphorylated in vivo into fingolimod phosphate by sphingosine kinase-2. Fingolimod phosphate, which binds to S1PRs, has been shown to modulate the activity of S1P(1) in patients with MS and to reduce immune cell infiltration into the CNS, consistent with its previously established effects in animal models of the disease. Preclinical studies also suggest that fingolimod has beneficial effects within the CNS that are independent of its immune cell trafficking activity. This review highlights the normal physiologic processes modulated by S1P and S1PRs, and the therapeutic effects of S1PR modulation in the immune, central nervous, and cardiovascular systems."

In an in\u00a0vivo setting, the application of ST-968 or ST-1071 to mice resulted in a reduction of blood lymphocytes and significantly reduced the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice comparable to FTY720 either by prophylactic or therapeutic treatment. In parallel to the reduced clinical symptoms, infiltration of immune cells in the brain was strongly reduced, and in isolated tissues of brain and spinal cord, the mRNA and protein expressions of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, as well as of matrix metalloproteinase-9 were reduced by all compounds, whereas PECAM-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 were upregulated. In summary, the data suggest that these novel butterfly derivatives of FTY720 could have considerable implication for future therapies of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases. "

FTY720 (fingolimod) is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and sphingosine analog approved for MS therapy that can functionally antagonize S1P1. Here, we report that FTY720 suppresses neuroinflammation by functionally and physically regulating the B12 pathways. Genetic and pharmacological S1P1 inhibition upregulates a transcobalamin 2 (TCN2)-B12 receptor, CD320, in immediate-early astrocytes (ieAstrocytes; a c-Fos-activated astrocyte subset that tracks with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE] severity). CD320 is also reduced in MS plaques. Deficiency of CD320 or dietary B12 restriction worsens EAE and eliminates FTY720's efficacy while concomitantly downregulating type I interferon signaling. TCN2 functions as a chaperone for FTY720 and sphingosine, whose complex induces astrocytic CD320 internalization, suggesting a delivery mechanism of FTY720/sphingosine via the TCN2-CD320 pathway. Taken together, the B12-TCN2-CD320 pathway is essential for the mechanism of action of FTY720."

FTY720 has become the first oral treatment for relapsing MS that was approved by the FDA in September 2010. Phosphorylated FTY720 modulates four of the five known S1P receptors (S1P(1), S1P(3), S1P(4), and S1P(5)) at high affinity. Studies in human MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have revealed that FTY720 exposure alters lymphocyte trafficking via sequestration of auto-aggressive lymphocytes within lymphoid organs, representing the current understanding of its mechanism of action. These effects primarily involve S1P(1), which is thought to attenuate inflammatory insults in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, FTY720's actions may involve direct effects on S1P receptor-mediated signaling in CNS cells, based upon the known expression of S1P receptors in CNS cell types relevant to MS, access to the CNS through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and in vitro studies. These data implicate lysophospholipid signaling--via S1P(1) and perhaps other lysophospholipid receptors--in therapeutic approaches to MS and potentially other diseases with immunological and/or neurological components."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disorder characterized by massive neurodegeneration and profound axonal loss. Since myelin is enriched with sphingolipids and some of them display toxicity, biological function of sphingolipids in demyelination has been investigated in MS brain tissues. An elevation of sphingosine with a decrease in monoglycosylceramide and psychosine (myelin markers) was observed in MS white matter and plaque compared to normal brain tissue. This indicated that sphingosine toxicity might mediate oligodendrocyte degeneration. To explain the source of sphingosine accumulation, total sphingolipid profile was investigated in Lewis rats after inducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and also in human oligodendrocytes in culture. An intermittent increase in ceramide followed by sphingosine accumulation in EAE spinal cord along with a stimulation of serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity was observed. Apoptosis was identified in the lumbar spinal cord, the most prominent demyelinating area, in the EAE rats. TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 stimulation of oligodendrocytes in culture also led to an accumulation of ceramide with an elevation of sphingosine. Ceramide elevation was drastically blocked by myriocin, an inhibitor of SPT, and also by FTY720. Myriocin treatment also protected oligodendrocytes from cytokine mediated apoptosis or programmed cell death. Hence, we propose that sphingosine toxicity may contribute to demyelination in both EAE and MS, and the intermittent ceramide accumulation in EAE may, at least partly, be mediated via SPT activation, which is a novel observation that has not been previously reported."

Therapeutics that impact remyelination in the CNS could be critical determinants of long-term functional outcome in multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod is a S1P receptor modulator in MS clinical trials due to systemic anti-inflammatory properties, yet may impact cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies using isolated dissociated cultures indicate that neural cells express S1P receptors and respond to receptor engagement. Our objective was to assess the effects of fingolimod on myelin-related processes within a multicellular environment that maintains physiological cell-cell interactions, using organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Fingolimod treatment had no impact on myelin under basal conditions. Fingolimod treatment subsequent to lysolecithin-induced demyelination enhanced remyelination and process extension by OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes, while increasing microglia numbers and immunoreactivity for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The number of phagocytosing microglia was not increased by fingolimod. Using S1P receptor specific agonists and antagonists, we determined that fingolimod-induced effects on remyelination and astrogliosis were mediated primarily through S1P3 and S1P5, whereas enhanced microgliosis was mediated through S1P1 and S1P5. Taken together, these data demonstrate that fingolimod modulates multiple neuroglial cell responses, resulting in enhanced remyelination in organotypic slice cultures that maintain the complex cellular interactions of the mammalian brain."

The experimental antigen-induced encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice is a useful animal model of MS, which allows exploring the etiopathogenetic mechanisms and testing novel potential therapeutic drugs. A new therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of MS was introduced in 2010 through the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analogue fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya\u00ae), which acts as a functional S1P1 antagonist on T lymphocytes to deplete these cells from the blood. In this study, we synthesized two novel structures, ST-1893 and ST-1894, which are derived from fingolimod and chemically feature a morpholine ring in the polar head group. These compounds showed a selective S1P1 activation profile and a sustained S1P1 internalization in cultures of S1P1-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, consistent with a functional antagonism. In vivo, both compounds induced a profound lymphopenia in mice. Finally, these substances showed efficacy in the EAE model, where they reduced clinical symptoms of the disease, and, on the molecular level, they reduced the T-cell infiltration and several inflammatory mediators in the brain and spinal cord. In summary, these data suggest that S1P1-selective compounds may have an advantage over fingolimod and siponimod, not only in MS but also in other autoimmune diseases."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) leading to functional deficits. The remyelination process is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, stimulates OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes, in addition to its well-known anti-inflammatory effect. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we performed a dose-response study of Fingolimod (0.15 or 0.3mg/kg bw), which was initiated on the day of EAE onset. The neurological function was tested to determine the optimal dose of Fingolimod. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to measure the profile of OPC proliferation and differentiation. The mechanistic premise underlying the therapeutic effect of Fingolimod, was that Fingolimod stimulates the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, and this pathway promotes OPC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, a loss-of-function study using cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, was employed in vivo. Protein levels of the Shh pathway were measured by Western blot analysis. We found that Fingolimod treatment (0.3mg/kg bw) significantly decreased cumulative disease score compared to the EAE control group. Concurrently, OPCs and proliferation of OPCs were significantly increased in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord at day 7 and day 30 after EAE onset, and oligodendrocytes, myelination and differentiation of OPCs were significantly increased at day 30 compared with the EAE control group. EAE mice treated with Fingolimod exhibited substantially elevated levels of Shh, its receptor Smoothened and effector Gli1 in the white matter of the CNS. However, combination treatment of EAE mice with cyclopamine-Fingolimod decreased Fingolimod monotherapy elevated protein levels of Smoothened and Gli1, and abolished the effect of Fingolimod on OPC proliferation and differentiation, as well as on neurological function outcome. Together, these data demonstrate that Fingolimod is effective as a treatment of EAE by promoting OPC proliferation and differentiation, which facilitate remyelination. In addition, the Shh pathway likely contributes to the therapeutic effects of Fingolimod on OPCs. "

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fingolimod has recently been approved for the therapy of relapsing multiple sclerosis. This drug binds to different sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. AIM: To analyze basic mechanisms of action that can account for the efficacy of this drug in multiple sclerosis. DEVELOPMENT: Fingolimod acts as an inverse agonist on sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, inducing degradation of receptors. On lymphoid circulation, this effect causes retention in lymph nodes of naive and central memory T cells, including Th17 T lymphocytes, bearing CCR7 and CD62L receptors. As a result, the level of circulating T cells is markedly decreased. B ell circulation is impaired and complex effects on other immune cells are also induced. Fingolimod enters the central nervous system and binds to receptors on glial cells and neurons. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the therapeutic efficacy of fingolimod is not only associated with a reduced entry of inflammatory cells into the nervous system, but also with a direct effect mostly on astroglial cells. CONCLUSIONS: In multiple sclerosis patients, the available evidence indicates that fingolimod efficacy is directly associated with impairment of circulation of several T cell subsets and possibly B cells. Animal studies raise the possibility that an additional effect on glial cells might also contribute to the clinical efficacy."

Fingolimod, a nonselective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that induces sustained lymphopenia and accumulates in the CNS, represents a new treatment modality for MS. We hypothesized that sustained lymphopenia would not be required for efficacy and that a selective, CNS-penetrant, peripherally short-acting, S1P(1) agonist would show full efficacy in a mouse MS model. Using daily treatment with 10 mg/kg 2-(4-(5-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl amino)ethanol (CYM-5442) at the onset of clinical signs in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG(35-55)- induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), we assessed clinical scores, CNS cellular infiltration, demyelination, and gliosis for 12 days with CYM-5442, vehicle, or fingolimod. CYM-5442 levels in CNS and plasma were determined at experiment termination, and blood lymphopenia was measured 3 and 24 h after the last injection. Plasma levels of cytokines were assayed at the end of the protocol. Changes in S1P(1)-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression on neurons and astrocytes during active EAE and upon CYM-5442 treatment were quantified with flow cytometry and Western blotting by using native-locus enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged S1P(1) mice. S1P(1) agonism alone reduced pathological features as did fingolimod (maximally lymphopenic throughout), despite full reversal of lymphopenia within each dosing interval. CYM-5442 levels in CNS but not in plasma were sustained. Neuronal and astrocytic S1P(1) expression in EAE was suppressed by CYM-5442 treatment, relative to vehicle, and levels of key cytokines, such as interleukin 17A, were also significantly reduced in drug-treated mice. S1P(1)-selective agonists that induce reversible lymphopenia while persisting in the CNS may be effective MS treatments."

We report that IL-11 is produced at highest frequency by myeloid cells among the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets. Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) have an increased frequency of IL-11+ monocytes, IL-11+ and IL-11R+ CD4+ lymphocytes, and IL-11R+ neutrophils in comparison to matched healthy controls. IL-11+ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)+ monocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, and neutrophils accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The effect of IL-11 in-vitro stimulation, examined using single-cell RNA sequencing, revealed the highest number of differentially expressed genes in classical monocytes, including up-regulated NFKB1, NLRP3, and IL1B. All CD4+ cell subsets had increased expression of S100A8/9 alarmin genes involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In IL-11R+-sorted cells from the CSF, classical and intermediate monocytes significantly up-regulated the expression of multiple NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes, including complement, IL18, and migratory genes (VEGFA/B) in comparison to blood-derived cells. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway with \u03b1IL-11 mAb in mice with RR experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) decreased clinical scores, CNS inflammatory infiltrates, and demyelination. \u03b1IL-11 mAb treatment decreased the numbers of NF\u03baBp65+, NLRP3+, and IL-1\u03b2+ monocytes in the CNS of mice with EAE. The results suggest that IL-11/IL-11R signaling in monocytes represents a therapeutic target in RRMS."

Following activation with IL-1\u03b2, CNS ECs release GM-CSF, which in turn converts monocytes into antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Accordingly, spinal cord-infiltrated monocyte-derived APCs are associated with dividing CD4+ T cells. Factors released from the interaction between IL-1\u03b2-competent myeloid cells and CD4+ T cells are highly toxic to neurons.

METHODS: Primary human monocytes and the THP-1 human monocyte cell line were used to determine the effects of short- and longterm exposure to UA on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion by ELISA and cell-based assays. Expression of key NLRP3 components in monocytes from patients with a history of gout were analyzed by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Precipitation of UA was required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent release of IL-1\u03b2 in human monocytes. Neither monosodium urate (MSU) crystals nor soluble UA had any effect on activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-\u03baB. Prolonged exposure of monocytes to soluble UA did not alter these responses. However, both MSU crystals and soluble UA did result in a 2-fold increase in reactive oxygen species. Patients with gout (n = 15) had significantly elevated serum UA concentrations compared to healthy individuals (n = 16), yet secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components in monocytes isolated from these patients were not different from those of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Despite reports indicating that soluble UA can prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, precipitation of soluble UA into MSU crystals is essential for in vitro NLRP3 signaling in primary human monocytes."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Traumatic injury or severe surgery leads to a profound immune response with a diminished functionality of monocytes and subsequently their IL-1\u03b2 release. IL-1\u03b2 plays an important role in host immunity and protection against infections. Its biological activation via IL-1\u03b2-precursor processing requires the transcription of inflammasome components and their activation. Deregulated activity of NOD-like receptor inflammasomes (NLR) like NLRP3 that leads to the maturation of IL-1\u03b2 has been described in various diseases. While the role of other inflammasomes has been studied in monocytes, nothing is known about NLRP3 inflammasome after a traumatic injury. Here, the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in impaired monocyte functionality after a traumatic injury was analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ex vivo-in vitro stimulation of isolated CD14+ monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed a significantly higher IL-1\u03b2 secretion in healthy volunteers (HV) compared to trauma patients (TP) after admission. Reduced IL-1\u03b2 secretion was paralleled by significantly lowered gene expression of NLRP3 in monocytes from TP compared to those of HV. Transfection of monocytes with NLRP3-encoding plasmid recovered the functionality of monocytes from TP regarding the IL-1\u03b2 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CD14+ monocytes from TP are significantly diminished in their function and that the presence of NLRP3 components is necessary in recovering the ability of monocytes to produce active IL-1\u03b2. This recovery of the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes may imply a new target for treatment and therapy of immune suppression after severe injury."

Here, using genetic approaches and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of inflammatory demyelination, we identified a negative regulatory pathway for caspase-8 in infiltrated macrophages whereby it functions to restrain interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-driven autoimmune inflammation. Caspase-8 is partially activated in macrophages/microglia in active lesions of multiple sclerosis. Selective ablation of Casp8 in myeloid cells, but not microglia, exacerbated autoimmune demyelination. Heightened IL-1\u03b2 production by caspase-8-deficient macrophages underlies exacerbated activation of encephalitogenic T cells and production of GM-CSF and interferon-\u03b3. Mechanistically, IL-1\u03b2 overproduction by primed caspase-8-deficient macrophages was mediated by RIPK1/RIPK3 through the engagement of NLRP3 inflammasome and was independent of cell death. When instructed by autoreactive CD4 T cells in the presence of antigen, caspase-8-deficient macrophages, but not their wild-type\u00a0counterparts, released significant amount of IL-1\u03b2 that in turn acted through IL-1R to amplify T cell activation. Moreover, the worsened experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis progression in myeloid Casp8 mutant mice was completely reversed when Ripk3 was simultaneously deleted. Together, these data reveal a functional link between T cell-driven autoimmunity and inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 that is negatively regulated by caspase-8, and suggest that dysregulation of the pathway may contribute to inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis."

It has been also reported as a transcription factor related to Th2 pattern, although its role in the adaptive immunity has been controversial, mainly because the studies were performed using gene deletion approaches. In the present study, we have investigated the NLRP3 gain-of-function in the context of encephalomyelitis autoimmune disease (EAE), considered to be a Th1- and Th17-mediated disease. We took advantage of an animal model with NLRP3 gain-of-function exclusively to T CD4+ lymphocytes (CD4CreNLRP3fl/fl). These mice presented reduced clinical score, accompanied by less infiltrating T CD4+ cells expressing both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 at the central nervous system (CNS) during the peak of the disease. However, besides NLRP3 gain-of-function in lymphocytes, these mice lack NLRP3 expression in non-T CD4+ cells. Therefore, in order to circumvent this deficiency, we transferred naive CD4+ T cells from WT, NLRP3-/- or CD4CreNLRP3fl/fl into Rag-1-/- mice and immunized them with MOG35-55 Likewise, the animals repopulated with CD4CreNLRP3fl/fl T CD4+ cells presented reduced clinical score and decreased IFN-\u03b3 production at the peak of the disease. Additionally, primary effector CD4+ T cells derived from these mice presented reduced glycolytic profile, a metabolic profile compatible with Th2 cells. Finally, naive CD4+ T cells from CD4CreNLRP3fl/fl mice under a Th2-related cytokine milieu cocktail exhibited in vitro an increased IL-4 and IL-13 production. Conversely, naive CD4+ T cells from CD4CreNLRP3fl/fl mice under Th1 differentiation produced less IFN-\u03b3 and T-bet. Altogether, our data evidence that the NLRP3 gain-of-function promotes a Th2-related response, a pathway that could be better explored in the treatment of multiple sclerosis."

Anti-dsDNA Abs isolated from active SLE patients were injected into female (NZB\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NZW) F1 mice and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the frequencies of Th17 and Treg were examined. RESULTS: The activity of caspase-1 was significantly increased in active SLE patients and was correlated with serum levels of anti-dsDNA Abs and disease activities. The concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17A were also significantly higher in SLE patients compared to healthy controls. Anti-dsDNA Ab-positive serum rather than healthy serum or RF (rheumatoid factor)-positive serum stimulated the activation of caspase-1 in monocytes. Anti-dsDNA Abs bound to TLR4 on macrophages and induced the production of ROS. Mitochondria-targeting antioxidant Mito-TEMPO, I\u03baB kinase inhibitor peptide or TLR4 siRNA inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 induced by anti-dsDNA Abs. Injection of anti-dsDNA Abs into (NZB\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NZW) F1 mice resulted in increased caspase-1 activation and production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17A. The Th17/Treg cell ratio also significantly increased following anti-dsDNA Ab injection. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-dsDNA Abs activated NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes/macrophages from SLE patients by binding to TLR4 and inducing the production of mitochondrial ROS."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: High-expression alleles of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are linked genetically to the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The U1 small nuclear RNP (snRNP) immune complex containing U1 snRNP and anti-U1 snRNP antibodies, which are found in patients with SLE, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, comprising NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase 1, in human monocytes, leading to the production of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). This study was undertaken to investigate the role of the snRNP immune complex in up-regulating the expression of MIF and its interface with the NLRP3 inflammasome. METHODS: MIF, IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3, caspase 1, ASC, and MIF receptors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CytoF) in human monocytes incubated with or without the snRNP immune complex. MIF pathway responses were probed with the novel small molecule antagonist MIF098. RESULTS: The snRNP immune complex induced the production of MIF and IL-1\u03b2 from human monocytes. High-dimensional, single-cell CytoF analysis established that MIF regulates activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, including findings of a quantitative relationship between MIF and its receptors and IL-1\u03b2 levels in the monocytes. MIF098, which blocks MIF binding to its cognate receptor, suppressed the production of IL-1\u03b2, the up-regulation of NLRP3, which is a rate-limiting step in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the activation of caspase 1 in snRNP immune complex-stimulated human monocytes. CONCLUSION: The U1 snRNP immune complex is a specific stimulus of MIF production in human monocytes, with MIF having an upstream role in defining the inflammatory characteristics of activated monocytes by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and downstream IL-1\u03b2 production. These findings provide mechanistic insight and a therapeutic rationale for targeting MIF in subgroups of lupus patients, such as those classified as high genotypic MIF expressers or those with anti-snRNP antibodies."

                "abstract": "Primary progressive multiple sclerosis is a poorly understood disease entity with no specific prognostic biomarkers and scarce therapeutic options. We aimed to identify disease activity biomarkers in multiple sclerosis by performing an RNA sequencing approach in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a discovery cohort of 44 untreated patients with multiple sclerosis belonging to different clinical forms and activity phases of the disease, and 12 healthy control subjects. A validation cohort of 58 patients with multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy control subjects was included in the study to replicate the RNA sequencing findings. The RNA sequencing revealed an interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) signature in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Subsequent immunophenotyping pointed to blood monocytes as responsible for the IL1B signature observed in this group of patients. Functional experiments at baseline measuring apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation showed that the NOD-leucine rich repeat and pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was overactive in monocytes from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a combination of ATP plus lipopolysaccharide was associated with increased IL1B production in this group of patients. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis patients with high IL1B gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells progressed significantly faster compared to patients with low IL1B levels based on the time to reach an EDSS of 6.0 and the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score. In agreement with peripheral blood findings, both NLRP3 and IL1B expression in brain tissue from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis was mainly restricted to cells of myeloid lineage. Treatment of mice with a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor attenuated established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease severity and improved CNS histopathology. NLRP3 inflammasome-specific inhibition was also effective in reducing axonal damage in a model of lipopolysaccharide-neuroinflammation using organotypic cerebellar cultures. Altogether, these results point to a role of IL1B and the NLRP3 inflammasome as prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target, respectively, in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis."

Undegraded DNA may accumulate in tissues and act as an inflammasome-activating signal. Herein, we investigated the occurrence of aberrant DNA build-up in various biologic compartments of SS patients and its correlation with the activity of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. For this purpose, we evaluated sera, PBMC, circulating monocytes and salivary glands (SG) from different SS patient subgroups and controls. We found that SS patients at high risk for lymphoma and those with established lymphoma display high serum cf-DNA levels, substantial extranuclear DNA accumulations in PBMC and SG tissues, a unique NLRP3 inflammasome gene signature in PBMC, and significantly increased serum IL-18 and ASC levels. In these patients, the circulating monocytes manifested NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased response to NLRP3 stimuli, whereas SG-infiltrating macrophages exhibited signs of NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis. Cell-free nucleic acids isolated from patients' sera competently primed the activation of both NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes in healthy monocytes. SS patients also manifested diminished DNaseI activity in serum and DNaseII expression in PBMC, which inversely correlated with indices of inflammasome activation. DNaseII gene-silencing in healthy monocytes led to cytoplasmic DNA deposition and activation of inflammasome-related genes and of caspase1. Our data reveal the occurrence of systemic NLRP3 inflammasome activation in severe SS, which is associated with widespread extranuclear accumulations of inflammagenic DNA and impaired DNA degradation. These findings can provide novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for the management of SS patients with adverse outcomes."

The present study evaluated whether silibinin (SB) treatment of monocytes from preeclamptic women could modulate NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes as well as TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway activation. Peripheral blood monocytes from 20 preeclamptic and 20 normotensive (NT) pregnant women, as well as the THP-1 cell line, were cultured with or without monosodium urate (MSU) or SB. NLRP1, NLRP3, Caspase-1, TLR4, MyD88, NF-\u03baB, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 gene expression by monocytes was analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while inflammatory cytokine production and p65NF-\u03baB activity were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB and NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasomes pathways in THP-1 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot respectively. Compared with NT women, monocytes from preeclamptic women showed The Ethics Committee of the Botucatu Medical School approved the study (protocol number 2.333.216)higher endogenous activation of NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasomes and the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway as well as higher gene and protein expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and TNF-\u03b1, and lower expression of IL-10. Monocyte stimulation with MSU increased inflammation-related genes as well as NF-\u03baB activity. In vitro, SB treatment of monocytes from preeclamptic women reduced the basal activation of these cells by decreasing NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasomes and p65NF-\u03baB activity. THP-1 cells exhibited a similar immunological response profile to monocytes from preeclamptic women when cultured with or without MSU or SB. These results suggest uric acid participates in the systemic inflammatory response characteristic of preeclampsia and that in vitro SB treatment can modulate the sterile inflammation established in monocytes from preeclamptic women."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common blistering autoimmune disease severely affecting older people. The complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity is critical in the development of BP. Inflammasomes, which lead to cleavage-induced maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, have been shown to participate in a variety of autoimmune diseases. However, the role of inflammasomes in BP has not been delineated. OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed to investigate whether inflammasomes are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of BP. METHODS: Expressions of inflammasome components at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with BP and from healthy controls were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot, respectively. ELISA was employed to evaluate interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and high-mobility group-1 (HMGB1) levels in the serum and blister fluid of patients with BP. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect IL-18 expression in the skin lesion of patients with BP. RESULTS: The mRNA levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-18) in PBMCs were significantly up-regulated in BP patients compared with those in healthy controls, and were positively correlated with the autoantibody titers for BP180-NC16A. Western Blot analysis showed that the baseline expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome components were increased in PBMCs of BP patients compared with healthy controls, and we failed to observe the mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Further analysis showed that IL-18 was elevated in serum, blister fluid and lesional skin from patients with BP, and the serum IL-18 level was positively correlated with the titers of anti-BP180-NC16A autoantibody in BP patient. Most importantly, we found that mRNA expressions of the NLRP3-caspase-1-IL-18 axis components and the serum IL-18 level in BP patients decreased dramatically after effective treatment, which indicated that the up-regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome was responsible, at least to a great degree, for the enhanced IL-18 level in BP patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the expression of the NLRP3-caspase-1-IL-18 axis is highly expressed in the PBMCs of patients with BP, and correlated with disease activity, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of BP."

TLR and NLRP3 inflammasome could contribute to the maintenance of the inflammatory status in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients, since SS-RBC act as danger signals activating these pathways. In this study, first, we evaluated TLR (2, 4, 5 and 9), NLRP3, Caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 expression in PBMC freshly isolated from SCA patients (SS-PBMC) in comparison with PBMC from healthy individuals (AA-PBMC). In the second moment, we investigated whether SS-RBC could interfere with the expression of these molecules in PBMC from healthy donor, in the absence or presence of hydroxyurea (HU) in vitro. TLRs and NLRP3 inflammasome expression were investigated by qPCR. IL-1\u03b2, Leukotriene-B4 (LTB4) and nitrite production were measured in PBMC (from healthy donor) culture supernatants. TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2 were highly expressed in SS-PBMC when compared to AA-PBMC. Additionally, SS-RBC induced TLR9, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 expression and induced IL-1\u03b2, LTB4 and nitrite production in PBMC cultures. HU did not prevent TLR and NLRP3 inflammasome expression, but increased TLR2 and IL-18 expression and reduced nitrite production. In conclusion, our data suggest that TLR and inflammasome complexes may be key inducers of inflammation in SCA patients, probably through SS-RBC; also, HU does not prevent NLRP3 inflammasome- and TLR-dependent inflammation, indicating the need to develop new therapeutic strategies to SCA patients that act with different mechanisms of those observed for HU."

                "abstract": "Aberrant activation of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, triggers a pathogenic inflammatory response in many inherited neurodegenerative disorders. Inflammation has recently been associated with valosin-containing protein (VCP)-associated diseases, caused by missense mutations in the VCP gene. This prompted us to investigate whether NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in VCP-associated diseases, which classically affects the muscles, bones, and brain. In this report, we demonstrate (i) an elevated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in VCP myoblasts, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of VCP patients, which was significantly decreased following in vitro treatment with the MCC950, a potent and specific inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome; (ii) a significant increase in the expression of NLRP3, caspase 1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 in the quadriceps muscles of VCPR155H/+ heterozygote mice, an experimental mouse model that has many clinical features of human VCP-associated myopathy; (iii) a significant increase of number of IL-1\u03b2(+)F4/80(+)Ly6C(+) inflammatory macrophages that infiltrate the muscles of VCPR155H/+ mice; (iv) NLRP3 inflammasome activation and accumulation IL-1\u03b2(+)F4/80(+)Ly6C(+) macrophages positively correlated with high expression of TDP-43 and p62/SQSTM1 markers of VCP pathology in damaged muscle; and (v) treatment of VCPR155H/+ mice with MCC950 inhibitor suppressed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the F4/80(+)Ly6C(+)IL-1\u03b2(+) macrophage infiltrates in the muscle, and significantly ameliorated muscle strength. Together, these results suggest that (i) NLRP3 inflammasome and local IL-1\u03b2(+)F4/80(+)Ly6C(+) inflammatory macrophages contribute to pathogenesis of VCP-associated myopathy and (ii) identified MCC950 specific inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome with promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of VCP-associated myopathy."

METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were treated with either clodronate liposomes to deplete peritoneal macrophages or GM-CSF antibody and were then challenged by intraperitoneal injection of MSU crystals. Peritoneal lavage fluid was collected, and cellular infiltration was determined by flow cytometry. Purified resident and MSU crystal-recruited monocyte/macrophages were stimulated ex vivo with MSU crystals. The interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels in lavage fluids and ex vivo assay supernatants were measured. GM-CSF-derived and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-derived macrophages were generated in vitro from bone marrow cells. Protein expression of IL-1\u03b2, caspase 1, NLRP3, and ASC by in vitro- and in vivo-generated monocyte/macrophages was analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Depletion of resident macrophages lowered MSU crystal-induced IL-1\u03b2 and GM-CSF levels in vivo as well as IL-1\u03b2 production by MSU crystal-recruited monocytes stimulated ex vivo. GM-CSF neutralization in vivo decreased MSU crystal-induced IL-1\u03b2 levels and neutrophil infiltration. MSU crystal-recruited monocyte/macrophages from GM-CSF-neutralized mice expressed lower levels of the macrophage marker CD115 and produced less IL-1\u03b2 following ex vivo stimulation. These monocytes exhibited decreased expression of NLRP3, pro/active IL-1\u03b2, and pro/active caspase 1. In vitro-derived GM-CSF-differentiated macrophages expressed higher levels of NLRP3, pro/active IL-1\u03b2, and pro/active caspase 1 compared to M-CSF-differentiated macrophages. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF plays a key role in the differentiation of MSU crystal-recruited monocytes into proinflammatory macrophages. GM-CSF production may therefore contribute to the exacerbation of inflammation in gout."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has emerged as a crucial cytokine that activates myeloid cells to initiate tissue inflammation. However, the molecular actions of GM-CSF against innate immunity are still poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the in vitro effects of GM-CSF on the activation of human myeloid lineages, neutrophils, and the underlying intracellular signaling mechanism, including inflammasome activation. METHODS: Human neutrophils were stimulated with GM-CSF in the presence or absence of tofacitinib. The cellular supernatants were analyzed for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and caspase-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Pro-IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expressions in human neutrophils were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein phosphorylation of neutrophils was assessed by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies. RESULTS: Stimulation with GM-CSF alone, but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha, was shown to increase the release of IL-1\u03b2 and cleaved caspase-1 (p20) from human neutrophils. Tofacitinib, which inhibits GM-CSF-induced Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)-mediated signal transduction, completely abrogated GM-CSF-induced IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-1 (p20) secretion from neutrophils. GM-CSF stimulation also induced pro-IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in neutrophils and induced NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) protein expression. Although tofacitinib pretreatment marginally inhibited GM-CSF-induced pro-IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression, tofacitinib completely abrogated NLRP3 protein expression in neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that GM-CSF signaling induces NLRP3 expression and subsequent IL-1\u03b2 production by affecting neutrophils, which may cause the activation of innate immunity. Therefore, GM-CSF is a key regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 production by activating innate immune cells. This process can be blocked by tofacitinib, which interferes with JAK/STAT signaling pathways."

Here, we examined whether such immunosuppressive effects might be elicited due to inflammasome inactivation. To this end, we treated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model of multiple sclerosis (MS) with the conditioned medium or purified exosomes/microvesicles (EMVs) obtained from relapsing-remitting-MS patients human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and investigated the regulation of NALP3 inflammasome. We noticed enhanced expression of NALP3, Cleaved Caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-18 in EAE mouse spinal cord. Conversely, hPDLSCs-conditioned medium and EMVs significantly blocked NALP3 inflammasome activation and provided protection from EAE. Reduction in NALP3, Cleaved Caspase 1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 level was noticed in conditioned medium and EMVs-treated EAE mice. Pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB were elevated in EAE, while hPDLSCs-conditioned medium and EMVs treatment reduced their expression and increased I\u03baB-\u03b1 expression. Characterization of hPDLSCs-conditioned medium showed substantial level of anti-inflammatory IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1). We propose that the immunosuppressive role of hPDLSCs-derived conditioned medium and EMVs in EAE mice may partly attribute to the presence of soluble immunomodulatory factors, NALP3 inflammasome inactivation, and NF-\u03baB reduction."

However, its role on the IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory cytokine production has not been studied. IL-1\u03b2 production is strictly regulated both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels through the activity of Nlrp3 inflammasome. In this study we aimed to determine the effect of Aloe vera on the molecular mechanisms of Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production in LPS-activated human THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results show that Aloe vera significantly reduced IL-8, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 cytokine production in a dose dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was substantially more pronounced in the primary cells. We found that Aloe vera inhibited the expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2, Nlrp3, caspase-1 as well as that of the P2X7 receptor in the LPS-induced primary macrophages. Furthermore, LPS-induced activation of signaling pathways like NF-\u03baB, p38, JNK and ERK were inhibited by Aloe vera in these cells. Altogether, we show for the first time that Aloe vera-mediated strong reduction of IL-1\u03b2 appears to be the consequence of the reduced expression of both pro-IL-1\u03b2 as well as Nlrp3 inflammasome components via suppressing specific signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, we show that the expression of the ATP sensor P2X7 receptor is also downregulated by Aloe vera that could also contribute to the attenuated IL-1\u03b2 cytokine secretion. These results may provide a new therapeutic approach to regulate inflammasome-mediated responses. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) results in overzealous production and infiltration of neutrophils to the ischemic heart. This is mediated in part by granulopoiesis induced by the S100A8/A9-NLRP3-IL-1\u03b2 signaling axis in injury-exposed neutrophils. Despite the transcriptional upregulation of the NLRP3 (Nod Like Receptor Family Pyrin Domain-Containing 3) inflammasome and associated signaling components in neutrophils, the serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin-1\u03b2), the effector molecule in granulopoiesis, were not affected by MI, suggesting that IL-1\u03b2 is not released systemically. We hypothesize that IL-1\u03b2 is released locally within the bone marrow (BM) by inflammasome-primed and reverse-migrating neutrophils. METHODS: Using a combination of time-dependent parabiosis and flow cytometry techniques, we first characterized the migration patterns of different blood cell types across the parabiotic barrier. We next induced MI in parabiotic mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery and examined the ability of injury-exposed neutrophils to permeate the parabiotic barrier and induce granulopoiesis in noninfarcted parabionts. Last, using multiple neutrophil adoptive and BM transplant studies, we studied the molecular mechanisms that govern reverse migration and retention of the primed neutrophils, IL-1\u03b2 secretion, and granulopoiesis. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. RESULTS: MI promoted greater accumulation of the inflammasome-primed neutrophils in the BM. Introducing a time-dependent parabiotic barrier to the free movement of neutrophils inhibited their ability to stimulate granulopoiesis in the noninfarcted parabionts. Previous priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome is not a prerequisite, but the presence of a functional CXCR4 (C-X-C-motif chemokine receptor 4) on the primed-neutrophils and elevated serum S100A8/A9 levels are necessary for homing and retention of the reverse-migrating neutrophils. In the BM, the primed-neutrophils secrete IL-1\u03b2 through formation of gasdermin D pores and promote granulopoiesis. Pharmacological and genetic strategies aimed at the inhibition of neutrophil homing or release of IL-1\u03b2 in the BM markedly suppressed MI-induced granulopoiesis and improved cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a new paradigm of how circulatory cells establish a direct communication between organs by delivering signaling molecules (eg, IL-1\u03b2) directly at the sites of action rather through systemic release. We suggest that this pathway may exist to limit the off-target effects of systemic IL-1\u03b2 release."

                "title": "Caffeine Inhibits Activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome via Autophagy to Attenuate Microglia-Mediated Neuroinflammation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.",
                "abstract": "The activation of microglia is an important cause of central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, the proinflammatory response induced by the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome can be amplified in microglia after NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Autophagy is closely related to the inflammatory response. Caffeine exerts anti-inflammatory and autophagy-stimulating effects, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. This study examined the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of caffeine on EAE. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were immunized\u00a0to induce\u00a0EAE and treated with caffeine to observe its effect on prognosis. The effects of caffeine on autophagy and inflammation were also analysed in mouse primary microglia (PM) and the BV2 cell line. The data demonstrated that caffeine reduced the clinical score, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the demyelination level, and the activation of microglia in EAE mice. Furthermore, caffeine increased the LC3-II/LC3-I levels and decreased the NLRP3 and P62 levels in EAE mice, whereas the autophagy inhibitor 3-methylamine (3-MA) blocked these effects. In vitro, caffeine promoted autophagy by suppressing the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and inhibited activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5)-specific siRNA abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of caffeine treatment in PM and BV2 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that caffeine exerts a newly discovered effect on EAE by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the induction of autophagy in microglia."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The dysregulation of the NLRP3 (NLR containing a pyrin domain) inflammasome is involved in autoinflammatory diseases. Adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) is regarded as an autoinflammatory disease. However, the pathogenic involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in AOSD remains unclear and NLRP3 activators in AOSD are currently unknown. METHODS: The mRNA expression of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 34 patients with AOSD and 14 healthy subjects was determined using quantitative-PCR (qPCR). The changes in mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in PBMC treated with the potential activator [imiquimod (IMQ)] or inhibitor of NLRP3 were evaluated using qPCR and immunoblotting, respectively. The supernatant levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Significantly higher mRNA levels of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling were observed in patients with AOSD compared with healthy controls. NLRP3 expressions were positively correlated with disease activity in patients with AOSD. IMQ (an effective Toll-like receptor 7 ligand; 10 \u00b5g/ml and 25 \u00b5g/ml) stimulation of PBMC from patients with AOSD induced dose-dependent increases of mRNA expression of NLRP3 (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean, 2.06 \u00b1 0.46 and 6.05 \u00b1 1.84, respectively), caspase-1 (1.81 \u00b1 0.23 and 4.25 \u00b1 0.48), IL-1\u03b2 (5.68 \u00b1 1.51 and 12.13 \u00b1 3.71), and IL-18 (2.32 \u00b1 0.37 and 4.81 \u00b1 0.51) compared with controls (all p < 0.005). IMQ stimulation of PBMC from patients similarly induced greater increases in protein expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome compared with controls. The protein expressions of NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 on PBMC significantly decreased after treatment with NLRP3 inhibitor in patients with AOSD. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and its positive correlation with disease activity in AOSD suggest its involvement in disease pathogenesis. IMQ upregulated expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, and IMQ might be an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome in AOSD."

            "abstract": "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent driver of type 1 immunity. Paradoxically, in autoimmune conditions, including of the CNS, IL-12 reduces inflammation. The underlying mechanism behind these opposing properties and the involved cellular players remain elusive. Here we map IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) expression to NK and T cells as well as neurons and oligodendrocytes. Conditionally ablating the IL-12R across these cell types in adult mice and assessing their susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis revealed that the neuroprotective role of IL-12 is mediated by neuroectoderm-derived cells, specifically neurons, and not immune cells. In human brain tissue from donors with multiple sclerosis, we observe an IL-12R distribution comparable to mice, suggesting similar mechanisms in mice and humans. Combining flow cytometry, bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we reveal an IL-12-induced neuroprotective tissue adaption preventing early neurodegeneration and sustaining trophic factor release during neuroinflammation, thereby maintaining CNS integrity in mice."

                "abstract": "Some aspects of CNS-directed autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis are modeled in mice by immunization with myelin Ags where tissue damage is driven by myelin-reactive Th1 and Th17 effector lymphocytes. Whether the CNS plays an active role in controlling such autoimmune diseases is unknown. We used mice in which IkappaB kinase beta was deleted from Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha-expressing neurons (nIKKbetaKO) to investigate the contribution of neuronal NF-kappaB to the development of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We show that nIKKbetaKO mice developed a severe, nonresolving disease with increased axon loss compared with controls and this was associated with significantly reduced CNS production of neuroprotective factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, CSF1-R, and FLIP) and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-12, IL-17, and CD30L) and chemokines. The isolation of CNS-infiltrating monocytes revealed greater numbers of CD4(+) T cells, reduced numbers of NK1.1(+) cells, and a selective accumulation of Th1 cells in nIKKbetaKO CNS from early in the disease. Our results show that neurons play an important role in determining the quality and outcome of CNS immune responses, specifically that neuronal IkappaB kinase beta is required for neuroprotection, suppression of inflammation, limitation of Th1 lymphocyte accumulation, and enhancement of NK cell recruitment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-affected CNS and stress the importance of neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is the founding member of a novel family of inflammatory cytokines that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). IL-17A signals through its receptor, IL-17RA, which is expressed in many peripheral tissues; however, expression of IL-17RA in the central nervous system (CNS) and its role in CNS inflammation are not well understood. METHODS: EAE was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein. IL-17RA expression in the CNS was compared between control and EAE mice using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Cell-type specific expression was examined in isolated astrocytic and microglial cell cultures. Cytokine and chemokine production was measured in IL-17A treated cultures to evaluate the functional status of IL-17RA. RESULTS: Here we report increased IL-17RA expression in the CNS of mice with EAE, and constitutive expression of functional IL-17RA in mouse CNS tissue. Specifically, astrocytes and microglia express IL-17RA in vitro, and IL-17A treatment induces biological responses in these cells, including significant upregulation of MCP-1, MCP-5, MIP-2 and KC chemokine secretion. Exogenous IL-17A does not significantly alter the expression of IL-17RA in glial cells, suggesting that upregulation of chemokines by glial cells is due to IL-17A signaling through constitutively expressed IL-17RA. CONCLUSION: IL-17RA expression is significantly increased in the CNS of mice with EAE compared to healthy mice, suggesting that IL-17RA signaling in glial cells can play an important role in autoimmune inflammation of the CNS and may be a potential pathway to target for therapeutic interventions."

                "abstract": "Signaling by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is essential for the development of the central nervous system (CNS) and regulates neuronal survival and myelination in the adult CNS. In neuroinflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), IGF-1 can regulate cellular survival and activation in a context-dependent and cell-specific manner. Notwithstanding its importance, the functional outcome of IGF-1 signaling in microglia/macrophages, which maintain CNS homeostasis and regulate neuroinflammation, remains undefined. As a result, contradictory reports on the disease-ameliorating efficacy of IGF-1 are difficult to interpret, together precluding its potential use as a therapeutic agent. To fill this gap, we here investigated the role of IGF-1 signaling in CNS-resident microglia and border associated macrophages (BAMs) by conditional genetic deletion of the receptor Igf1r in these cell types. Using a series of techniques including histology, bulk RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and intravital imaging, we show that absence of IGF-1R significantly impacted the morphology of both BAMs and microglia. RNA analysis revealed minor changes in microglia. In BAMs however, we detected an upregulation of functional pathways associated with cellular activation and a decreased expression of adhesion molecules. Notably, genetic deletion of Igf1r from CNS-resident macrophages led to a significant weight gain in mice, suggesting that absence of IGF-1R from CNS-resident myeloid cells indirectly impacts the somatotropic axis. Lastly, we observed a more severe EAE disease course upon Igf1r genetic ablation, thus highlighting an important immunomodulatory role of this signaling pathway in BAMs/microglia. Taken together, our work shows that IGF-1R signaling in CNS-resident macrophages regulates the morphology and transcriptome of these cells while significantly decreasing the severity of autoimmune CNS inflammation."

                "abstract": "The signaling axis of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been an important component in overcoming diabetes, and recent reports have uncovered novel beneficial roles of this signaling axis in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia, accelerating processes for exendin-4 repositioning. Here, we studied whether multiple sclerosis (MS) could be a complement to the CNS disorders that are associated with the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis. Both components of the signaling axis, GLP-1 and GLP-1R proteins, are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the spinal cord of normal mice. In particular, they are abundant in Iba1-positive microglia. Upon challenge by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, the mRNA expression of both GLP-1 and GLP-1R was markedly downregulated in EAE-symptomatic spinal cords, indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in EAE. Such a downregulation obviously occurred in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia, a main cell type to express both GLP-1 and GLP-1R, further indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in activated microglia. To investigate whether increased activity of GLP-1R has a therapeutic benefit, exendin-4 (5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.p.), a GLP-1R agonist, was administered daily to EAE-symptomatic mice. Exendin-4 administration to symptomatic EAE mice significantly improved the clinical signs of the disease, along with the reversal of histopathological sequelae such as cell accumulation, demyelination, astrogliosis, microglial activation, and morphological transformation of activated microglia in the injured spinal cord. Such an improvement by exendin-4 was comparable to that by FTY720 (3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), a drug for MS. The neuroprotective effects of exendin-4 against EAE were also associated with decreased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, all of which are usually upregulated in injured sites of the EAE spinal cord. Interestingly, exendin-4 exposure similarly reduced mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-stimulated microglia. Furthermore, exendin-4 administration significantly attenuated activation of NF-\u03baB signaling in EAE spinal cord and LPS-stimulated microglia. Collectively, the current study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of exendin-4 for MS by reducing immune responses in the CNS, highlighting the importance of the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for MS."

                "abstract": "Background: Interleukin 37 (IL-37), a member of IL-1 family, broadly suppresses inflammation in many pathological conditions by acting as a dual-function cytokine in that IL-37 signals via the extracellular receptor complex IL1-R5/IL-1R8, but it can also translocate to the nucleus. However, whether IL-37 exerts beneficial actions in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, remains to be elucidated. Thus, the goals of the present study were to evaluate the therapeutic effects of IL-37 in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, and if so, whether this is mediated via the extracellular receptor complex IL-1R5/IL-1R8. Methods: We used a murine model of MS, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We induced EAE in three different single and double transgenic mice (hIL-37tg, IL-1R8 KO, hIL-37tg-IL-1R8 KO) and wild type littermates. We also induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice and treated them with various forms of recombinant human IL-37 protein. Functional and histological techniques were used to assess locomotor deficits and demyelination. Luminex and flow cytometry analysis were done to assess the protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and different immune cell populations, respectively. qPCRs were done to assess the expression of IL-37, IL-1R5 and IL-1R8 in the spinal cord of EAE, and in blood peripheral mononuclear cells and brain tissue samples of MS patients. Results: We demonstrate that IL-37 reduces inflammation and protects against neurological deficits and myelin loss in EAE mice by acting via IL1-R5/IL1-R8. We also reveal that administration of recombinant human IL-37 exerts therapeutic actions in EAE mice. We finally show that IL-37 transcripts are not up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in brain lesions of MS patients, despite the IL-1R5/IL-1R8 receptor complex is expressed. Conclusions: This study presents novel data indicating that IL-37 exerts therapeutic effects in EAE by acting through the extracellular receptor complex IL-1R5/IL-1R8, and that this protective physiological mechanism is defective in MS individuals. IL-37 may therefore represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of MS with great promising potential."

                "abstract": "The CNS innate immune response is a \"double-edged sword\" representing a fine balance between protective antipathogen responses and detrimental neurocytotoxic effects. Hence, it is important to identify the key regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of CNS innate immunity and which could be harnessed to explore novel therapeutic avenues. In analogy to the newly described neuroimmune regulatory proteins also known as \"don't eat me\" signals (CD200, CD47, CD22, fractalkine, semaphorins), we herein identify the key role of complement regulator factor H (fH) in controlling neuroinflammation initiated in an acute mouse model of Ab-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mouse fH was found to be abundantly expressed by primary cultured neurons and neuronal cell lines (N1E115 and Neuro2a) at a level comparable to BV2 microglia and CLTT astrocytes. Mouse neurons expressed other complement regulators crry and low levels of CD55. In the brain, the expression of fH was localized to neuronal bodies and axons, endothelial cells, microglia but not oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths and was dramatically reduced in inflammatory experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis settings. When exogenous human fH was administered to disease Ab-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animals, there was a significant decrease in clinical score, inflammation, and demyelination, as compared with PBS-injected animals. We found that the accumulation of human fH in the brain parenchyma protected neurons from complement opsonization, axonal injury, and leukocyte infiltration. Our data argue for a key regulatory activity of fH in neuroprotection and provide novel therapeutic avenues for CNS chronic inflammatory diseases."

                "abstract": "IL-12 was thought to be involved in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a Th1 cell-mediated autoimmune disorder of the CNS. However, we have recently found that IL-12 responsiveness, via IL-12Rbeta2, is not required in the induction of EAE. To determine the role of IL-12Rbeta1, a key subunit for the responsiveness to both IL-12 and IL-23, in the development of autoimmune diseases, we studied EAE in mice deficient in this subunit of IL-12R. IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) mice are completely resistant to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE, with an autoantigen-specific Th2 response. To study the mechanism underlying this Th2 bias, we cocultured purified CD4(+) T cells and APCs of MOG-immunized mice. We demonstrate that IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) APCs drive CD4(+) T cells of both wild-type and IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) mice to an Ag-induced Th2 phenotype, whereas wild-type APCs drive these CD4(+) T cells toward a Th1 type. IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) CD4(+) T cells, in turn, appear to exert an immunoregulatory effect on the capacity of wild-type APCs to produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, decreased levels of IL-12p40, p35, and IL-23p19 mRNA expression were found in IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) APCs, indicating an autocrine pathway of IL-12/IL-23 via IL-12Rbeta1. IL-18 production and IL-18Ralpha expression are also significantly decreased in IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) mice immunized with MOG. We conclude that in the absence of IL-12Rbeta1, APCs play a prominent regulatory role in the induction of autoantigen-specific Th2 cells."

In MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, Treg function is impaired. We show that a recently approved drug, Nle4-d-Phe7-\u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-MSH), induced functional Treg, resulting in amelioration of EAE progression in mice. NDP-MSH also prevented immune cell infiltration into the CNS by restoring the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. NDP-MSH exerted long-lasting neuroprotective effects in mice with EAE and prevented excitotoxic death and reestablished action potential firing in mouse and human neurons in vitro. Neuroprotection by NDP-MSH was mediated via signaling through the melanocortin-1 and orphan nuclear 4 receptors in mouse and human neurons. NDP-MSH may be of benefit in treating neuroinflammatory diseases such as relapsing-remitting MS and related disorders."

Additional studies with NK cells might provide insight into the mechanism of action of MS therapies such as daclizumab, an antibody against the interleukin (IL)-2R \u03b1-chain, which induces expansion of CD56(bright) NK cells. METHODS: In a relapsing-remitting form of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS induced in SJL mice, we expanded NK cells with IL-2 coupled with an anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and evaluated the effects of these NK cells on EAE. Further, we investigated the effect of the human version of IL-2/IL-2 mAb on NK cells from MS patients and its effect on central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and pathology in a human-mouse chimera model and assessed the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: IL-2/IL-2 mAb dramatically expands NK cells both in the peripheral lymphoid organs and in the CNS, and attenuates CNS inflammation and neurological deficits. Disease protection is conferred by CNS-resident NK cells. Importantly, the human version of IL-2/IL-2 mAb restored the defective CD56(+) NK cells from MS patients in a human-mouse chimera model. Both the CD56(bright) and CD56(dim) subpopulations were required to attenuate disease in this model. INTERPRETATION: These findings unveil the immunotherapeutic potential of NK cells, which can act as critical suppressor cells in target organs of autoimmunity. These results also have implications to better understand the mechanism of action of daclizumab in MS."

                "abstract": "Glial connexins (Cxs) form gap junction channels through which a pan-glial network plays key roles in maintaining homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). In multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), expression of astrocytic Cx43 is lost in acute lesions but upregulated in chronic plaques, while astrocytic Cx30 is very low in normal white matter and changes in its expression have not been convincingly shown. In Cx30 or Cx43 single knockout (KO) mice and even in Cx30/Cx43 double KO mice, acute EAE is unaltered. However, the effects of Cx30/Cx43 deficiency on chronic EAE remains to be elucidated. We aimed to clarify the roles of Cx30 in chronic neuroinflammation by studying EAE induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 in Cx30 KO mice. We found that Cx30 deficiency improved the clinical symptoms and demyelination of chronic but not acute EAE without influencing CD3+ T cell infiltration. Furthermore, increased ramified microglia in the na\u00efve state and induced earlier and stronger microglial activation in the acute and chronic phases of EAE was observed. These activated microglia had an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as shown by the upregulation of arginase-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the downregulation of nitric oxide synthase 2. In the na\u00efve state, Cx30 deficiency induced modest enlargement of astrocytic processes in the spinal cord gray matter and a partial reduction of Cx43 expression in the spinal cord white matter. These astrocytes in Cx30 KO mice showed earlier and stronger activation during the acute phase of EAE, with upregulated A2 astrocyte markers and a significant decrease in Cx43 in the chronic phases. Spinal cord neurons and axons were more preserved in Cx30 KO mice than in littermates in the chronic phase of EAE. These findings suggest that Cx30 deficiency increased ramified microglia in the CNS in the na\u00efve state and improved chronic EAE through redirecting microglia toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, suggesting a hitherto unknown critical role of astrocytic Cx30 in regulating microglial number and functional state."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves a misdirected immune attack against myelin in the brain and spinal cord, leading to profound neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. While the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis have been widely studied, the suppression mechanisms that lead to the resolution of the autoimmune response are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the C-type lectin receptor macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), usually expressed on tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as a negative regulator of autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation. METHODS: We used in silico, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis to explore the expression and functionality of MGL in human macrophages and microglia, as well as in MS post-mortem tissue. In vitro, we studied the capacity of MGL to mediate apoptosis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-derived T cells and mouse CD4+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated in vivo and ex vivo the immunomodulatory potential of MGL in EAE. RESULTS: MGL plays a critical role in the resolution phase of EAE as MGL1-deficient (Clec10a-/-) mice showed a similar day of onset but experienced a higher clinical score to that of WT littermates. We demonstrate that the mouse ortholog MGL1 induces apoptosis of autoreactive T cells and diminishes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory autoantibodies. Moreover, we show that MGL1 but not MGL2 induces apoptosis of activated mouse CD4+ T cells in vitro. In human settings, we show that MGL expression is increased in active MS lesions and on alternatively activated microglia and macrophages which, in turn, induces the secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, underscoring the clinical relevance of this lectin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a new role of MGL-expressing APCs as an anti-inflammatory mechanism in autoimmune neuroinflammation by dampening pathogenic T and B cell responses, uncovering a novel clue for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies with relevance for in MS clinical applications."

                "abstract": "Current therapies for the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) target inflammation, but do not directly address neuroprotection or lesion repair. Cytokines of the gp130 family regulate survival and differentiation of both neural and immune cells, and we recently identified expression of the family member IL-11 in active MS plaques. In this study, we show that IL-11 regulates the clinical course and neuropathology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a demyelinating model that mimics many of the clinical and pathologic features of MS. Importantly, the effects of IL-11 are achieved via a combination of immunoregulation and direct neuroprotection. IL-11R-alpha-null (IL-11Ralpha(-/-)) mice displayed a significant increase in clinical severity and neuropathology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared with wild-type littermates. Inflammation, demyelination, and oligodendrocyte and neuronal loss were all exacerbated in IL-11Ra(-/-) animals. Conversely, wild-type mice treated with IL-11 displayed milder clinical signs and neuropathology than vehicle-treated controls. In cocultures of murine myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(35-55)-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD11c+ APCs, IL-11 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in T cell-derived effector cytokine production. This effect was generated via modulation of CD11c+ APC-mediated lymphocyte activation, and was associated with a decrease in the size of the CD11c+ cell population. Conversely, IL-11 strongly reduced apoptosis and potentiated mitosis in primary cultures of mouse oligodendrocyte progenitors. Collectively, these data reveal that IL-11 regulates inflammatory demyelination via a unique combination of immunoregulation and neuroprotection. IL-11 signaling may represent a therapeutic avenue to restrict CNS inflammation and potentiate oligodendrocyte survival in autoimmune demyelinating disease."

                "abstract": "We have previously shown that immunodeficient mice exhibit significant facial motoneuron (FMN) loss compared to wild-type (WT) mice after a facial nerve axotomy. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is known as a regulatory cytokine that plays an important role in maintaining the anti-inflammatory environment within the central nervous system (CNS). IL-10 is produced by a number of different cells, including Th2 cells, and may exert an anti-apoptotic action on neurons directly. In the present study, the role of IL-10 in mediating neuroprotection following facial nerve axotomy in Rag-2- and IL-10-deficient mice was investigated. Results indicate that IL-10 is neuroprotective, but CD4+ T cells are not the requisite source of IL-10. In addition, using real-time PCR analysis of laser microdissected brainstem sections, results show that IL-10 mRNA is constitutively expressed in the facial nucleus and that a transient, significant reduction of IL-10 mRNA occurs following axotomy under immunodeficient conditions. Dual labeling immunofluorescence data show, unexpectedly, that the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) is constitutively expressed by facial motoneurons, but is selectively induced in astrocytes within the facial nucleus after axotomy. Thus, a non-CD4+ T cell source of IL-10 is necessary for modulating both glial and neuronal events that mediate neuroprotection of injured motoneurons, but only with the cooperation of CD4+ T cells, providing an avenue of novel investigation into therapeutic approaches to prevent or reverse motoneuron diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."

                "abstract": "Leukocyte entry into the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for immune surveillance but is also the basis for the development of pathologic inflammatory conditions within the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The actin-binding protein, cortactin, in endothelial cells is an important player in regulating the interaction of immune cells with the vascular endothelium. Cortactin has been shown to control the integrity of the endothelial barrier and to support neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro and in vivo in the skin. Here we use cortactin gene-inactivated male and female mice to study the role of this protein in EAE. Inducing EAE by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55) revealed an ameliorated disease course in cortactin gene-deficient female mice compared with WT mice. However, proliferation capacity and expression of IL-17A and IFN\u03b3 by cortactin-deficient and WT splenocytes did not differ, suggesting that the lack of cortactin does not affect induction of the immune response. Rather, cortactin deficiency caused decreased vascular permeability and reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brains and spinal cords of EAE mice. Accordingly, cortactin gene-deficient mice had smaller numbers of proinflammatory cuffs, less extensive demyelination, and reduced expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines within the neural tissue compared with WT littermates. Thus, cortactin contributes to the development of neural inflammation by supporting leukocyte transmigration through the blood-brain barrier and, therefore, represents a potential candidate for targeting CNS autoimmunity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorder, based on the entry of inflammatory leukocytes into the CNS where these cells cause demyelination and neurodegeneration. Here, we use a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and show that gene inactivation of cortactin, an actin binding protein that modulates actin dynamics and branching, protects against neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Leukocyte infiltration into the CNS was inhibited in cortactin-deficient mice, and lack of cortactin in cultured primary brain endothelial cells inhibited leukocyte transmigration. Expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS and induction of vascular permeability were reduced. We conclude that cortactin represents a novel potential target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis."

                "abstract": "Regulation of inflammation in the CNS is essential to prevent irreversible cellular damage that can occur in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated the role of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in regulating CNS inflammation using the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that CNS-derived IL-4 was a critical regulator because mice with a deficiency in IL-4 production in the CNS, but not the periphery, had exacerbated EAE associated with a significant increase in the absolute number of infiltrating inflammatory cells. We also found that CNS-resident microglial cells in both the resting and activated state produced the protein Ym1, which is a marker of alternatively activated macrophages (aaMphis), in an IL-4-dependent manner. This aaMphi phenotype extended to the lack of nitric oxide (NO) production by activated microglial cells, which is a marker of classically activated macrophages. We also show that IL-4 induced the expression of Ym1 in peripheral infiltrating macrophages, which also produce NO. Thus, macrophages that migrate into the CNS exhibit a dual phenotype. These data indicate that IL-4 production in the CNS is essential for controlling autoimmune inflammation by inducing a microglial cell aaMphi phenotype. Macrophages that have undergone alternative activation have been shown to be important in tissue repair; thus, our results suggest a new role for microglial cells in the regulation of inflammation in the CNS."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) acts as a key regulator in central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are an important innate source of IL-17. Both IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and microglia, the major resident immune cells of the brain, are involved in various CNS disorders such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. Also, activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways contributes to CNS damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation and interaction of these cellular and molecular components remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the crosstalk between \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and microglia activated by TLRs in the context of neuronal damage. To this end, co-cultures of IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, neurons, and microglia were analyzed by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, ELISA and multiplex immunoassays. RESULTS: We report here that IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells but not na\u00efve \u03b3\u03b4 T cells induce a dose- and time-dependent decrease of neuronal viability in vitro. While direct stimulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with various TLR ligands did not result in up-regulation of CD69, CD25, or in IL-17 secretion, supernatants of microglia stimulated by ligands specific for TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, or TLR9 induced activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells through IL-1\u03b2 and IL-23, as indicated by up-regulation of CD69 and CD25 and by secretion of vast amounts of IL-17. This effect was dependent on the TLR adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) expressed by both \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and microglia, but did not require the expression of TLRs by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Similarly to cytokine-primed IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells induced by supernatants derived from TLR-activated microglia also caused neurotoxicity in vitro. While these neurotoxic effects required stimulation of TLR2, TLR4, or TLR9 in microglia, neuronal injury mediated by bone marrow-derived macrophages did not require TLR signaling. Neurotoxicity mediated by IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells required a direct cell-cell contact between T cells and neurons. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results point to a crucial role for microglia activated through TLRs in polarization of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells towards neurotoxic IL-17+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells."

We previously showed that CNS-restricted expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent neuroprotective factor, reduced CNS inflammation and clinical deficits associated with EAE. In this study, we demonstrate that systemic HGF treatment ameliorates EAE through the development of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) with high expression levels of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a transcriptional repressor of gene expression and a key endogenous regulator of the inflammatory response. RNA interference-directed neutralization of GILZ expression by DCs suppressed the induction of tolerance caused by HGF. Finally, adoptive transfer of HGF-treated DCs from wild-type but not GILZ gene-deficient mice potently mediated functional recovery in recipient mice with established EAE through effective modulation of autoaggressive T cell responses. Altogether, these results show that by inducing GILZ in DCs, HGF reproduces the mechanism of immune regulation induced by potent immunomodulatory factors such as IL-10, TGF-\u03b21, and glucocorticoids and therefore that HGF therapy may have potential in the treatment of autoimmune dysfunctions.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating neurological disease caused by autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model for the pathogenesis of MS. We and others have previously demonstrated that IL-17 is critical for the pathogenesis of EAE. The concentration of IL-17 is significantly higher in the sera of MS patients than in healthy controls and correlates with disease activity. Moreover, anti-IL-17 neutralizing antibody demonstrated promising efficacy in a phase II trial in MS patients, further substantiating a key pathogenic role for IL-17 in MS. While Th17 and IL-17 are emerging as a bona fide drivers for neuroinflammation, it remains unclear what effector molecule executes the inflammatory tissue destruction in Th17-driven EAE. METHODS: By microarray analysis, we found STEAP4 is a downstream molecule of IL-17 signaling in EAE. We then used STEAP4 global knockout mice and STEAP4 conditional knockout mice to test its role in the pathogenesis of EAE. RESULTS: Here, we report that the metalloreductase, STEAP4, is a key effector molecule that participates and contributes to the pathogenesis of Th17-mediated neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. STEAP4 knockout mice displayed delayed onset and reduced severity of EAE induced by active immunization. The reduced disease phenotype was not due to any impact of STEAP4 deficiency on myelin reactive T cells. In contrast, STEAP4 knockout mice were resistant to passively induced EAE, pointing to a role for STEAP4 in the effector stage of EAE. Notably, STEAP4 was only induced the spinal cord of EAE mice that received Th17 cells but not Th1 cells. Consistently, STEAP4 deficiency protected from only Th17 but not Th1-induced EAE. Finally, using Nestin-Cre STEAP4fl/fl mice, we showed that ablation of STEAP4 expression in the resident cells in the central nervous system attenuated disease severity in both active immunization and passive Th17 transfer-induced EAE. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified STEAP4 as a Th17-specific effector molecule that participates and contributes to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation, thus potentially provide a novel target for MS therapy."

Using floxed-reporter Ch25h knock-in mice, we trace Ch25h expression to CNS endothelial cells (ECs) and myeloid cells and demonstrate that Ch25h ablation specifically from ECs attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mechanistically, inflamed Ch25h-deficient CNS ECs display altered lipid metabolism favoring polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) expansion, which suppresses encephalitogenic T\u00a0lymphocyte proliferation. Additionally, endothelial Ch25h-deficiency combined with immature neutrophil mobilization into the blood circulation nearly completely protects mice from EAE.

P38 regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) deficiency can cause functional disorders in neutrophils and macrophages under high oxidative stress, but the precise mechanisms by which PRAK regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination and its potential impact on CD4+ T helper subset function are unclear. The present study reveals that the PRAK-NF-E2-related factor 2(NRF2) axis is essential for maintaining the intracellular redox homeostasis of T helper 17(Th17) cells, thereby promoting Th17 cell differentiation and antitumor effects. Through mechanistic analysis, we identify NRF2 as a novel protein substrate of PRAK and find that PRAK enhances the stability of the NRF2 protein through phosphorylation NRF2 Serine(S) 558 independent of protein ubiquitination. High accumulation of cellular ROS caused by loss of PRAK disrupts both glycolysis and PKM2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3, which subsequently impairs the differentiation of Th17 cells. As a result, Prak knockout (KO) mice display significant resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but impaired antitumor immunity in a MC38 tumor model. This work reveals that the PRAK-NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway is a metabolic checkpoint that controls Th17-cell glycolysis and differentiation. Targeting PRAK is a promising strategy for maintaining an active ROS scavenging system and may lead to potent Th17 cell antitumor immunity."

Nrf2 has been shown to protect several types of cells against the acute and chronic injury that accompanies oxidative stress, but its role in osteoclasts remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in osteoclast (OC) differentiation, a process in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated and then participate, using Nrf2-knockout mice. Receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced OC differentiation, actin ring formation, and osteoclastic bone resorption were substantially promoted in Nrf2-deficient OC precursor cells compared to wild-type cells. Under both unstimulated and RANKL-stimulated conditions, Nrf2 loss led to an increase in the intracellular ROS level and the oxidized-to-reduced glutathione ratio and a defect in the production of numerous antioxidant enzymes and glutathione. Moreover, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine or diphenyleneiodonium significantly reduced the OC differentiation and decreased the intracellular ROS level in both Nrf2-deficient and wild-type cells. Pretreatment with sulforaphane and curcumin also inhibited the OC differentiation by activating Nrf2 in part. Nrf2 deficiency promoted the RANKL-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38; the induction of c-Fos; and the consequent induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1, a pivotal determinant of OC differentiation. Our results suggest that Nrf2 probably inhibits RANKL-induced OC differentiation by regulating the cellular redox status by controlling the expression of oxidative response genes, findings that might form the basis of a new strategy for treating inflammatory bone diseases.

In this study, we demonstrate that the germinal center kinase family member MINK1 (misshapen/NIK-related kinase 1) negatively regulates Th17 cell differentiation. The suppressive effect of MINK1 on induction of Th17 cells is mediated by the inhibition of SMAD2 activation through direct phosphorylation of SMAD2 at the T324 residue. The importance of MINK1 to Th17 cell differentiation was strengthened in the animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Moreover, we show that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl cysteine boosts Th17 cell differentiation in a MINK1-dependent manner and exacerbates the severity of EAE. Thus, we have not only established MINK1 as a critical regulator of Th17 cell differentiation, but also clarified that accumulation of ROS may limit the generation of Th17 cells.

However, the mechanism underlying the development of inflammation is unclear. In our study, LKB1-deficient T cells were differentiated preferentially into Th1 and Th17 cells in the absence of inflammation. Mechanistically, LKB1 directly binds and phosphorylates phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), an upstream regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is independent of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

                "abstract": "Cancer-initiating cells (CICs) are responsible for tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance; moreover, redox homeostasis is important in regulating cancer stemness. Previously, we have identified that cancer cells containing low intracellular reactive oxygen species levels (ROSLow cells) display enhanced features of CICs. However, the specific metabolic signatures of CICs remain unclear and are required for further characterization by systemic screenings. Herein, we first showed CICs mainly relying on glycolysis that was important for the maintenance of stemness properties. Next, we revealed that NRF2, a master regulator of antioxidants, was able to maintain low intracellular ROS levels of CICs, even though in the absence of oxidative stress. We further characterized that NRF2 activation was required for the maintenance of CICs properties. Of ROSLow cells, NRF2 activation not only directly activates the transcription of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes but also inhibited the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by directly activating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) to lead to inhibition of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; therefore, to promote Warburg effect. A positive regulatory ROS-independent ER stress pathway (GRP78/p-PERK/NRF2 signaling) was identified to mediate the metabolic shift (Warburg effect) and stemness of CICs. Lastly, co-expression of p-PERK and p-NRF2 was significantly associated with the clinical outcome. Our data show that NRF2 acting as a central node in the maintenance of low ROS levels and stemness associated properties of the CICs, which is significantly associated with the clinical outcome, but independent from ROS stress. Future treatments by inhibiting NRF2 activation may exhibit great potential in targeting CICs."

                "title": "Mechanisms of activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 by redox stressors, nutrient cues, and energy status and the pathways through which it attenuates degenerative disease.",
                "abstract": "Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the basal and stress-inducible expression of a battery of genes encoding key components of the glutathione-based and thioredoxin-based antioxidant systems, as well as aldo-keto reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 drug-metabolizing isoenzymes along with multidrug-resistance-associated efflux pumps. It therefore plays a pivotal role in both intrinsic resistance and cellular adaptation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and xenobiotics. Activation of Nrf2 can, however, serve as a double-edged sword because some of the genes it induces may contribute to chemical carcinogenesis by promoting futile redox cycling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites or confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by increasing the expression of efflux pumps, suggesting its cytoprotective effects will vary in a context-specific fashion. In addition to cytoprotection, Nrf2 also controls genes involved in intermediary metabolism, positively regulating those involved in NADPH generation, purine biosynthesis, and the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, while suppressing those involved in lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Nrf2 is subject to regulation at multiple levels. Its ability to orchestrate adaptation to oxidants and electrophiles is due principally to stress-stimulated modification of thiols within one of its repressors, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is present in the cullin-3 RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex CRLKeap1. Thus modification of Cys residues in Keap1 blocks CRLKeap1 activity, allowing newly translated Nrf2 to accumulate rapidly and induce its target genes. The ability of Keap1 to repress Nrf2 can be attenuated by p62/sequestosome-1 in a mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent manner, thereby allowing refeeding after fasting to increase Nrf2-target gene expression. In parallel with repression by Keap1, Nrf2 is also repressed by \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein (\u03b2-TrCP), present in the Skp1-cullin-1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex SCF\u03b2-TrCP. The ability of SCF\u03b2-TrCP to suppress Nrf2 activity is itself enhanced by prior phosphorylation of the transcription factor by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through formation of a DSGIS-containing phosphodegron. However, formation of the phosphodegron in Nrf2 by GSK-3 is inhibited by stimuli that activate protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. In particular, PKB/Akt activity can be increased by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mTORC2, thereby providing an explanation of why antioxidant-responsive element-driven genes are induced by growth factors and nutrients. Thus Nrf2 activity is tightly controlled via CRLKeap1 and SCF\u03b2-TrCP by oxidative stress and energy-based signals, allowing it to mediate adaptive responses that restore redox homeostasis and modulate intermediary metabolism. Based on the fact that Nrf2 influences multiple biochemical pathways in both positive and negative ways, it is likely its dose-response curve, in terms of susceptibility to certain degenerative disease, is U-shaped. Specifically, too little Nrf2 activity will lead to loss of cytoprotection, diminished antioxidant capacity, and lowered \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, while conversely also exhibiting heightened sensitivity to ROS-based signaling that involves receptor tyrosine kinases and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1. By contrast, too much Nrf2 activity disturbs the homeostatic balance in favor of reduction, and so may have deleterious consequences including overproduction of reduced glutathione and NADPH, the blunting of ROS-based signal transduction, epithelial cell hyperplasia, and failure of certain cell types to differentiate correctly. We discuss the basis of a putative U-shaped Nrf2 dose-response curve in terms of potentially competing processes relevant to different stages of tumorigenesis."

                "abstract": "Targeting glycolysis has been considered therapeutically intractable owing to its essential housekeeping role. However, the context-dependent requirement for individual glycolytic steps has not been fully explored. We show that CRISPR-mediated targeting of glycolysis in T\u00a0cells in mice results in global loss of Th17 cells, whereas deficiency of the glycolytic enzyme glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi1) selectively eliminates inflammatory encephalitogenic and colitogenic Th17 cells, without substantially affecting homeostatic microbiota-specific Th17 cells. In homeostatic Th17 cells, partial blockade of glycolysis upon Gpi1 inactivation was compensated by pentose phosphate pathway flux and increased mitochondrial respiration. In contrast, inflammatory Th17 cells experience a hypoxic microenvironment known to limit mitochondrial respiration, which is incompatible with loss of Gpi1. Our study suggests that inhibiting glycolysis by targeting Gpi1 could be an effective therapeutic strategy with minimum toxicity for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, and, more generally, that metabolic redundancies can be exploited for selective targeting of disease processes."

Here, we show that the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme required for cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression, is a key factor mediating Th17 cell differentiation and autoimmune inflammation. We found that PKM2 is highly expressed throughout the differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) development. Strikingly, PKM2 is not required for the metabolic reprogramming and proliferative capacity of Th17 cells. However, T cell-specific PKM2 deletion impairs Th17 cell differentiation and ameliorates symptoms of EAE by decreasing Th17 cell-mediated inflammation and demyelination. Mechanistically, PKM2 translocates into the nucleus and interacts with STAT3, enhancing its activation and thereby increasing Th17 cell differentiation. Thus, PKM2 acts as a critical nonmetabolic regulator that fine-tunes Th17 cell differentiation and function in autoimmune-mediated inflammation."

                "abstract": "Blood monocytes are recruited to injured tissue sites and differentiate into macrophages, which protect against pathogens and repair damaged tissues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be an important contributor to monocytes' differentiation and macrophages' function. NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor regulating cellular redox homeostasis, is known to be a critical modulator of inflammatory responses. We herein investigated the role of NRF2 in macrophage differentiation using the human monocytic U937 cell line and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). In U937 cells with NRF2 silencing, PMA-stimulated cell adherence was significantly facilitated when compared to control U937 cells. Both transcript and protein levels for pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukine-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) were highly elevated in PMA-stimulated NRF2-silenced U937 compared to the control. In addition, PMA-inducible secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) was significantly high in NRF2-silenced U937. As an underlying mechanism, we showed that NRF2-knockdown U937 retained high levels of cellular ROS and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers expression; and subsequently, PMA-stimulated levels of Ca2+ and PKC\u03b1 were greater in NRF2-knockdown U937 cells, which caused enhanced nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-\u04a1B (NF\u04a1B) p50 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation. Whereas the treatment of NRF2-silenced U937 cells with pharmacological inhibitors of NF\u04a1B or ERK1/2 largely blocked PMA-induced IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 expression, indicating that these pathways are associated with cell differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest that the NRF2 system functions to suppress PMA-stimulated U937 cell differentiation into pro-inflammatory macrophages and provide evidence that the ROS-PKC\u03b1-ERK-NF\u04a1B axis is involved in PMA-facilitated differentiation of NRF2-silenced U937 cells.

Although ubiquitination of TGF-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is critical for NF-\u03baB activation in T cells, the regulation of its deubiquitination is unclear. We show that USP18, which was previously reported to be important in regulating type I interferon signaling in innate immunity, regulates T cell activation and T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation by deubiquitinating the TAK1-TAB1 complex. USP18-deficient T cells are defective in Th17 differentiation and Usp18(-/-) mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In response to T cell receptor engagement, USP18-deficient T cells exhibit hyperactivation of NF-\u03baB and NFAT and produce increased levels of IL-2 compared with the wild-type controls. Importantly, USP18 is associated with and deubiquitinates the TAK1-TAB1 complex, thereby restricting expression of IL-2. Our findings thus demonstrate a previously uncharacterized negative regulation of TAK1 activity during Th17 differentiation, suggesting that USP18 may be targeted to treat autoimmune diseases. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metformin (Met) is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus and plays an effective role in treating various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and aging. However, the underlying mechanism of Met-dependent antitumor immunity remains to be elucidated. METHODS: MitoTEMPO, a scavenger of mitochondrial superoxide, abolished the antitumor effect of Met, but not antiprogrammed cell death (PD-1) antibody (Ab) treatment. Consequently, we studied the mechanism of the Met-induced antitumor effect. Expressions of glucose transporter (Glut)-1, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, Ki67, autophagy markers, activation markers for NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and mammalian target of rapamaycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD8TILs) were examined by flow cytometry analysis. In addition, conditional knockout mice for Nrf2 and p62 were used to detect these markers, together with the monitoring of in vivo tumor growth. RNA sequencing was performed for CD8TILs and tumor cells. Melanoma cells containing an IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN\u03b3R) cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant was overexpressed and used for characterization of the metabolic profile of those tumor cells using a Seahorse Flux Analyzer. RESULTS: Met administration elevates mtROS and cell surface Glut-1, resulting in the production of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8TILs. mtROS activates Nrf2 in a glycolysis-dependent manner, inducing activation of autophagy, glutaminolysis, mTORC1, and p62/SQSTM1. mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of p62 at serine 351 (p-p62(S351)) is also involved in activation of Nrf2. Conditional deletion of Nrf2 in CD8TILs abrogates mTORC1 activation and antitumor immunity by Met. In synergy with the effect of anti-PD-1 Ab, Met boosts CD8TIL proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion, resulting in decreased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells. Consequently, Glut-1 is elevated in CD8TILs, together with the expansion of activated dendritic cells. Moreover, tumor cells lacking in IFN\u03b3R signaling abolish IFN-\u03b3 production and proliferation of CD8TILs. CONCLUSIONS: We found that Met stimulates production of mtROS, which triggers Glut-1 elevation and Nrf2 activation in CD8TILs. Nrf2 activates mTORC1, whereas mTORC1 activates Nrf2 in a p-p62(S351)-dependent manner, thus creating a feedback loop that ensures CD8TILs' proliferation. In combination with anti-PD-1 Ab, Met stimulates robust proliferation of CD8TILs and IFN-\u03b3 secretion, resulting in an IFN-\u03b3-dependent reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment."

Loss of Nrf2 results in increased co-stimulatory molecule expression, enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in murine immature DCs (iDCs). It is unknown whether altered immune function of Nrf2-deficient DCs (Nrf2(-/-) iDCs) is due to elevated ROS levels. Furthermore, it is unclear which intracellular signaling pathways are involved in Nrf2-mediated regulation of DC function. Using antioxidant vitamins to reset ROS levels in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs, we show that elevated ROS is not responsible for the altered phenotype and function of these DCs. Pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the role of key MAPKs in mediating the altered phenotype and function in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs. We demonstrate that the increased co-stimulatory molecule expression (MHC II and CD86) and antigen-specific T cell activation capacity observed in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs was reversed by inhibition of p38 MAPK but not JNK. Importantly, we provide evidence for increased phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), transcription factors that are downstream of p38 MAPK. The increased phosphorylation of CREB/ATF1 in Nrf2(-/-) iDCs was sensitive to p38 MAPK inhibition. We also show data to implicate heme oxygenase-1 as a potential molecular link between Nrf2 and CREB/ATF1. These results indicate that dysregulation of p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 signaling axis underlies the altered function and phenotype in Nrf2-deficient DCs. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Nrf2 mediates regulation of DC function. "

T cell antigen receptor signaling phosphorylates a serine/threonine kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4), and promotes glycolysis. Based on these findings we hypothesized that CaMK4 promotes glycolysis. Camk4-deficient CD4+ T cells and cells treated with a CaMK4 inhibitor had less glycolysis compared with their counterparts. Pull-down of CaMK4 and mass spectrometry identified pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM), the final rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, as a binding partner. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting showed that CaMK4 interacts directly with PKM2. Camk4-deficient CD4+ T cells displayed decreased pyruvate kinase activity. Silencing or pharmacological inhibition of PKM2 reduced glycolysis and in vitro differentiation to Th1 and Th17 cells, while PKM2 overexpression restored Th17 cell differentiation. Treatment with a PKM2 inhibitor ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and CD4+ T cells treated with PKM2 inhibitor or Pkm2-shRNA caused limited disease activity in an adoptive cell transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our data demonstrate that CaMK4 binds to PKM2 and promotes its activity, which is requisite for Th1 and Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

                "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical mediators of immunity and immune tolerance by orchestrating multiple aspects of T cell activation and function. Immature DCs (iDCs) expressing low levels of co-stimulatory receptors are highly efficient at antigen capture but are poor activators of T cells. Maturation of DCs is associated with increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Co-stimulatory receptor gene expression is regulated by intracellular redox, NF-\u03baB, and MAPK pathways and by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The transcription factor, Nrf2, is important for maintaining intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and redox homeostasis and has been implicated in modulating DC co-stimulatory receptor expression. It is unclear whether Nrf2 mediates this effect by GSH-dependent mechanisms and whether it influences DC signaling pathways. Using bone marrow-derived iDCs from Nrf2(+/+) and Nrf2(-/-) mice, we demonstrate that Nrf2(-/-) iDCs have lower basal GSH levels, enhanced co-stimulatory receptor expression, impaired phagocytic functions, and increased antigen-specific CD8 T cell stimulation capacity. Interestingly, lowering GSH levels in Nrf2(+/+) iDCs did not recapitulate the Nrf2(-/-) iDC phenotype. Loss of Nrf2 resulted in elevated basal levels of reactive oxygen species but did not affect basal NF-\u03baB activity or p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that enhanced co-stimulatory receptor phenotype of Nrf2(-/-) iDC does not require ERK activity but is dependent on HDAC activity, indicating a potential interaction between Nrf2 function and HDAC. These results suggest that Nrf2 activity is required to counter rises in intracellular reactive oxygen species and to regulate pathways that control DC co-stimulatory receptor expression."

                "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mutagenic and may thereby promote cancer. Normally, ROS levels are tightly controlled by an inducible antioxidant program that responds to cellular stressors and is predominantly regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2 (also known as Nfe2l2) and its repressor protein Keap1 (refs 2-5). In contrast to the acute physiological regulation of Nrf2, in neoplasia there is evidence for increased basal activation of Nrf2. Indeed, somatic mutations that disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction to stabilize Nrf2 and increase the constitutive transcription of Nrf2 target genes were recently identified, indicating that enhanced ROS detoxification and additional Nrf2 functions may in fact be pro-tumorigenic. Here, we investigated ROS metabolism in primary murine cells following the expression of endogenous oncogenic alleles of Kras, Braf and Myc, and found that ROS are actively suppressed by these oncogenes. K-Ras(G12D), B-Raf(V619E) and Myc(ERT2) each increased the transcription of Nrf2 to stably elevate the basal Nrf2 antioxidant program and thereby lower intracellular ROS and confer a more reduced intracellular environment. Oncogene-directed increased expression of Nrf2 is a new mechanism for the activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant program, and is evident in primary cells and tissues of mice expressing K-Ras(G12D) and B-Raf(V619E), and in human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, genetic targeting of the Nrf2 pathway impairs K-Ras(G12D)-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, the Nrf2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program represents a previously unappreciated mediator of oncogenesis."

Previous studies have shown that a regulatory connection exists between NRF2 and autophagy during reactive oxygen species-generated oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate how autophagy is turned off during prolonged oxidative stress, to avoid overeating and destruction of essential cellular components. AMPK is a key cellular energy sensor highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms, and it has an essential role in autophagy activation at various stress events. Here the role of human AMPK and its Caenorhabditis elegans counterpart AAK-2 was explored upon oxidative stress. We investigated the regulatory connection between NRF2 and AMPK during oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in HEK293T cells and C. elegans. Putative conserved NRF2/protein skinhead-1 binding sites were found in AMPK/aak-2 genes by in silico analysis and were later confirmed experimentally by using EMSA. After addition of TBHP, NRF2 and AMPK showed a quick activation; AMPK was later down-regulated, however, while NRF2 level remained high. Autophagosome formation and Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 phosphorylation were initially stimulated, but they returned to basal values after 4 h of TBHP treatment. The silencing of NRF2 resulted in a constant activation of AMPK leading to hyperactivation of autophagy during oxidative stress. We observed the same effects in C. elegans demonstrating the conservation of this self-defense mechanism to save cells from hyperactivated autophagy upon prolonged oxidative stress. We conclude that NRF2 negatively regulates autophagy through delayed down-regulation of the expression of AMPK upon prolonged oxidative stress. This regulatory connection between NRF2 and AMPK may have an important role in understanding how autophagy is regulated in chronic human morbidities characterized by oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases, certain cancer types, and in metabolic diseases.-Kosztelnik, M., Kurucz, A., Papp, D., Jones, E., Sigmond, T., Barna, J., Traka, M.

However, the precise regulation of myofibroblast transdifferentiation remains largely uncharacterized. RESULTS: In this study, we found that tanshinone IIA (Tan-IIA), an active component in the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, can suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of myofibroblast and reduce extracellular matrix deposition in bleomycin (BLM)-challenged mice through the regulation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Additionally, Tan-IIA restored redox homeostasis by upregulating Nrf2 with NADPH oxidase 4 suppression and effectively prevented myofibroblast activation by blocking ROS-mediated protein kinase C delta (PKC\u03b4)/Smad3 signaling. Nrf2 knockdown in the fibroblasts and the lungs of BLM-treated mice reduced the inhibitory effects of Tan-IIA, indicating the essential role of Nrf2 in the Tan-IIA activity. Tan-IIA impaired the binding of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) to Nrf2 by promoting the degradation of Keap1 and thereby increasing Nrf2 induction by protecting Nrf2 stability against ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, we also found that the glutamate anaplerotic pathway was involved in energy generation and biosynthesis in activated myofibroblasts and their proliferation. Tan-IIA shunted glutaminolysis into glutathione (GSH) production by activating Nrf2, resulting in the reduction of glutamate availability for tricarboxylic acid cycle. Ultimately, myofibroblast activation was prevented by impairing cell proliferation. Innovation and Conclusion: In addition to the regulation of redox homeostasis, our work showed that Tan-IIA activated Nrf2/GSH signaling pathway to limit glutaminolysis in myofibroblast proliferation, which provided further insight into the critical function of Nrf2 in PF."

CD28, but not IL-2, repression of Th17 development was dependent on c-Rel, implicating a dual role for c-Rel in modulating Th17 development. Adoptive transfer experiments also suggested that c-Rel control of regulatory T cell differentiation and homeostasis influences EAE development and severity by influencing the balance between Th17 and regulatory T cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that in addition to promoting Th1 differentiation, c-Rel regulates the development and severity of EAE via multiple mechanisms that impact on the generation of Th17 cells."

                "abstract": "DCs are able to undergo rapid maturation, which subsequently allows them to initiate and orchestrate T cell-driven immune responses. DC maturation must be tightly controlled in order to avoid random T cell activation and development of autoimmunity. Here, we determined that 12/15-lipoxygenase-meditated (12/15-LO-mediated) enzymatic lipid oxidation regulates DC activation and fine-tunes consecutive T cell responses. Specifically, 12/15-LO activity determined the DC activation threshold via generation of phospholipid oxidation products that induced an antioxidative response dependent on the transcription factor NRF2. Deletion of the 12/15-LO-encoding gene or pharmacologic inhibition of 12/15-LO in murine or human DCs accelerated maturation and shifted the cytokine profile, thereby favoring the differentiation of Th17 cells. Exposure of 12/15-LO-deficient DCs to 12/15-LO-derived oxidized phospholipids attenuated both DC activation and the development of Th17 cells. Analysis of lymphatic tissues from 12/15-LO-deficient mice confirmed enhanced maturation of DCs as well as an increased differentiation of Th17 cells. Moreover, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice lacking 12/15-LO resulted in an exacerbated Th17-driven autoimmune disease. Together, our data reveal that 12/15-LO controls maturation of DCs and implicate enzymatic lipid oxidation in shaping the adaptive immune response. "

                "abstract": "AIMS: The H19 lncRNA, a highly abundant and conserved imprinted gene, has been implicated in many essential biological processes and diseases. However, the function of H19 in the heart remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the function and underlying mechanism of H19 in regulating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We first detected the expression of H19 and its encoded miR-675 in both normal and diseased hearts and verified their up-regulations in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Adenovirus-mediated expression and a siRNA-mediated silence of H19 showed that H19 overexpression reduced cell size both at baseline and in response to phenylephrine, whereas knock-down of H19 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Overexpression or knock-down of miR-675 in cardiomyocytes demonstrated that miR-675 also inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, inhibition of miR-675 reversed the reduction of cardiomyocyte size in H19-overexpressing cardiomyocytes, while infection with an adenovirus carrying H19 fragment without pre-miR-675 (H19-Tru) or with mutant sequences of pre-miR-675 (H19-Mut) failed to reduce cardiomyocyte size, indicating that miR-675 mediated the inhibitory effect of H19 on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We also identified that CaMKII\u03b4 was a direct target of miR-675 and partially mediated the effect of H19 on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, in vivo silencing of miR-675 using a specific antagomir in a pressure overload-induced mouse model of heart failure increased cardiac CaMKII\u03b4 expression and exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal a novel function of H19-miR-675 axis targeting CaMKII\u03b4 as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting its potential therapeutic role in cardiac diseases."

However, the effects of METRNL on pathological cardiac hypertrophy is still unknown. In the present study, we used a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to mimic pathological cardiac hypertrophy and gene delivery system to overexpress METRNL in vivo. The results showed that METRNL overexpression improved TAC-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice and neonatal cardiomyocytes. In addition, METRNL overexpression diminished TAC-induced cardiac oxidative damage, inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Moreover, the cardioprotective effect of METRNL overexpression was directly related to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin1 (SIRT1). In summary, our data identified that METRNL may be a promising therapeutic target to mitigate pathological cardiac hypertrophy in the future."

Growth/differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 family member, is a regulator of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues. Evidence from human and animal studies suggests that GDF1 may play an important role in cardiac physiology and pathology. However, a critical role for GDF1 in cardiac remodelling has not been investigated. Here, we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies using cardiac-specific GDF1 knockout mice and transgenic mice to determine the role of GDF1 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which was induced by aortic banding (AB). The extent of cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by echocardiographic, hemodynamic, pathological, and molecular analyses. Our results demonstrated that cardiac specific GDF1 overexpression in the heart markedly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction, whereas loss of GDF1 in cardiomyocytes exaggerated the pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in response to pressure overload. Mechanistically, we revealed that the cardioprotective effect of GDF1 on cardiac remodeling was associated with the inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 and Smad signaling cascades. Collectively, our data suggest that GDF1 plays a protective role in cardiac remodeling via the negative regulation of the MEK-ERK1/2 and Smad signaling pathways. "

However, the contribution of different Ras isoforms has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to define the role of H- and K-Ras in modulating stress-induced myocardial hypertrophy and failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used H- and K-Ras gene knockout mice and subjected them to pressure overload to induce cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. We observed a worsened cardiac phenotype in Hras-/- mice, while outcomes were improved in Kras+/- mice. We also used a neonatal rat cardiomyocyte culture system to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations. Our findings demonstrate that H-Ras, but not K-Ras, promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy both in vivo and in vitro. This response was mediated in part through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT signaling pathway. Adeno-associated virus-mediated increase in AKT activation improved the cardiac function in pressure overloaded Hras null hearts in vivo. These findings further support engagement of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT signaling axis by H-Ras. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings indicate that H- and K-Ras have divergent effects on cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in response to pressure overload stress."

Expression of miR-99a was evaluated in these hypertrophic cells and hearts.

As a typical multi-domain member of the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) family, RGS12 plays a regulatory role in various signaling pathways. However, the precise effect of RGS12 on cardiac hypertrophy remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed increased expression of RGS12 in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We then generated genetically engineered mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to investigate the effects of RGS12 during this pathological process. Four weeks after aortic banding, RGS12-deficient hearts showed decreased cardiomyocyte cross area (374.7\u00b143.2 \u03bcm(2) versus 487.1\u00b147.9 \u03bcm(2) in controls; P<0.05) with preserved fractional shortening (43.0\u00b13.4% versus 28.4\u00b12.2% in controls; P<0.05), whereas RGS12-overexpressing hearts exhibited increased cardiomyocyte cross area (582.4\u00b146.7 \u03bcm(2) versus 474.8\u00b140.0 \u03bcm(2) in controls; P<0.05) and reduced fractional shortening (20.8\u00b14.1% versus 28.6\u00b13.2% in controls; P<0.05). RGS12 also contributed to angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy in isolated cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, our data indicated that the activation of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling may be responsible for the prohypertrophic action of RGS12. In addition, the requirement of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling for RGS12-mediated cardiac hypertrophy was confirmed in rescue experiments using the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126. In conclusion, our findings provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."

Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of USP18 in mice significantly blunted cardiac remodeling as evidenced by mitigated myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, ventricular dilation, and preserved ejection function, whereas USP18-deficient mice displayed exacerbated cardiac remodeling under the same pathological stimuli. Similar results were observed for in vitro angiotensin II-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

This study examined the role of cardiomyocyte DDT in the setting of heart failure. Patients with advanced heart failure undergoing transplantation demonstrated decreased cardiac DDT expression. To understand the effect of loss of cardiac DDT in experimental heart failure, cardiomyocyte-specific DDT-KO (DDT-cKO) and littermate control mice underwent surgical transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac pressure overload. DDT-cKO mice developed more rapid cardiac contractile dysfunction, greater cardiac dilatation, and pulmonary edema after TAC. Cardiomyocytes from DDT-cKO mice after TAC had impaired contractility, calcium transients, and reduced expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. The DDT-cKO hearts also exhibited diminished angiogenesis with reduced capillary density and lower VEGF-A expression after TAC. In pharmacological studies, recombinant DDT (rDDT) activated endothelial cell ERK1/2 and Akt signaling and had proangiogenic effects in vitro. The DDT-cKO hearts also demonstrated more interstitial fibrosis with enhanced collagen and connective tissue growth factor expression after TAC. In cardiac fibroblasts, rDDT had an antifibrotic action by inhibiting TGF-\u03b2-induced Smad-2 activation.

Although ADAM23 is expressed in the heart, the role of ADAM23 in the heart and in cardiac diseases remains unknown. Methods and Results We observed that ADAM23 expression is decreased in both failing human hearts and hypertrophic mice hearts. Cardiac-specific conditional ADAM23-knockout mice significantly exhibited exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing ADAM23 in the heart exhibited reduced cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload.

Although hypertrophy is traditionally regarded as an adaptive response to physiological or pathological stress, prolonged hypertrophy can lead to heart failure.

Cardiac-specific deletion of Prdm16 results in cardiac hypertrophy, excessive ventricular fibrosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired metabolic flexibility, leading to heart failure. We demonstrate that Prdm16 and euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase factors (Ehmts) act together to reduce expression of fetal genes reactivated in pathological hypertrophy by inhibiting the functions of the pro-hypertrophic transcription factor Myc. Although young Prdm16 knockout mice show normal cardiac function, they are predisposed to develop heart failure in response to metabolic stress.

Echocardiography, pathological and molecular analysis were used to determine the extent of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, dysfunction and inflammation.

The extent of TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, dysfunction and inflammation in USP19-knockout mice was exacerbated. Consistently, gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches that involved USP19 in cardiomyocytes suggested that the down-regulation of USP19 promoted the hypertrophic phenotype, while the up-regulation of USP19 improved the worsened phenotype. Mechanistically, the USP19-elicited cardiac hypertrophy improvement was attributed to the abrogation of the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-p38/JNK1/2 transduction. Furthermore, the inhibition of TAK1 abolished the aggravated hypertrophy induced by the loss of USP19.

However, the role of endogenous CITED4 in response to physiological or pathological stress is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of CITED4 in murine models of exercise and pressure overload. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated cardiomyocyte-specific CITED4 knockout mice (C4KO) and subjected them to an intensive swim exercise protocol as well as transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Echocardiography, Western blotting, qPCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and transcriptional profiling for mRNA and miRNA (microRNA) expression were performed. Cellular crosstalk was investigated in vitro. CITED4 deletion in cardiomyocytes did not affect baseline cardiac size or function in young adult mice. C4KO mice developed modest cardiac dysfunction and dilation in response to exercise. After TAC, C4KOs developed severe heart failure with left ventricular dilation, impaired cardiomyocyte growth accompanied by reduced mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activity and maladaptive cardiac remodeling with increased apoptosis, autophagy, and impaired mitochondrial signaling. Interstitial fibrosis was markedly increased in C4KO hearts after TAC. RNAseq revealed induction of a profibrotic miRNA network. miR30d was decreased in C4KO hearts after TAC and mediated crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts to modulate fibrosis. miR30d inhibition was sufficient to increase cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis after TAC. CONCLUSIONS: CITED4 protects against pathological cardiac remodeling by regulating mTOR activity and a network of miRNAs mediating cardiomyocyte to fibroblast crosstalk. Our findings highlight the importance of CITED4 in response to both physiological and pathological stimuli."

                "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that loss of CD36 protects the heart from dysfunction induced by pressure overload in the presence of diet-induced insulin resistance and/or obesity. The beneficial effects of CD36 ablation in this context are mediated by preventing excessive cardiac fatty acid (FA) entry and reducing lipotoxic injury. However, whether or not the loss of CD36 can prevent pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction in the absence of chronic exposure to high circulating FAs is presently unknown. To address this, we utilized a tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific CD36 knockout (icCD36KO) mouse and genetically deleted CD36 in adulthood. Control mice (CD36 floxed/floxed mice) and icCD36KO mice were treated with tamoxifen and subsequently subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to generate pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Consistent with CD36 mediating a significant proportion of FA entry into the cardiomyocyte and subsequent FA utilization for ATP production, hearts from icCD36KO mice were metabolically inefficient and displayed signs of energetic stress, including activation of the energetic stress kinase, AMPK. In addition, impaired energetics in icCD36KO mice contributed to a rapid progression from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure. However, icCD36KO mice fed a medium-chain FA diet, whereby medium-chain FAs can enter into the cardiomyocyte independent from CD36, were protected from TAC-induced heart failure. Together these data suggest that limiting FA uptake and partial inhibition of FA oxidation in the heart via CD36 ablation may be detrimental for the compensated hypertrophic heart in the absence of sufficiently elevated circulating FAs to provide an adequate energy source.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Limiting CD36-mediated fatty acid uptake in the setting of obesity and/or insulin resistance protects the heart from cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. However, cardiomyocyte-specific CD36 ablation in the absence of elevated circulating fatty acid levels accelerates the progression of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy to systolic heart failure."

                "abstract": "G protein-regulated cell function is crucial for cardiomyocytes, and any deregulation of its gene expression or protein modification can lead to pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Herein, we report that protein prenylation, a lipidic modification of G proteins that facilitates their association with the cell membrane, might control the process of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We found that geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS), a key enzyme involved in protein prenylation, played a critical role in postnatal heart growth by regulating cardiomyocyte size. Cardiac-specific knockout of GGPPS in mice led to spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy, beginning from week 4, accompanied by the persistent enlargement of cardiomyocytes. This hypertrophic effect occurred by altered prenylation of G proteins. Evaluation of the prenylation, membrane association and hydrophobicity showed that Rheb was hyperactivated and increased mTORC1 signalling pathway after GGPPS deletion. Protein farnesylation or mTORC1 inhibition blocked GGPPS knockdown-induced mTORC1 activation and suppressed the larger neonatal rat ventricle myocyte size and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo, demonstrating a central role of the FPP-Rheb-mTORC1 axis for GGPPS deficiency-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The sustained cardiomyocyte hypertrophy progressively provoked cardiac decompensation and dysfunction, ultimately causing heart failure and adult death. Importantly, GGPPS was down-regulated in the hypertrophic hearts of mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and in failing human hearts. Moreover, HPLC-MS/MS detection revealed that the myocardial farnesyl diphosphate (FPP):geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) ratio was enhanced after pressure overload. Our observations conclude that the alteration of protein prenylation promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth, which acts as a potential cause for pathogenesis of heart failure and may provide a new molecular target for hypertrophic heart disease clinical therapy."

                "abstract": "The nuclear receptor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-\u03b1 (ROR\u03b1) regulates numerous critical biological processes, including central nervous system development, lymphocyte differentiation, and lipid metabolism. ROR\u03b1 has been recently identified in the heart, but very little is known about its role in cardiac physiology. We sought to determine whether ROR\u03b1 regulates myocardial hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte survival in the context of angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulation. For in vivo characterization of the function of ROR\u03b1 in the context of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, we used the \"staggerer\" (ROR\u03b1sg/sg) mouse, which harbors a germline mutation encoding a truncated and globally nonfunctional ROR\u03b1. ROR\u03b1sg/sg and wild-type littermate mice were infused with ANG II or vehicle for 14 days. For in vitro experiments, we overexpressed or silenced ROR\u03b1 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and human cardiac fibroblasts exposed to ANG II. ROR\u03b1sg/sg mice developed exaggerated myocardial hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction after ANG II treatment. In vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments were consistent with the discovery that ROR\u03b1 inhibits ANG II-induced pathological hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte death in vivo. ROR\u03b1 directly repressed IL-6 transcription. Loss of ROR\u03b1 function led to enhanced IL-6 expression, proinflammatory STAT3 activation (phopho-STAT3 Tyr705), and decreased mitochondrial number and function, oxidative stress, hypertrophy, and death of cardiomyocytes upon ANG II exposure. ROR\u03b1 was less abundant in failing compared with nonfailing human heart tissue. In conclusion, ROR\u03b1 protects against ANG II-mediated pathological hypertrophy and heart failure by suppressing the IL-6-STAT3 pathway and enhancing mitochondrial function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mice lacking retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-\u03b1 (ROR\u03b1) develop exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy after angiotensin II infusion. Loss of ROR\u03b1 leads to enhanced IL-6 expression and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. ROR\u03b1 maintains mitochondrial function and reduces oxidative stress after angiotensin II. The abundance of ROR\u03b1 is reduced in failing mouse and human hearts."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy increases the risk of developing heart failure and cardiovascular death. The neutrophil inflammatory protein, lipocalin-2 (LCN2/NGAL), is elevated in certain forms of cardiac hypertrophy and acute heart failure. However, a specific role for LCN2 in predisposition and etiology of hypertrophy and the relevant genetic determinants are unclear. Here, we defined the role of LCN2 in concentric cardiac hypertrophy in terms of pathophysiology, inflammatory expression networks, and genomic determinants. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 3 experimental models: a polygenic model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, a model of intrauterine growth restriction and Lcn2-knockout mouse; cultured cardiomyocytes; and 2 human cohorts: 114 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 2064 healthy subjects of the YFS (Young Finns Study). In hypertrophic heart rats, cardiac and circulating Lcn2 was significantly overexpressed before, during, and after development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Lcn2 expression was increased in hypertrophic hearts in a model of intrauterine growth restriction, whereas Lcn2-knockout mice had smaller hearts. In cultured cardiomyocytes, Lcn2 activated molecular hypertrophic pathways and increased cell size, but reduced proliferation and cell numbers. Increased LCN2 was associated with cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. In the YFS, LCN2 expression was associated with body mass index and cardiac mass and with levels of inflammatory markers. The single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs13297295, located near LCN2 defined a significant cis-eQTL for LCN2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Direct effects of LCN2 on cardiomyocyte size and number and the consistent associations in experimental and human analyses reveal a central role for LCN2 in the ontogeny of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure triggered by chronic hypertension represent major challenges for cardiovascular research. Beyond neurohormonal and myocyte signaling pathways, growing evidence suggests inflammatory signaling pathways as therapeutically targetable contributors to this process. We recently reported that microRNA-155 is a key mediator of cardiac inflammation and injury in infectious myocarditis. Here, we investigated the impact of microRNA-155 manipulation in hypertensive heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of the leukocyte-expressed microRNA-155 in mice markedly reduced cardiac inflammation, hypertrophy, and dysfunction on pressure overload. These alterations were macrophage dependent because in vivo cardiomyocyte-specific microRNA-155 manipulation did not affect cardiac hypertrophy or dysfunction, whereas bone marrow transplantation from wild-type mice into microRNA-155 knockout animals rescued the hypertrophic response of the cardiomyocytes and vice versa. In vitro, media from microRNA-155 knockout macrophages blocked the hypertrophic growth of stimulated cardiomyocytes, confirming that macrophages influence myocyte growth in a microRNA-155-dependent paracrine manner. These effects were at least partly mediated by the direct microRNA-155 target suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (Socs1) because Socs1 knockdown in microRNA-155 knockout macrophages largely restored their hypertrophy-stimulating potency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that microRNA-155 expression in macrophages promotes cardiac inflammation, hypertrophy, and failure in response to pressure overload. These data support the causative significance of inflammatory signaling in hypertrophic heart disease and demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic microRNA targeting of inflammation in heart failure."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure, which is characterized by cardiac remodelling, is one of the most common chronic diseases in the aged. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) acts as an indispensable molecule modulating immune response and inflammation in many diseases. However, the effects of STING on cardiomyopathy, especially cardiac remodelling are still largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate whether STING could affect cardiac remodelling and to explore the potential mechanisms. METHODS: In vivo, aortic binding (AB) surgery was performed to construct the mice model of cardiac remodelling. A DNA microinjection system was used to trigger STING overexpression in mice. The STING mRNA and protein expression levels in mice heart were measured, and the cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation and cardiac function were also evaluated. In vitro, cardiomyocytes stimulated by Ang II and cardiac fibroblasts stimulated by TGF-\u03b2 to performed to further study effects of STING on cardiac hypertrophy and fibroblast. In terms of mechanisms, the level of autophagy was detected in mice challenged with AB. Rapamycin, a canonical autophagy inducer, intraperitoneal injected into mice to study possible potential pathway. RESULTS: In vivo, the STING mRNA and protein expression levels in mice heart challenged with AB for 6\u00a0weeks were significantly increased. STING overexpression significantly mitigated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and inflammation, apart from improving cardiac function. In vitro, experiments further disclosed that STING overexpression in cardiomyocytes induced by Ang II significantly inhibited the level of cardiomyocyte cross-section area and the ANP mRNA. Meanwhile, TGF-\u03b2-induced the increase of \u03b1-SMA content and collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts could be also blocked by STING overexpression. In terms of mechanisms, mice challenged with AB showed higher level of autophagy compared with the normal mice. However, STING overexpression could reverse the activation of autophagy triggered by AB. Rapamycin, a canonical autophagy inducer, offset the cardioprotective effects of STING in mice challenged with AB. Finally, further experiments unveiled that STING may inhibit autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 on serine757. CONCLUSIONS: STING may prevent cardiac remodelling induced by pressure overload by inhibiting autophagy, which could be a promising therapeutic target in heart failure. Video Abstract."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that inflammation is closely related to the occurrence and development of heart failure (HF). As an inflammation-related cytokine, interleukin (IL)-9 has been reported to be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of IL-9 in HF in response to isoproterenol (ISO) stimulation has barely been explored. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether IL-9 participates in HF and the possible associated mechanisms. METHODS: Chronic ISO infusion was used to establish an HF model, and the IL-9 levels in mice and isolated cardiomyocytes were measured. In addition, ISO-treated mice received an injection of recombinant mouse IL-9 (rIL-9) or an antimouse IL-9 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) to investigate the effects of IL-9 on cardiac function, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. RESULTS: IL-9 levels were significantly increased in mice and isolated cardiomyocytes after ISO treatment. Treatment with rIL-9 resulted in aggravated cardiac dysfunction and amplified cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, whereas treatment with the anti-IL-9 neutralizing mAb ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in ISO-treated mice. In addition, ISO infusion-induced cardiac inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was aggravated by rIL-9 but prevented by the anti-IL-9 mAb. IL-9 did not activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 or STAT5 but induced STAT3 phosphorylation in ISO-induced HF. Moreover, S31-201, a specific STAT3 inhibitor, nearly abolished rIL-9-induced increases in cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in response to ISO stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: IL-9 aggravated cardiac dysfunction and amplified cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in the ISO-induced HF model by activating STAT3 signalling. These data indicate that blocking IL-9 may be an attractive pharmacotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by chronic \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation to limit the progression of HF."

Therefore, an in-depth study of cardiac heterogeneity and cell-to-cell interactions can help elucidate the pathogenesis of diabetic myocardial fibrosis and identify treatment targets for the treatment of this disease. In this study, we investigated intercellular communication drivers of myocardial fibrosis in mouse heart with high-fat-diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetes at single-cell resolution. Intercellular and protein-protein interaction networks of fibroblasts and macrophages, endothelial cells, as well as fibroblasts and epicardial cells revealed critical changes in ligand-receptor interactions such as Pdgf(s)-Pdgfra and Efemp1-Egfr, which promote the development of a profibrotic microenvironment during the progression of and confirmed that the specific inhibition of the Pdgfra axis could significantly improve diabetic myocardial fibrosis. We also identified phenotypically distinct Hrchi and Postnhi fibroblast subpopulations associated with pathological extracellular matrix remodeling, of which the Hrchi fibroblasts were found to be the most profibrogenic under diabetic conditions. Finally, we validated the role of the Itgb1 hub gene-mediated intercellular communication drivers of diabetic myocardial fibrosis in Hrchi fibroblasts, and confirmed the results through AAV9-mediated Itgb1 knockdown in the heart of diabetic mice. In summary, cardiac cell mapping provides novel insights into intercellular communication drivers involved in pathological extracellular matrix remodeling during diabetic myocardial fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac fibrosis is a key antecedent to many types of cardiac dysfunction including heart failure. Physiological factors leading to cardiac fibrosis have been recognized for decades. However, the specific cellular and molecular mediators that drive cardiac fibrosis, and the relative effect of disparate cell populations on cardiac fibrosis, remain unclear. METHODS: We developed a novel cardiac single-cell transcriptomic strategy to characterize the cardiac cellulome, the network of cells that forms the heart. This method was used to profile the cardiac cellular ecosystem in response to 2 weeks of continuous administration of angiotensin II, a profibrotic stimulus that drives pathological cardiac remodeling. RESULTS: Our analysis provides a comprehensive map of the cardiac cellular landscape uncovering multiple cell populations that contribute to pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix of the heart. Two phenotypically distinct fibroblast populations, Fibroblast-Cilp and Fibroblast-Thbs4, emerged after induction of tissue stress to promote fibrosis in the absence of smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts, a key profibrotic cell population. After angiotensin II treatment, Fibroblast-Cilp develops as the most abundant fibroblast subpopulation and the predominant fibrogenic cell type. Mapping intercellular communication networks within the heart, we identified key intercellular trophic relationships and shifts in cellular communication after angiotensin II treatment that promote the development of a profibrotic cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, the cellular responses to angiotensin II and the relative abundance of fibrogenic cells were sexually dimorphic. CONCLUSIONS: These results offer a valuable resource for exploring the cardiac cellular landscape in health and after chronic cardiovascular stress. These data provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote pathological remodeling of the mammalian heart, highlighting early transcriptional changes that precede chronic cardiac fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global health problem whose common complication is diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by chronic inflammation of the heart muscle. Macrophages are the main white blood cells found in the resting heart. Therefore, we investigated the underling mechanism of macrophage on myocardial fibrosis in diabetes. METHODS: Here, echocardiography was utilized to evaluate cardiac function, and the degree of myocardial fibrosis was assessed using Masson's trichrome staining, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the phenotype, function, developmental trajectory, and interactions between immune cells, endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts (FBs) in the hearts of db/db mice at different stages of diabetes. Macrophages and cardiac fibroblasts were also co-cultured in order to study the signaling between macrophages and fibroblasts. RESULTS: We found that with the development of diabetes mellitus, myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis occurred that was accompanied by cardiac dysfunction. A significant proportion of immune cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts were identified by RNA sequencing. The most significant changes observed were in macrophages, which undergo M1 polarization and are critical for oxidative stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. We further found that M1 macrophages secreted interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), which interacted with the receptor on the surface of fibroblasts, to cause myocardial fibrosis. In addition, crosstalk between M1 macrophages and endothelial cells also plays a key role in fibrosis and immune response regulation through IL-1\u03b2 and corresponding receptors. CONCLUSIONS: M1 macrophages mediate diabetic myocardial fibrosis through interleukin-1\u03b2 interaction with fibroblasts."

                "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM)-ventricular dysfunction in the absence of underlying heart disease-is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of mortality associated with the disease. In DCM, cardiac fibrosis is the main cause of heart failure. Although it is well-established that the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway plays a part in inducing cardiac fibrosis in DCM, details of the molecular mechanism involved remain elusive. Therefore, it is crucial to study the gene reg;ulation of key signaling effectors in DCM-associated cardiac fibrosis. A recently emerged hotspot in the field of gene regulation is the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Recent evidence indicates that lncRNAs play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, in DCM, the function of these regulatory RNAs have not been studied in depth. In this study, we identified a conserved cardiac-specific lncRNA named colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (Crnde). By analyzing 376 human heart tissues, it was found that Crnde expression is negatively correlated with that of cardiac fibrosis marker genes. Moreover, Crnde expression was shown to be enriched in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Overexpression of Crnde attenuated cardiac fibrosis and enhanced cardiac function in mice with DCM. Further, in vitro experiments showed that Crnde negatively regulates the myofibroblast differentiation of CFs. The expression of Crnde was activated by SMAD family member 3 (Smad3), shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanism. Interestingly, Crnde also inhibited the transcriptional activation of Smad3 on target genes, thereby inhibiting the expression of myofibroblastic marker genes in CFs. Overall, our data provide valuable insights into the development of potential anti-cardiac fibrosis strategies centered on lncRNAs, for the treatment of DCM."

Understanding DCM is crucial, with fibroblasts and endothelial cells playing pivotal roles in driving myocardial fibrosis and contributing to cardiac dysfunction. Advances in Multimodal single-cell profiling, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, provide deeper insights into DCM's unique cell states and molecular landscape for targeted therapeutic interventions. METHODS: Single-cell RNA and ATAC data from 10x Multiome libraries were processed using Cell Ranger ARC v2.0.1. Gene expression and ATAC data underwent Seurat and Signac filtration. Differential gene expression and accessible chromatin regions were identified. Transcription factor activity was estimated with chromVAR, and Cis-coaccessibility networks were calculated using Cicero. Coaccessibility connections were compared to the GeneHancer database. Gene Ontology analysis, biological process scoring, cell-cell communication analysis, and gene-motif correlation was performed to reveal intricate molecular changes. Immunofluorescent staining utilized various antibodies on paraffin-embedded tissues to verify the findings. RESULTS: This study integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data obtained from hearts of WT and DCM mice, elucidating molecular changes at the single-cell level throughout the diabetic cardiomyopathy progression. Robust and accurate clustering analysis of the integrated data revealed altered cell proportions, showcasing decreased endothelial cells and macrophages, coupled with increased fibroblasts and myocardial cells in the DCM group, indicating enhanced fibrosis and endothelial damage. Chromatin accessibility analysis unveiled unique patterns in cell types, with heightened transcriptional activity in myocardial cells. Subpopulation analysis highlighted distinct changes in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, emphasizing pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and cardiac contraction. Fibroblast-centered communication analysis identified interactions with endothelial cells, implicating VEGF receptors. Endothelial cell subpopulations exhibited altered gene expressions, emphasizing contraction and growth-related pathways. Candidate regulators, including Tcf21, Arnt, Stat5a, and Stat5b, were identified, suggesting their pivotal roles in DCM development. Immunofluorescence staining validated marker genes of cell subpopulations, confirming PDK4, PPAR\u03b3 and Tpm1 as markers for metabolic pattern-altered cardiomyocytes, activated fibroblasts and endothelial cells with compromised proliferation. CONCLUSION: Our integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis unveils intricate cell states and molecular alterations in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Identified cell type-specific changes, transcription factors, and marker genes offer valuable insights. The study sheds light on potential therapeutic targets for DCM."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic myocardial fibrosis remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of cardiac fibroblasts in diabetic mice and its possible mechanism in the development of diabetic myocardial fibrosis. METHODS: We established a diabetic mouse model by injecting mice with streptozotocin. The overall cell profiles in diabetic hearts were analyzed using single-cell RNA transcriptomic techniques. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed by Masson's trichrome and Sirius red staining. Protein expression was analyzed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: A total of 11,585 cells were captured in control (Ctrl) and diabetic (DM) hearts. Twelve cell types were identified in this study. The number of fibroblasts was significantly higher in the DM hearts than in the Ctrl group. The fibroblasts were further re-clustered into nine subsets. Interestingly, cluster 4 fibroblasts were significantly increased in diabetic hearts compared with other fibroblast clusters. Lysyl oxidase (Lox) was highly expressed in DM fibroblasts (especially in cluster 4). Beta-aminopropionitrile, a Lox inhibitor, inhibited collagen expression and alleviated cardiac dysfunction in the diabetic group. Lysyl oxidase inhibition also reduced high glucose-induced collagen protein upregulation in primary fibroblasts. Moreover, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor not only prevented an increase in Lox and Col I but also inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the heterogeneity of cardiac fibroblasts in diabetic mice for the first time. Fibroblasts with high expression of Lox (cluster 4 fibroblasts) were identified to play a crucial role in fibrosis in diabetic heart disease. The findings of this study may provide a possible therapeutic target for interstitial fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus, with limited effective treatments. The cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2(SGLT2) inhibitors have been supported by amounts of clinical trials, which largely fills the gap. However, the underlying mechanism still needs to be further explored, especially in terms of its protection against cardiac fibrosis, a crucial pathophysiological process during the development of DCM. Besides, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has been reported to play a pivotal role in fibroblast multiplication and cardiac fibrosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) on DCM especially for cardiac fibrosis and explore the underlying mechanism. In vivo, the model of type 2 diabetic rats was built with high-fat feeding and streptozotocin injection. Untreated diabetic rats showed cardiac dysfunction, increased myocardial fibrosis and EndMT, which was attenuated after treatment with DAPA and metformin. In vitro, HUVECs and primary cardiac fibroblasts were treated with DAPA and exposed to high glucose (HG). HG-induced EndMT in HUVECs and collagen secretion of fibroblasts were markedly inhibited by DAPA. Up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling and activity inhibition of AMPK\u03b1 were also reversed by DAPA treatment. Then, AMPK\u03b1 siRNA and compound C abrogated the anti-EndMT effects of DAPA in HUVECs. From above all, our study implied that DAPA can protect against DCM and myocardial fibrosis through suppressing fibroblast activation and EndMT via AMPK\u03b1-mediated inhibition of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling."

                "abstract": "Rationale: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, a key pathological feature in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), is triggered by oxidative stress, inflammation, and various metabolic disorders in the heart. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the primary source of ECM proteins and the ultimate effector cells in ECM remodeling. CFs are turned on and differentiated into myofibroblasts in response to profibrotic signaling. Rnd3 is a small Rho-GTPase involved in the regulation of cell-cycle distribution, cell migration, and cell morphogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests a link between Rnd3 expression and onset of cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of Rnd3 in DCM remains unknown. Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to separate different types of cardiac cells. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was established in Rnd3 fibroblast-specific knockout and transgenic mice. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were used to discern signaling pathways involved. Results: Rnd3 expression was reduced in cardiac tissues of diabetic mice, with CFs being the primary cell type. Fibroblast-specific upregulation of Rnd3 in vivo was protective against DCM, whereas Rnd3 downregulation in fibroblasts accentuated cardiac oxidative stress, fibrosis, ventricular remodeling, and dysfunction. Moreover, in vitro Rnd3 overexpression significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species production, CF migration and proliferation under high levels of glucose (35 mmol/L) and palmitic acid (500 \u00b5mol/L) challenge. Furthermore, RNA sequencing indicated that Notch and TGF-\u03b2 signaling were significantly suppressed upon Rnd3 overexpression. Mechanistically, Rnd3 regulated Notch and TGF-\u03b2 signaling by interacting with NICD and ROCK1, respectively. Specifically, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity control Rnd3 expression by regulating the binding of Nr1H2 and Rnd3 promoter. Conclusions: Our findings provide compelling evidence in that fibroblast-specific activation of Rnd3 protects against cardiac remodeling in DCM, indicating promises of targeting Rnd3 in the treatment of DCM."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac fibrosis is a leading cause of cardiac dysfunction in patients with diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms of cardiac fibrosis remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of the long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) Airn in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in mice by streptozotocin injection. An intramyocardial adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to manipulate Airn expression. The functional significance and underlying mechanisms in DCM fibrosis were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Diabetic hearts showed a significant impairment in cardiac function, accompanied by obviously increased cardiac fibrosis. Interestingly, lncRNA Airn expression was significantly decreased in both diabetic hearts and high glucose (HG)-treated cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). AAV-mediated Airn reconstitution prevented cardiac fibrosis and the development of DCM, while Airn knockdown induced cardiac fibrosis phenotyping DCM. As in vitro, Airn reversed HG-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transition, aberrant CFs proliferation and section of collagen I. In contrast, Airn knockdown mimicked a HG-induced CFs phenotype. Mechanistically, we identified that Airn exerts anti-fibrotic effects by directly binding to insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IMP2) and further prevents its ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Moreover, we revealed that Airn/IMP2 protected p53 mRNA from degradation in m6A manner, leading to CF cell cycle arrest and reduced cardiac fibrosis. As a result, ablation of p53 blunted the inhibitory effects of Airn on fibroblast activation and cardiac fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated for the first time that Airn prevented the development of cardiac fibrosis in diabetic heart via IMP2-p53 axis in an m6A dependent manner. LncRNA Airn could be a promising therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis in DCM."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: MicroRNA-21 has been implicated in diabetic complication, including diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, there is limited information regarding the biological role of the miR-21 passenger strand (miR-21-3p) in diabetic cardiac fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-21-3p and its target androgen receptor in STZ-induced diabetic cardiac fibrosis. METHODS: The pathological changes and collagen depositions was analyzed by HE, Sirius Red staining and Masson's Trichrome Staining. MiR-21-3p, AR, NLRP3, caspase1 and collagen I expression were analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, miR one step qRT-PCR, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the interaction between miR-21 and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of AR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that miR-21-3p level was up-regulated, while AR was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic cardiac fibrosis tissues and cardiac fibroblast. High glucose triggers cardiac fibroblasts pyroptosis and collagen deposition. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-21-3p mediated the crucial role in diabetic cardiac fibrosis. Our results show that miR-21-3p bound to the 3'UTR of AR post-transcriptionally repressed its expression. We also found AR, which regulates cardiac fibroblasts pyroptosis and collagen deposition through caspase1 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: /interpretation: Taken together, our study showed that miR-21-3p aggravates STZ-induced diabetic cardiac fibrosis through the caspase1 pathways by suppressing AR expression."

                "abstract": "Rationale: Among all the diabetic complications, diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by myocyte loss and myocardial fibrosis, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. Tissue kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are secreted serine proteases, that have distinct and overlapping roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. However, whether KLKs are involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy remains unknown.The present study aimed to determine the role of a specific KLK in the initiation of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) during the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results-By screening gene expression profiles of KLKs, it was found that KLK8 was highly induced in the myocardium of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. KLK8 deficiency attenuated diabetic cardiac fibrosis, and rescued the impaired cardiac function in diabetic mice. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated KLK8 knockdown significantly attenuated high glucose-induced endothelial damage and EndMT in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Diabetes-induced endothelial injury and cardiac EndMT were significantly alleviated in KLK8-deficient mice. In addition, transgenic overexpression of KLK8 led to interstitial and perivascular cardiac fibrosis, endothelial injury and EndMT in the heart. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KLK8 (Ad-KLK8) resulted in increases in endothelial cell damage, permeability and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 release in HCAECs. KLK8 overexpression also induced EndMT in HCAECs, which was alleviated by a TGF-\u03b21-neutralizing antibody. A specificity protein-1 (Sp-1) consensus site was identified in the human KLK8 promoter and was found to mediate the high glucose-induced KLK8 expression. Mechanistically, it was identified that the vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/plakoglobin complex may associate with KLK8 in HCAECs. KLK8 cleaved the VE-cadherin extracellular domain, thus promoting plakoglobin nuclear translocation. Plakoglobin was required for KLK8-induced EndMT by cooperating with p53. KLK8 overexpression led to plakoglobin-dependent association of p53 with hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, which further enhanced the transactivation effect of HIF-1\u03b1 on the TGF-\u03b21 promoter. KLK8 also induced the binding of p53 with Smad3, subsequently promoting pro-EndMT reprogramming via the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway in HCAECs. The in vitro and in vivo findings further demonstrated that high glucose may promote plakoglobin-dependent cooperation of p53 with HIF-1\u03b1 and Smad3, subsequently increasing the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and the pro-EndMT target genes of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway in a KLK8-dependent manner. Conclusions: The present findings uncovered a novel pro-EndMT mechanism during the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiac fibrosis via the upregulation of KLK8, and may contribute to the development of future KLK8-based therapeutic strategies for diabetic cardiomyopathy."

                "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with cardiomyopathy. The underlying mechanisms for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy are complex and not completely understood. Recent studies showed that epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are involved in diabetes-induced cardiac injury. However, the role of EGFR in the diabetic heart has yet to be confirmed. The aim of the present study is to further determine the role of EGRF in the pathogenesis of diabetic heart injury. The type 1 diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin were treated with EGFR inhibitors (AG1478 and 451) for 8 weeks, respectively. It was observed that diabetes induced phospohorylation of EGFR and AKT, increased cardiac ROS levels, and ultimately led to cardiac remodeling including cardiac hypertrophy, disorganization, apoptosis, and fibrosis, while all these molecular and pathological alterations were attenuated by the treatment with EGFR inhibitors. In vitro, either pharmacological inhibition of EGFR/AKT or sh-RNA silencing of EGFR significantly inhibited high concentration glucose (HG)-induced ROS generation and subsequently cell apoptosis in both cardiac H9C2 cells and primary rat cardiomyocytes, respectively. The ROS reduction by EGFR inhibitor was associated with the decreased NADPH oxidase activity and expression in H9c2 cells. HG-induced cardiomyocyte injuries were also reduced by NAC, an inhibitor of ROS. This study provides evidence that EGFR has a key role in the pathogenesis of STZ-induced diabetic cardiac damage and remodeling via ROS generation, and suggests that EGFR may be a potential target in treating diabetic cardiomyopathy."

                "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins like human antigen R (HuR) are key regulators in post-transcriptional control of gene expression in several pathophysiological conditions. Diabetes adversely affects monocyte/macrophage biology and function. It is not known whether diabetic milieu affects cellular/exosome-HuR and its implications on cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Here, we evaluate in vitro and in vivo effects of diabetic milieu on macrophage cellular/exosome-HuR, alterations in intercellular cross talk with fibroblasts, and its impact on cardiac remodeling. Human failing hearts show higher HuR levels. Diabetic milieu activates HuR expression in cardiac- and cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM\u00d8) and stimulates HuR nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and exosome transfer. Exosomes from macrophages exposed to diabetic milieu (high glucose or db/db mice) significantly increase inflammatory and profibrogenic responses in fibroblast (in vitro) and cardiac fibrosis in mice. Intriguingly, Exo-HuR deficiency (HuR knockdown in macrophage) abrogates the above effects. In diabetic mice, macrophage depletion followed by reconstitution with BMM\u00d8-derived HuR-deficient exosomes inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis response and preserves left ventricle function as compared to control-exosome administration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that diabetes activates BMM\u00d8 HuR expression and its transfer into exosome. The data suggest that HuR might be targeted to alleviate macrophage dysfunction and pathological fibrosis in diabetes."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and its specific pathophysiology remains unclear. Recent studies have changed our understanding of cardiac cellularity, with cellular changes accompanying diabetes yet to be examined in detail. This study aims to characterise the changes in the cardiac cellular landscape in murine diabetes to identify potential cellular protagonists in the diabetic heart. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male FVB/N mice by low-dose streptozotocin and a high-fat diet for 26-weeks. Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography at endpoint. Flow cytometry was performed on cardiac ventricles as well as blood, spleen, and bone-marrow at endpoint from non-diabetic and diabetic mice. To validate flow cytometry results, immunofluorescence staining was conducted on left-ventricles of age-matched mice. RESULTS: Mice with diabetes exhibited hyperglycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance at endpoint. Echocardiography revealed reduced E:A and e':a' ratios in diabetic mice indicating diastolic dysfunction. Systolic function was not different between the experimental groups. Detailed examination of cardiac cellularity found resident mesenchymal cells (RMCs) were elevated as a result of diabetes, due to a marked increase in cardiac fibroblasts, while smooth muscle cells were reduced in proportion. Moreover, we found increased levels of Ly6Chi monocytes in both the heart and in the blood. Consistent with this, the proportion of bone-marrow haematopoietic stem cells were increased in diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Murine diabetes results in distinct changes in cardiac cellularity. These changes-in particular increased levels of fibroblasts-offer a framework for understanding how cardiac cellularity changes in diabetes. The results also point to new cellular mechanisms in this context, which may further aid in development of pharmacotherapies to allay the progression of cardiomyopathy associated with diabetes."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac macrophages (cMPs) are increasingly recognized as important regulators of myocardial homeostasis and disease, yet the role of noncoding RNA in these cells is largely unknown. Small RNA sequencing of the entire miRNomes of the major cardiac cell fractions revealed microRNA-21 (miR-21) as the single highest expressed microRNA in cMPs, both in health and disease (25% and 43% of all microRNA reads, respectively). MiR-21 has been previously reported as a key microRNA driving tissue fibrosis. Here, we aimed to determine the function of macrophage miR-21 on myocardial homeostasis and disease-associated remodeling. METHODS: Macrophage-specific ablation of miR-21 in mice driven by Cx3cr1-Cre was used to determine the function of miR-21 in this cell type. As a disease model, mice were subjected to pressure overload for 6 and 28 days. Cardiac function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography, followed by histological analyses and single-cell sequencing. Cocultures of macrophages and cardiac fibroblasts were used to study macrophage-to-fibroblast signaling. RESULTS: Mice with macrophage-specific genetic deletion of miR-21 were protected from interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction when subjected to pressure overload of the left ventricle. Single-cell sequencing of pressure-overloaded hearts from these mice revealed that miR-21 in macrophages is essential for their polarization toward a M1-like phenotype. Systematic quantification of intercellular communication mediated by ligand-receptor interactions across all cell types revealed that miR-21 primarily determined macrophage-fibroblast communication, promoting the transition from quiescent fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Polarization of isolated macrophages in vitro toward a proinflammatory (M1-like) phenotype activated myofibroblast transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts in a paracrine manner and was dependent on miR-21 in cMPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a critical role of cMPs in pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction and reveal macrophage miR-21 as a key molecule for the profibrotic role of cMPs."

                "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication of diabetes, and features myocardial fibrosis as its main pathological feature. Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor, which involves in myocardial fibrosis by regulation of calcium homeostasis. Calhex231, the CaSR inhibitor, is not clear whether it regulates myocardial fibrosis in DCM. In the present study, type 1 diabetic (T1D) rats and primary neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were used to observe the role of Calhex231. In vivo experiments showed that in the T1D group, contractile dysfunction and the deposition of collagen I and III were obvious after 12 weeks. In vitro experiments, we found that high glucose (HG) could increase the expression of CaSR, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) collagen I/III, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP9, along with cardiac fibroblast migration and proliferation. We further demonstrated that CaSR activation increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and upregulated the expression of Itch (atrophin-1 interacting protein 4), which resulted in increasing the ubiquitination levels of Smad7 and upregulating the expression of p-Smad2, p-Smad3. However, treatment with Calhex231 clearly inhibited the above-mentioned changes. Collectively these results suggest that Calhex231 could inhibit Itch-ubiquitin proteasome and TGF-\u03b21/Smads pathways, and then depress the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, along with the reduction deposition of collagen, alleviate glucose-induced myocardial fibrosis. Our findings indicate an important new mechanism for myocardial fibrosis, and suggest Calhex231 would be a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of DCM."

Its expression is increased in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), but its role is unclear. We investigated the potential role and mechanism of HMGB1 in diabetes-induced myocardial fibrosis and dysfunction in mice. METHODS: In vivo, type 1 diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) in mice. HMGB1 expression was knocked down by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Total collagen deposition was assessed by Masson's trichrome and Picrosirius red staining. HMGB1, collagen I and III, and transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) expression was quantified by immunostaining and western bolt analysis. In vitro, isolated neonatal cardiac fibroblasts were treated with high glucose (HG) or recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1). Pharmacologic (neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody) or genetic (shRNA-HMGB1) inhibition of HMGB1 was used to investigate the role of HMGB1 in HG-induced functional changes of cardiac fibroblasts. RESULTS: In vivo, HMGB1 was diffusely expressed in the myocardium of diabetic mice. HMGB1 silencing ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling and decreased collagen deposition in diabetic mice. In vitro, HG induced HMGB1 translocation and secretion in both viable cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Administration of rHMGB1 dose-dependently increased the expression of collagens I and III and TGF-\u03b21 in cardiac fibroblasts. HMGB1 inhibition reduced HG-induced collagen production, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities, proliferation, and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in cardiac fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 inhibition could alleviate cardiac fibrosis and remodeling in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Inhibition of HMGB1 might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of the disease."

High glucose-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, activation of various pro-inflammatory, and cell death pathways are critical in the initiation and progression of the changes culminating in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) activation in inflammatory cells and activated endothelium attenuates the pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hepatic cardiomyopathy. In this study, we explored the role of CB2R signaling in myocardial dysfunction, oxidative/nitrative stress, inflammation, cell death, remodeling, and fibrosis associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetic mice. Control human heart left ventricles and atrial appendages, similarly to mouse hearts, had negligible CB2R expression determine by RNA sequencing or real-time RT-PCR. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was characterized by impaired diastolic and systolic cardiac function, enhanced myocardial CB2R expression, oxidative/nitrative stress, and pro-inflammatory response (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, and cell death. Pharmacological activation of CB2R with a selective agonist attenuated diabetes-induced inflammation, oxidative/nitrative stress, fibrosis and cell demise, and consequent cardiac dysfunction without affecting hyperglycemia. In contrast, genetic deletion of CB2R aggravated myocardial pathology. Thus, selective activation of CB2R ameliorates diabetes-induced myocardial tissue injury and preserves the functional contractile capacity of the myocardium in the diabetic milieu. This is particularly encouraging, since unlike CB1R agonists, CB2R agonists do not elicit psychoactive activity and cardiovascular side effects and are potential clinical candidates in the treatment of diabetic cardiovascular and other complications."

This study was undertaken to investigate whether targeted disruption of calpain would reduce myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in mouse models of type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes in mice was induced by injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and OVE26 mice were also used as a type 1 diabetic model. The function of calpain was genetically manipulated by cardiomyocyte-specific knockout Capn4 in mice and the use of calpastatin transgenic mice. Myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis were investigated 2 and 5 months after STZ injection or in OVE26 diabetic mice at the age of 5 months. Cultured isolated adult mouse cardiac fibroblast cells were also investigated under high glucose conditions. RESULTS: Calpain activity, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas, and myocardial collagen deposition were significantly increased in both STZ-induced and OVE26 diabetic hearts, and these were accompanied by elevated expression of hypertrophic and fibrotic collagen genes. Deficiency of Capn4 or overexpression of calpastatin reduced myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in both diabetic models, leading to the improvement of myocardial function. These effects were associated with a normalization of the nuclear factor of activated T-cell nuclear factor-\u03baB and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities in diabetic hearts. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, high glucose-induced proliferation and MMP activities were prevented by calpain inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in diabetic mice are attenuated by reduction of calpain function. Thus targeted inhibition of calpain represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for reversing diabetic cardiomyopathy."

The acute response involves changes in blood and tissue biomarkers and in cardiac in vivo imaging acquired with ultrasound, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography. Longitudinal follow up using in vivo imaging, histochemistry, protein and proteomics analyses evidences a continued metabolic reprogramming of the heart towards metabolic malfunction, eventually leading to irreversible damage in cardiac function and structure.

                "abstract": "AIM: Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is an acute cardiac syndrome with substantial morbidity and mortality. The unique hallmark of SIC is extensive ventricular dysfunction (akinesia) involving apical segments with preserved function in basal segments. Adrenergic overstimulation plays an important role in initiating SIC, but the pathomechanisms involved are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that excessive catecholamines cause perturbation of myocardial lipid metabolism and that cardiac lipotoxicity is responsible for the pathogenesis of SIC. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single dose injection of isoprenaline (ISO; 400 mg/kg) induced SIC-like regional akinesia in mice. Oil red O staining revealed severe lipid accumulation in the heart 2 h post-ISO. Both intramyocardial lipid accumulation and cardiac function were normalized within 1 week post-ISO and no significant amount of fibrosis was detected. We found that gene expression of lipid importers and exporters (ApoB lipoprotein) was depressed 2 h post-ISO. These results were confirmed by similar findings in SIC patients and in ISO/patient serum-stressed HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Moreover, overexpression of ApoB in the heart was found to protect against the development of ISO-induced cardiac toxicity and cardiac dysfunction. We also found that ISO-induced intramyocardial lipid accumulation caused electrophysiological disturbance and stunning in ISO/patient serum-stressed HL-1 cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that lipotoxicity is closely associated with catecholamine-induced myocardial dysfunction, including neurogenic stunning, metabolic stunning, and electrophysiological stunning. Cardiac lipotoxicity may originate from direct inhibition of myocardial ApoB lipoprotein and subsequent decreased lipid export, caused by supraphysiological levels of catecholamines."

                "abstract": "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is identified as an acute severe ventricular systolic dysfunction, which is usually characterized by reversible and transient akinesia of walls of the ventricle in the absence of a significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients present with chest pain, ST-segment elevation or ischemia signs on ECG and increased troponin, similar to myocardial infarction. Currently, the known mechanisms associated with the development of TTS include elevated levels of circulating plasma catecholamines and their metabolites, coronary microvascular dysfunction, sympathetic hyperexcitability, inflammation, estrogen deficiency, spasm of the epicardial coronary vessels, genetic predisposition and thyroidal dysfunction. However, the real etiologic link remains unclear and seems to be multifactorial. Currently, the elusive pathogenesis of TTS and the lack of optimal treatment leads to the necessity of the application of experimental models or platforms for studying TTS. Excessive catecholamines can cause weakened ventricular wall motion at the apex and increased basal motion due to the apicobasal adrenoceptor gradient. The use of beta-blockers does not seem to impact the outcome of TTS patients, suggesting that signaling other than the beta-adrenoceptor-associated pathway is also involved and that the pathogenesis may be more complex than it was expected. Herein, we review the pathophysiological mechanisms related to TTS; preclinical TTS models and platforms such as animal models, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) models and their usefulness for TTS studies, including exploring and improving the understanding of the pathomechanism of the disease. This might be helpful to provide novel insights on the exact pathophysiological mechanisms and may offer more information for experimental and clinical research on TTS."

However, relating observed differences in single cells to the capacity of such alterations to result in the extreme changes in ventricular shape seen in Takotsubo syndrome is difficult. By using a computational model of the rat left ventricle, we investigate which mechanisms can give rise to the typical shape of the ventricle observed in this syndrome. Three potential dominant mechanisms related to effects of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation were considered: apical-basal variation of calcium transients due to differences in L-type and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activation, apical-basal variation of calcium sensitivity due to differences in troponin I phosphorylation, and apical-basal variation in maximal active tension due to, e.g., the negative inotropic effects of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, we investigated the interaction of these spatial variations in the presence of a failing Frank-Starling mechanism. We conclude that a large portion of the apex needs to be affected by severe changes in calcium regulation or contractile function to result in apical ballooning, and smooth linear variation from apex to base is unlikely to result in the typical ventricular shape observed in this syndrome. A failing Frank-Starling mechanism significantly increases apical ballooning at end systole and may be an important additional factor underpinning Takotsubo syndrome. "

                "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, is a very interesting syndrome of acute transient left ventricular dysfunction, usually following significant emotional stress. It was first described in Japan nearly two decades ago and many aspects of its pathogenesis still remain poorly understood. The incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death related to Takotsubo is currently unknown. Excess catecholamines following stress seem to trigger Takotsubo and play an important role. The clinical presentation resembles acute myocardial infarction, including chest tightness and/or dyspnea, ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes. However, in contrast to a typical acute myocardial infarction, no significant coronary lesions or thrombi are found on coronary angiography. Differentiating Takotsubo from acute myocardial infarction is important to avoid the unnecessary risks of thrombolytic therapy. Typically, left ventriculography shows marked abnormalities with akinesia in the mid-distal anterior wall and apex (occasionally involving other heart regions), giving a balloon shape to the left ventricle. The name Takotsubo originates from the shape of the left ventricle, which resembles a Japanese octopus-trapping pot. Hospital mortality is low but death can be caused by severe acute heart failure and/or ventricular arrhythmias. Typically, a stressful life event is reported preceding the acute symptoms. Takotsubo is most common in menopausal women although young individuals, including men, can also be affected. The autonomic nervous system has a defined role in the process. In this article, we will review the role of imaging the heart using (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine, a radioactive marker allowing mapping of the autonomic nervous system of the heart, in cases of suspected Takotsubo."

                "abstract": "Takotsubo syndrome is a relatively frequent clinical entity presenting typically as an acute coronary syndrome in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and characterized angiographically by transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction, sparing the basal segments of the left ventricle (\"apical ballooning\"). Takotsubo syndrome characteristically affects peri- or postmenopausal women, albeit recent series show that men also are at risk. Takotsubo syndrome is characteristically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, which suggests a pathogenic role for increased sympathetic activity leading to myocardial perfusion abnormalities and ventricular dysfunction. The reasons why severe emotional and physical stress result in the development of takotsubo syndrome in certain individuals but not others is still a matter of speculation, but strongly suggests the existence of predisposing factors/mechanisms in certain subjects. The present article reviews the different factors that can play a role in the development of takotsubo syndrome in different patients. We propose that triggers (ie, emotional stressors, physical stressors, iatrogenic stressors, and neurologic triggers), pathogenic mechanisms (ie, increased catecholamine levels, coronary vasomotor abnormalities leading to myocardial ischemia), and predisposing factors (ie, cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial dysfunction, comorbidities) all interact in a complex fashion and possibly differently in different patients to cause takotsubo syndrome. Identifying these factors may help in preventing and managing the condition more effectively. "

To date, our understanding of the molecular basis for TTS remains unknown and, consequently, specific therapies are lacking. Myocardial infiltration of monocytes and macrophages in TTS has been documented in clinical studies. However, the functional importance of these findings remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a single high dose of isoproterenol (ISO) in mice induced a TTS-like cardiomyopathy phenotype characterized by female predominance, severe cardiac dysfunction, and robust myocardial infiltration of macrophages. Single-cell RNA-Seq studies of myocardial immune cells revealed that TTS-like cardiomyopathy is associated with complex activation of innate and adaptive immune cells in the heart, and macrophages were identified as the dominant immune cells. Global macrophage depletion (via clodronate liposome administration) or blockade of macrophage infiltration (via a CCR2 antagonist or in CCR2-KO mice) resulted in recovery of cardiac dysfunction in ISO-challenged mice. In addition, damping myeloid cell activation by HIF1\u03b1 deficiency or exposure to the immunomodulatory agent bortezomib ameliorated ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction. Collectively, our findings identify macrophages as a critical regulator of TTS pathogenesis that can be targeted for therapeutic gain."

The underlying disease mechanism in TTS is still unknown. A genetic basis has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to establish an in\u00a0vitro induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of TTS, to test the hypothesis of altered \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in TTS iPSC-cardiomyocytes (CMs), and to explore whether genetic susceptibility underlies the pathophysiology of TTS. METHODS: Somatic cells of patients with TTS and control subjects were reprogrammed to iPSCs and differentiated into\u00a0CMs. Three-month-old CMs were subjected to catecholamine stimulation to simulate neurohumoral overstimulation. We investigated \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and TTS cardiomyocyte function. RESULTS: Enhanced \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in TTS-iPSC-CMs under catecholamine-induced stress increased expression of the cardiac stress marker NR4A1; cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels; and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A-mediated hyperphosphorylation of RYR2-S2808, PLN-S16, TNI-S23/24, and Cav1.2-S1928, and leads to a reduced calcium time to transient 50% decay. These cellular catecholamine-dependent responses were mainly mediated by \u03b21-adrenoceptor signaling in TTS. Engineered heart muscles from TTS-iPSC-CMs showed an impaired\u00a0force of contraction and a higher sensitivity to isoprenaline-stimulated inotropy compared with control subjects.\u00a0In addition, altered electrical activity and increased lipid accumulation were detected in catecholamine-treated TTS-iPSC-CMs, and were confirmed by differentially expressed lipid transporters CD36 and CPT1C.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy. CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety presented with symptoms that mimicked acute coronary syndrome (ACS); the chief symptom was chest tightness. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, with minimal ST elevation in the anterior leads. The patient was initially treated for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and symptoms resolved. Coronary angiography ruled out ACS and confirmed a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. DISCUSSION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is commonly triggered by severe emotional or psychological stress and occurs primarily in postmenopausal women. A reversible contractility abnormality of the left ventricle causes the ventricle to take on a balloon-like appearance; hence the name of takotsubo, a Japanese octopus fishing pot that has a narrow neck and a wide midsection. Signs and symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimic those of ACS. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is best diagnosed with coronary angiography, which can rule out blockage. Treatment usually consists of carvedilol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocking agent if left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40%. The syndrome is usually spontaneously reversible and cardiovascular function returns to normal after a few weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy causes a reversible left ventricle dysfunction which occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women with or without cardiovascular disease. Recognition is detected with coronary angiography. It is thought to primarily be due to an abnormally high sympathetic stimulation after emotional or psychological stress. Treatment consists of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or beta blocker if needed for left ventricular dysfunction and possibly an anxiolytic agent."

The study of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) by use of positron emission tomography might help in understanding this syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three postmenopausal women underwent adenosine/rest perfusion with nitrogen 13 ammonia and metabolism with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and echocardiography in the acute phase of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and at 3 months' follow-up, after normalization of left ventricular function. PET study was performed in 2 parts: the perfusion analysis with nitrogen ammonia and the metabolism of the heart using FDG. MBF and CFR were analyzed quantitatively in the acute phase and at follow-up. The images highlighted the impairment of tissue metabolism in the dysfunctioning left ventricular segments in the acute phase, mainly in the apical segments and progressively less in the medium segments. At the same time, a clear inverse metabolic/perfusion mismatch emerged, which normalized 3 months later. The quantitative analysis of MBF showed a reduction in the acute phase in apical segments in comparison to basal segments without differences between midventricular and basal segments. In the acute phase CFR proved to be reduced in apical versus basal segments. CFR impairment of apical segments recovered completely after 3 months. CONCLUSION: The acute phase of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by an inverse perfusion/metabolism mismatch with a reduction in CFR in the apical segments. However, the impairment of CFR and the reduction of metabolism in the apical segments recovered completely after 3 months."

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was first described in 1990 in Japan after octopus trapping pot with a round bottom and narrow neck similar in shape to left ventriculogram in TTC patients. The occurrence of TTC is usually precipitated by a stressful event with a clinical presentation mimicking myocardial infarction: chest pain, ST-T segment elevation or T-wave inversion, a rise in cardiac troponin, and contractility abnormalities in echocardiography. A left ventricular dysfunction is transient and improves within a few weeks. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically occurs in postmenopausal women and the postulated mechanism is catecholamine overstimulation. Moreover, the distribution of contractility impairments usually does not correspond with typical region supplied by a single coronary artery. Therefore, the assessment of regional pattern of systolic dysfunction with speckle-tracking echocardiography and automated function imaging (AFI) technique may be important in diagnosis of TTC and may improve our insight into its patophysiology. We described a 55-year-old female teacher with TTC diagnosed after acute psychological stress in workplace. The provoking factor related with occupational stress and pattern of contraction abnormalities documented with AFI technique including basal segments of left ventricle make this case atypical. "

                "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or stress-induced cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized syndrome characterized by severe regional left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of an explanatory coronary lesion. TCM may lead to lethal complications but is completely reversible if the patient survives the acute phase. The pathogenesis of TCM and the mechanism behind this remarkable recovery are unknown. Plasma levels of catecholamine are elevated in many TCM patients and exogenously administered catecholamine induces TCM-like cardiac dysfunction in both humans and rats. A catecholamine excess increases myocardial metabolic demand by increasing the force of contraction as well as the heart rate, and also alters cardiac depolarization patterns. We propose that an altered spatiotemporal pattern of cardiac contraction and excessive force of contraction may lead to a redistribution of wall stresses in the left ventricle. This redistribution of wall stress causes regional mechanical overload of regions where wall tension becomes disproportionately great and renders these cardiomyocytes \"metabolically insufficient\". In other words, these cardiomyocytes experience a demand: supply mismatch on the basis of excessive metabolic demand. In order to prevent the death of these cardiomyocytes and to prevent excessive wall tension from developing in neighboring regions, a protective metabolic shutdown occurs in the affected cardiomyocytes. This metabolic shutdown, i.e., acute down regulation of non-vital cellular functions, serves to protect the affected regions from necrosis and explains the apparently complete recovery observed in TCM. We propose that this phenomenon may share important characteristics with phenomena such as ischemic conditioning, stunning and hibernation. In this manuscript, we discuss our hypothesis in the context of available knowledge and discuss important experiments that would help to corroborate or refute the hypothesis. "

                "abstract": "In July 2009, the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) began work on Non-Invasive Cardiac Imaging Technologies for the Assessment of Myocardial Viability, an evidence-based review of the literature surrounding different cardiac imaging modalities to ensure that appropriate technologies are accessed by patients undergoing viability assessment. This project came about when the Health Services Branch at the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care asked MAS to provide an evidentiary platform on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities.After an initial review of the strategy and consultation with experts, MAS identified five key non-invasive cardiac imaging technologies that can be used for the assessment of myocardial viability: positron emission tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, dobutamine echocardiography, and dobutamine echocardiography with contrast, and single photon emission computed tomography.A 2005 review conducted by MAS determined that positron emission tomography was more sensitivity than dobutamine echocardiography and single photon emission tomography and dominated the other imaging modalities from a cost-effective standpoint. However, there was inadequate evidence to compare positron emission tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Thus, this report focuses on this comparison only. For both technologies, an economic analysis was also completed.A summary decision analytic model was then developed to encapsulate the data from each of these reports (available on the OHTAC and MAS website).The Non-Invasive Cardiac Imaging Technologies for the Assessment of Myocardial Viability is made up of the following reports, which can be publicly accessed at the MAS website at: www.health.gov.on.ca/mas or at www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.htmlPOSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY: An Evidence-Based AnalysisMAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY: An Evidence-Based Analysis OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) for the assessment of myocardial viability. To evaluate the effectiveness of cardiac MRI viability imaging, the following outcomes were examined: the diagnostic accuracy in predicting functional recovery and the impact of cardiac MRI viability imaging on prognosis (mortality and other patient outcomes). CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION  LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION AND HEART FAILURE: Heart failure is a complex syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to maintain adequate blood circulation through the body leading to multiorgan abnormalities and, eventually, death. Patients with heart failure experience poor functional capacity, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In 2005, more than 71,000 Canadians died from cardiovascular disease, of which, 54% were due to ischemic heart disease. Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease (CAD) () is the primary cause of heart failure accounting for more than 70% of cases. The prevalence of heart failure was estimated at one percent of the Canadian population in 1989. Since then, the increase in the older population has undoubtedly resulted in a substantial increase in cases. Heart failure is associated with a poor prognosis: one-year mortality rates were 32.9% and 31.1% for men and women, respectively in Ontario between 1996 and 1997. TREATMENT OPTIONS: IN GENERAL, THERE ARE THREE OPTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEART FAILURE: medical treatment, heart transplantation, and revascularization for those with CAD as the underlying cause. Concerning medical treatment, despite recent advances, mortality remains high among treated patients, while, heart transplantation is affected by the limited availability of donor hearts and consequently has long waiting lists. The third option, revascularization, is used to restore the flow of blood to the heart via coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or, in some cases, through minimally invasive percutaneous coronary interventions (balloon angioplasty and stenting). Both methods, however, are associated with important perioperative risks including mortality, so it is essential to properly select patients for this procedure. MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY: Left ventricular dysfunction may be permanent, due to the formation of myocardial scar, or it may be reversible after revascularization. Reversible LV dysfunction occurs when the myocardium is viable but dysfunctional (reduced contractility). Since only patients with dysfunctional but viable myocardium benefit from revascularization, the identification and quantification of the extent of myocardial viability is an important part of the work-up of patients with heart failure when determining the most appropriate treatment path. Various non-invasive cardiac imaging modalities can be used to assess patients in whom determination of viability is an important clinical issue, specifically: dobutamine echocardiography (echo),stress echo with contrast,SPECT using either technetium or thallium,cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI), andpositron emission tomography (PET). DOBUTAMINE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: Stress echocardiography can be used to detect viable myocardium. During the infusion of low dose dobutamine (5 - 10 \u00b5g/kg/min), an improvement of contractility in hypokinetic and akentic segments is indicative of the presence of viable myocardium. Alternatively, a low-high dose dobutamine protocol can be used in which a biphasic response characterized by improved contractile function during the low-dose infusion followed by a deterioration in contractility due to stress induced ischemia during the high dose dobutamine infusion (dobutamine dose up to 40 ug/kg/min) represents viable tissue. Newer techniques including echocardiography using contrast agents, harmonic imaging, and power doppler imaging may help to improve the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiographic assessment of myocardial viability. STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY WITH CONTRAST: Intravenous contrast agents, which are high molecular weight inert gas microbubbles that act like red blood cells in the vascular space, can be used during echocardiography to assess myocardial viability. These agents allow for the assessment of myocardial blood flow (perfusion) and contractile function (as described above), as well as the simultaneous assessment of perfusion to make it possible to distinguish between stunned and hibernating myocardium.  SPECT: SPECT can be performed using thallium-201 (Tl-201), a potassium analogue, or technetium-99 m labelled tracers. When Tl-201 is injected intravenously into a patient, it is taken up by the myocardial cells through regional perfusion, and Tl-201 is retained in the cell due to sodium/potassium ATPase pumps in the myocyte membrane. The stress-redistribution-reinjection protocol involves three sets of images. The first two image sets (taken immediately after stress and then three to four hours after stress) identify perfusion defects that may represent scar tissue or viable tissue that is severely hypoperfused. The third set of images is taken a few minutes after the re-injection of Tl-201 and after the second set of images is completed. These re-injection images identify viable tissue if the defects exhibit significant fill-in (> 10% increase in tracer uptake) on the re-injection images. The other common Tl-201 viability imaging protocol, rest-redistribution, involves SPECT imaging performed at rest five minutes after Tl-201 is injected and again three to four hours later. Viable tissue is identified if the delayed images exhibit significant fill-in of defects identified in the initial scans (> 10% increase in uptake) or if defects are fixed but the tracer activity is greater than 50%. There are two technetium-99 m tracers: sestamibi (MIBI) and tetrofosmin. The uptake and retention of these tracers is dependent on regional perfusion and the integrity of cellular membranes. Viability is assessed using one set of images at rest and is defined by segments with tracer activity greater than 50%. CARDIAC POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine technique used to image tissues based on the distinct ways in which normal and abnormal tissues metabolize positron-emitting radionuclides. Radionuclides are radioactive analogs of common physiological substrates such as sugars, amino acids, and free fatty acids that are used by the body. The only licensed radionuclide used in PET imaging for viability assessment is F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). During a PET scan, the radionuclides are injected into the body and as they decay, they emit positively charged particles (positrons) that travel several millimetres into tissue and collide with orbiting electrons. This collision results in annihilation where the combined mass of the positron and electron is converted into energy in the form of two 511 keV gamma rays, which are then emitted in opposite directions (180 degrees) and captured by an external array of detector elements in the PET gantry. Computer software is then used to convert the radiation emission into images. The system is set up so that it only detects coincident gamma rays that arrive at the detectors within a predefined temporal window, while single photons arriving without a pair or outside the temporal window do not active the detector. This allows for increased spatial and contrast resolution. CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) is a non-invasive, x-ray free technique that uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed images of the structure and function of the heart.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by myocardial hypocontractility from the mid left ventricle to the apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein-activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein-activated cardiodepressant pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via G(i) inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. \u03b2(2)AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a \u03b2(2)AR-Gi-dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-G(i) effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas \u03b2-blockers that activate \u03b2(2)AR-G(i) exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for \u03b2(2)AR-G(s) at low concentrations and for G(i) at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in \u03b2(2)ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific \u03b2(2)AR-G(i) signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress."

This stress- induced cardiomyopathy mimics myocardial infarction, but without significant coronary artery disease, and rarely presents in perioperative period. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of postmenopausal woman scheduled to undergo elective cholecystectomy, with no history of coronary artery disease. She presented perioperatively with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy by unique manifestation-asystoly. This uncommon cause of cardiac arrest during anaesthesia was possibly induced by preoperative emotional stress. There was full recovery thanks to intensive management. In Takotsubo cardiomyopathy related cardiogenic shock we used the calcium sensitiser levosimendan successfully. CONCLUSION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has an excellent long-term prognosis and nearly all patients have full recovery of left ventricular function. We emphasize the importance of heavy premedication by stress compromised patients and the need of sufficiently deep anaesthesia and analgesia during surgeries."

                "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an important differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. It is characterized by normal (or near-normal) coronary arteries, regional wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond a single coronary vascular bed, and often, a precipitating stressor. Variants of the classical left ventricular apical ballooning, including mid- or basal left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, are increasingly recognized. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not rare, and heightened awareness of this unique cardiomyopathy likely will lead to a higher reported incidence. Diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy has important implications for clinical management at presentation and afterward. The long-term prognosis is generally favorable; however, a small subset has potentially life-threatening complications during the initial presentation. The pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown, but catecholamine excess likely has a central role."

            "abstract": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a much higher incidence of cardiac dysfunction, which contributes to the high mortality rate of RA despite anti-arthritic drug therapy. In this study, we investigated dynamic changes in cardiac function in classic animal models of RA and examined the potential effectors of RA-induced heart failure (HF). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models were established in rats and mice. The cardiac function of CIA animals was dynamically monitored using echocardiography and haemodynamics. We showed that cardiac diastolic and systolic dysfunction occurred in CIA animals and persisted after joint inflammation and that serum proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) levels were decreased. We did not find evidence of atherosclerosis (AS) in arthritic animals even though cardiomyopathy was significant. We observed that an impaired cardiac \u03b21AR-excitation contraction coupling signal was accompanied by sustained increases in blood epinephrine levels in CIA rats. Furthermore, serum epinephrine concentrations were positively correlated with the heart failure biomarker NT-proBNP in RA patients (r2\u2009=\u2009+0.53, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). In CIA mice, treatment with the nonselective \u03b2AR blocker carvedilol (2.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1, for 4 weeks) or the specific GRK2 inhibitor paroxetine (2.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1, for 4 weeks) effectively rescued heart function. We conclude that chronic and persistent \u03b2-adrenergic stress in CIA animals is a significant contributor to cardiomyopathy, which may be a potential target for protecting RA patients against HF."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Liquiritigenin (LG) is a triterpene with anti-inflammatory properties. Our study aimed to explore the effect of LG on RA and the cardiac complication. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice with LG treatment exhibited obvious alleviation in histopathological changes, accompanied by the decreased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-17A in synovium and serum. LG attenuated cartilage destruction by reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13 expression in the synovium of CIA mice. The echocardiography results proved the alleviation of cardiac dysfunction in CIA mice. The electrocardiogram, biochemical, and histochemical analysis proved the cardioprotection effect of LG against RA. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) and fibrotic markers (fibronectin, Collagen I, and Collagen III) in cardiac tissues of CIA mice further corroborated the attenuation of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis by LG. Mechanistic studies showed that LG could inhibit transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 (TGF-\u03b21) and phos-Smad2/3 expression in cardiac tissues of CIA mice. Our study suggested that LG could relieve RA and its cardiac complication probably by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 pathway. All these suggested that LG might be a potential candidate for RA and its cardiac complication therapy."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Systemic inflammation is very closely linked to the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the cardiac changes during the development of arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice to explore the potential role of inflammation on cardiac dysfunction in RA. METHODS: Arthritis severity was evaluated using clinical indices, micro-computed tomography and histopathology. Cardiac function was determined by transthoracic echocardiography at weeks 5, 7, 9 and 11 after immunisation in mice. At week 7 (day 50), mice joints and hearts were removed for pathological study, and cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were isolated using Langendorff perfusion method ex vivo to measure the expression of inflammatory and cardiac-related genes by real time PCR. The expression of key molecule in cardiac dysfunction (\u03b2-MHC) was also tested in H9c2 cardiomyocyte treated with sera derived from CIA mice or RA patients. RESULTS: At day 50 after immunisation, cardiac function in CIA mice was prominently reduced as evidenced by decreased ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), increased left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and internal systolic diameter (LVIDs). Accordingly, enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis were identified in ventricular tissues pathologically, and increased inflammatory gene expression including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-17 and MMP3 was detected in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts from CIA mice. Furthermore, H9c2 cells treated with sera from CIA mice or RA patients exhibited high levels of \u03b2-MHC. CONCLUSIONS: Joint inflammation is associated with an obvious cardiac dysfunction and enhanced inflammation infiltration and inflammatory cytokine production in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts during CIA development. Our data provide the direct evidence that inflammation contributes to the development of cardiac diseases in RA patients."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthropathy associated with articular damage and attendant comorbidities. Even although RA treatment has advanced remarkably over the last decade, a significant proportion of patients still do not achieve sustained remission. The cause of RA is not yet known despite the many potential mechanisms proposed. It has been confirmed that RA is associated with dysregulated immune system and persistent inflammation. Therefore, management of inflammation is always the target of therapy. Sinomenine (SIN) is the prescription drug approved by the Chinese government for RA treatment. A previous study found that SIN was a robust anti-inflammation drug. In this study, we screened the different secretory cytokines using inflammation antibody arrays and qRT-PCR in both LPS-induced and SIN-treated RAW264.7 cells followed by evaluation of the ability of SIN to modulate cytokine secretion in a cell model, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, and RA patients. Several clinical indexes affecting the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) were determined before and after SIN treatment. Clinical indexes, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and DAS28 were compared among RA patients treated with either SIN or methotrexate (MTX). To explore the mechanism of SIN anti-inflammatory function, RA-associated monocyte/macrophage subsets were determined using flow cytometry in CIA mouse model and RA patients, both treated with SIN. The results demonstrated that SIN regulated IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-12 p40, IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, KC (CXCL1), Eotaxin-2, IL-10, M-CSF, RANTES, and MCP-1 secretion in vivo and in vitro and reduced RA activity and DAS28 in a clinical setting. Furthermore, SIN attenuated CD11b+F4/80+CD64+ resident macrophages in the synovial tissue, CD11b+Ly6C+CD43+ macrophages in the spleen and draining lymph nodes of CIA mice. The percentage of CD14+CD16+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reduced by SIN in RA patients. These data indicated that SIN regulates the secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines and monocyte/macrophage subsets, thereby suppressing RA progression. Therefore, along with MTX, SIN could be an alternative cost-effective anti-inflammatory agent for treating RA."

                "title": "Extracorporeal photopheresis reduces inflammation and joint damage in a rheumatoid arthritis murine model.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory reactions and tissue damage in the joints. Long-term drug use in clinical practice is often accompanied by adverse reactions. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy with few side effects, offering a potential and safe therapeutic alternative for RA through the induction of immune tolerance. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of ECP on RA using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) murine model, as well as to explore its immunomodulatory effects in vivo. Additionally, particular attention was given to the significant role of monocytes during the ECP process. METHODS: A murine model of rheumatoid arthritis was established by administering two injections of bovine type II collagen to DBA/1J mice. ECP, ECP-MD (mononuclear cells were depleted during the ECP), MTX, and PBS treatment were applied to the CIA mice. During the treatment process, clinical scores and body weight changes of CIA mice were closely monitored. After six treatment sessions, micro-CT images of the hind paws from live mice were captured. Ankle joints and paws of the mice were collected and processed for histological evaluation. Spleen samples were collected to measure the Th17/Treg cells ratio, and serum samples were collected to assess cytokine and anti-type II collagen IgG levels. Monocytes and dendritic cells populations before and after ECP in vitro were detected by flow cytometry. RESULT: ECP therapy significantly attenuated the progression of CIA, alleviated the severity of clinical symptoms in CIA mice and effectively suppressed synovial hyperplasia, inflammation, and cartilage damage. There was an expansion in the percentage of CD3\u2009+\u2009CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009FoxP3\u2009+\u2009Tregs and a decrease in CD3\u2009+\u2009CD4\u2009+\u2009IL17A\u2009+\u2009Th17 cells in vivo. Furthermore, ECP reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (53.47\u2009\u00b1\u20097.074\u00a0pg/mL vs 5.142\u2009\u00b1\u20091.779\u00a0pg/mL, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and IL-17A (3.077\u2009\u00b1\u20090.401\u00a0pg/mL vs 0.238\u2009\u00b1\u20090.082\u00a0pg/mlL, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared with PBS. Interestingly, the depletion of monocytes during the ECP process did not lead to any improvement in clinical symptoms or histological scores in CIA mice. Moreover, the imbalance in the Th17/Treg cells ratio became even more pronounced, accompanied by an augmented secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A. In vitro, compared with cells without ECP treatment, the proportion of CD11b\u2009+\u2009cells were significantly reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.01), the proportion of CD11c\u2009+\u2009cells were significantly elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.001) 24\u00a0h after ECP treatment. Additionally, the expression of MHC II (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), CD80 (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and CD86 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) was downregulated in CD11c\u2009+\u2009cells 24\u00a0h after ECP treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that ECP exhibits a therapeutic effect comparable to conventional therapy in CIA mice, and the protective mechanisms of ECP against RA involve Th17/Treg cells ratio, which result in decreased IL-6 and IL-17A. Notably, monocytes derived from CIA mice are an indispensable part to the efficacy of ECP treatment, and the proportion of monocytes decreased and the proportion of tolerogenic dendritic cells increased after ECP treatment in vitro."

                "title": "Protection against cartilage and bone destruction by systemic interleukin-4 treatment in established murine type II collagen-induced arthritis.",
                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased production of a range of cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1, which display potent proinflammatory actions that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Although TNF-alpha seems to be the major cytokine in the inflammatory process, IL-1 is the key mediator with regard to cartilage and bone destruction. Apart from direct blockage of IL-1/TNF, regulation can be exerted at the level of modulatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-10. IL-4 is a pleiotropic T-cell derived cytokine that can exert either suppressive or stimulatory effects on different cell types, and was originally identified as a B-cell growth factor and regulator of humoral immune pathways. IL-4 is produced by activated CD4+T cells and it promotes the maturation of TH2 cells. IL-4 stimulates proliferation, differentiation and activation of several cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. IL-4 is also known to be a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 by macrophages and monocytes. Moreover, IL-4 stimulates the synthesis of several cytokine inhibitors such as interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), soluble IL-1-receptor type II and TNF receptors IL-4 suppresses metalloproteinase production and stimulates tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 production in human mononuclear phagocytes and cartilage explants, indicating a protective effect of IL-4 towards extracellular matrix degradation. Furthermore, IL-4 inhibits both osteoclast activity and survival, and thereby blocks bone resorption in vitro. Of great importance is that IL-4 could not be detected in synovial fluid or in tissues. This absence of IL-4 in the joint probably contributes to the disturbance in the Th1/Th2 balance in chronic RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used model of arthritis that displays several features of human RA. Recently it was demonstrated that the onset of CIA is under stringent control of IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that exposure to IL-4 during the immunization stage reduced onset and severity of CIA. However, after cessation of IL-4 treatment disease expression increased to control values. AIMS: Because it was reported that IL-4 suppresses several proinflammatory cytokines and matrix degrading enzymes and upregulates inhibitors of both cytokines and catabolic enzymes, we investigated the tissue protective effect of systemic IL-4 treatment using established murine CIA as a model. Potential synergy of low dosages of anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids and IL-4 was also evaluated. METHODS: DBA-1J/Bom mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen and boosted at day 21. Mice with established CIA were selected at day 28 after immunization and treated for days with IL-4, prednisolone, or combinations of prednisolone and IL-4. Arthritis score was monitored visually. Joint pathology was evaluated by histology, radiology and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). In addition, serum levels of IL-1Ra and anticollagen antibodies were determined. RESULTS: Treatment of established CIA with IL-4 (1microgram/day) resulted in suppression of disease activity as depicted in Figure 1. Of great interest is that, although 1 microgram/day IL-4 had only a moderate effect on the inflammatory component of the disease activity, it strongly reduced cartilage pathology, as determined by histological examination (Fig. 1). Moreover, serum COMP levels were significantly reduced, confirming decreased cartilage involvement. In addition, both histological and radiological analysis showed that bone destruction was prevented (Fig. 1). Systemic IL-4 administration increased serum IL-1Ra levels and reduced anticollagen type II antibody levels. Treatment with low-dose IL-4 (0.1 microgram/day) was ineffective in suppressing disease score, serum COMP or joint destruction. Synergistic suppression of both arthritis severity and COMP levels was noted when low-dose IL-4 was combined with prednisolone (0.05 mg/kg/day), however, which in itself was not effective. DISCUSSION: In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic IL-4 treatment ameliorates disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression was only arrested and not reversed, clear protection against cartilage and bone destruction was noted. This is in accord with findings in both human RA and animal models of RA that show that inflammation and tissue destruction sometimes are uncoupled processes. Of great importance is that, although inflammation was still present, strong reduction in serum COMP was found after exposure to IL-4. This indicated that serum COMP levels reflected cartilage damage, although a limited contribution of the inflamed synovium cannot be excluded. Increased serum IL-1Ra level (twofold) was found after systemic treatment with IL-4, but it is not likely that this could explain the suppression of CIA. We and others have reported that high dosages of IL-1Ra are needed for marked suppression of CIA. As reported previously, lower dosages of IL-4 did not reduce clinical disease severity of established CIA. Of importance is that combined treatment of low dosages of IL-4 and IL-10 appeared to have more potent anti-inflammatory effects, and markedly protected against cartilage destruction. Improved anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with IL-4/prednisolone treatment. In addition, synergistic effects were found for the reduction of cartilage and bone destruction. This indicates that systemic IL-4/prednisolone treatment may provide a cartilage and bone protective therapy for human RA."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of the joint synovial membranes. RA is difficult to prevent or treat; however, blocking proinflammatory cytokines is a general therapeutic strategy. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) is reported to alleviate RA's inflammatory response and is being studied as a non-invasive physical therapy. In this current study, PEMF decreased paw inflammation in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) murine model. PEMF treatment at 10 Hz was more effective in ameliorating arthritis than at 75 Hz. In the PEMF-treated CIA group, the gross inflammation score and cartilage destruction were lower than in the untreated CIA group. The CIA group treated with PEMF also showed lower serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 but not IL-6, IL-17, or TNF-\u03b1. Serum levels of total anti-type II collagen IgG and IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b) remained unchanged. In contrast, tissue protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and TNF-\u03b1 receptor1 (TNFR1) were all lower in the ankle joints of the PEMF-treated CIA group compared with the CIA group. The results of this study suggest that PEMF treatment can preserve joint morphology cartilage and delay the occurrence of CIA. PEMF has potential as an effective adjuvant therapy that can suppress the progression of RA."

Thus, this study is aimed at determining whether systemic RvE1 treatment reduces arthritis onset and severity in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and spontaneous cytokine production by human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial explants. 10-week-old DBA1/J male mice were subjected to CIA and treated systemically with 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg RvE1, 1\u00a0\u03bcg RvE1, 5\u2009mg/kg anti-TNF (positive control group), PBS (negative control group), or with a combination of 1\u2009\u03bcg of RvE1 plus 5\u2009mg/kg anti-TNF using prophylactic or therapeutic strategies. After CIA immunization, mice were treated twice a week by RvE1 or anti-TNF for 10 days. Arthritis development was assessed by visual scoring of paw swelling and histology of ankle joints. Moreover, human RA synovial explants were incubated with 1\u2009nM, 10\u2009nM, or 100\u2009nM of RvE1, and cytokine levels (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, INF-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1) were measured using Luminex bead array. CIA triggered significant inflammation in the synovial cavity, proteoglycan loss, and cartilage and bone destruction in the ankle joints of mice. Prophylactic and therapeutic RvE1 regimens did not ameliorate CIA incidence and severity. Anti-TNF treatment significantly abrogated signs of joint inflammation, bone erosion, and proteoglycan depletion, but additional RvE1 treatment did not further reduce the anti-TNF-mediated suppression of the disease. Treatment with different concentrations of RvE1 did not decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human RA synovial explants in the studied conditions. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that RvE1 treatment was not an effective approach to treat CIA in DBA1/J mice in both prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, no effects were noticed when human synovial explants were incubated with different concentrations of RvE1."

                "abstract": "CONTEXT: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic auto-immune disease, which is characterized by chronic and symmetry synovial inflammation. Crocin has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of crocin on type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CIA rat model was established and randomly divided into five groups with or without crocin treatment (10, 20 or 40\u2009mg/kg), which was started on day 21 after arthritis induction and persisted for 36\u00a0days. The symptoms and molecular mechanisms of CIA and crocin-treated CIA rats were compared and investigated. RESULTS: CIA rats presented severe RA symptoms, including high arthritis score, paw swelling, joint inflammation, bone erosion, chondrocyte death, cartilage destruction, enhanced expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, crocin could mitigate these symptoms. Crocin (40\u2009mg/kg) exhibited the most efficient therapeutic function on CIA rats: the histological scores of joint inflammation, bone erosion, chondrocyte death, cartilage surface erosion, and bone erosion of CIA rats receiving 40\u2009mg/kg crocin treatment were comparable to the normal rats. MMP-1, -3 and -13 protein expression levels of CIA rats with 40\u2009mg/kg crocin treatment were decreased to levels similar to normal rats. Moreover, crocin could also inhibit the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, IL-6 and CXCL8 in serum and ankle tissues of CIA rats. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, crocin exhibits therapeutic potential for RA, by mitigating the symptoms and inhibiting the pro-inflammatory factor expression."

Quercetin (Que) is a major active flavonoid component isolated from HT and is one of the quality control indexes of HT. In the clinical practice of TCM, formulas containing HT are commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent studies have shown that Que exerts antiarthritic effects. However, the mechanism by which Que treatment affects RA is not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the antiarthritic activity of Que in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model and investigate the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antiarthritic activity of Que was evaluated in a CIA mouse model by determining the paw clinical arthritis scores and left ankle thicknesses and by conducting micro-PET imaging and histopathological analysis of ankle joint tissues. The proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17) levels in the serum and ankle joint tissues were measured by ELISA. Mitochondrial oxidative stress was assessed by biochemical methods. Mitochondrial biogenesis was analysed by RT-qPCR. The protein levels of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38, phospho-p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, p65, and phospho-p65 in ankle joint tissues were detected by Western blot analysis. A total of 30 RA patients were recruited to investigate the relationship between the disease activity score (DAS28) and the SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, NRF1, and HMGB1 plasma levels. RESULTS: Que treatment decreased the clinical score and left ankle thickness of CIA mice, attenuated the synovial inflammation and hyperplasia and bone/cartilage destruction in ankle joints, and decreased the secretion of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-13, and IL-17. Mechanistically, Que treatment improved impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function by regulating the SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1/NRF1/TFAM pathway and inhibited inflammation via the HMGB1/TLR4/p38/ERK1/2/NF-\u03baB p65 pathway. Notably, epidemiological data revealed correlations between abnormal circulating levels of SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, NRF1, HMGB1 and RA disease activity in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested a potential role of Que as a dietary therapeutic drug for RA treatment that may act through SIRT1 to target mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, the role of impaired mitochondrial biogenesis in RA was evaluated."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes physical disability in people worldwide. Despite progress made in RA treatment in the past decade, new drugs with high efficacy but few long-term adverse effects are still needed. This study focused on evaluating the therapeutic potential of \u03b1-mangostin on established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. Arthritic DBA/1J mice were orally administered with two doses of \u03b1-mangostin (10 and 40\u202fmg/kg) daily, for 33 days. Alpha-mangostin significantly decreased the clinical score in the short term at both doses and decreased the histopathological score at the higher dose. This improvement was accompanied by a reduction on serum levels of anti-collagen IgG2a autoantibodies and of the production of LIX/CXCL5, IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9, RANTES/CCL5, IL-6 and IL-33 in the joints of CIA mice. Alpha-mangostin also exhibited an anti-oxidant effect decreasing the NADPH oxidase activity and lipid peroxidation and preserving the levels of reduced glutathione in the arthritic joints. In vitro this xanthone demonstrated modulatory properties on LPS-activated dendritic cells, although in Th1 and Th17-polarized lymphocytes promotes a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Altogether this study illustrates the capacity of \u03b1-mangostin to ameliorate the early clinical and histological signs of established CIA by reducing the inflammatory and oxidative responses."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive joint inflammation, resulting in cartilage destruction and bone erosion. It was reported that low-dose radiation modulates immune disease. Here, we investigated whether low-dose whole-body irradiation has preventive and therapeutic effects in collagen-induced RA (CIA) mouse models. Fractionated low-dose irradiation (0.05\u00a0Gy/fraction, total doses of 0.1, 0.5 or 0.8\u00a0Gy) was administered either concurrently with CIA induction by Type II collagen immunization (preventive) or after CIA development (therapeutic). The severity of CIA was monitored using two clinical parameters, paw swelling and redness. We also measured total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukine (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)) in the serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and we evaluated histological changes in the ankle joints by immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Low-dose irradiation reduced CIA clinical scores by up to 41% in the preventive model and by 28% in the therapeutic model, while irradiation in the preventive model reduced the typical CIA incidence rate from 82 to 56%. In addition, low-dose irradiation in the preventive model decreased total IgG by up to 23% and decreased IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 by 69 and 67%, and in the therapeutic model, decreased total IgG by up to 35% and decreased IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 by 59 and 42% with statistical significance (P\u2009<\u20090.01, 0.05 and 0.001). Our findings demonstrate that low-dose radiation has preventive and therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects against CIA by controlling the immune response, suggesting that low-dose radiation may represent an alternative therapy for RA, a chronic degenerative immune disease."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic in\ufb02ammatory synovitis resulting in progressive joint destruction. Persistent synovial inflammation is induced by activation of various in\ufb02ammatory cells. G\u2011protein\u2011coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) is a G\u2011protein\u2011coupled receptor activated by various bile acids, which has been reported to act as a key adaptor in regulating various signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses and a diverse array of physiological processes, including bile acid synthesis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, carcinogenesis, immunity and inflammation. In the present study, TGR5 expression was detected in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and its association with clinical disease activity, histological synovitis severity and radiological joint destruction was analyzed. Subsequently, the role and potential underlying mechanisms of TGR5 in the PBMCs of patients with RA and mice with collagen II\u2011induced arthritis (CIA) were investigated. PBMCs were obtained from 50 patients with RA and 40 healthy controls (HCs). The mRNA and protein expression levels of TGR5 were detected in PBMCs via reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Additionally, the levels of proinflammatory\u00a0cytokines were analyzed by RT\u2011qPCR and enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activation of nuclear factor\u2011\u03baB (NF\u2011\u03baB) and I\u03baB kinase a was determined via western blot analysis. The anti\u2011arthritic and anti\u2011inflammatory effects of LCA on mice with CIA were then investigated. The arthritis score was assessed, and the protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma of mice were detected via ELISA. TGR5 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in the PBMCs of patients with RA compared with in those of the HCs (0.53\u00b10.58 for patients vs. 1.49\u00b10.83 for HCs; P<0.001); similar findings were observed at the protein level. The mRNA expression levels of TGR5 in the PBMCs of patients with RA with a high 28\u2011Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) were significantly decreased compared with in patients with a low DAS28 (0.81\u00b10.65 for low score vs. 0.35\u00b10.46 for high score; P=0.002). Furthermore, TGR5 expression was significantly correlated with the levels of C\u2011reactive protein (r=\u20110.429; P=0.002) and the DAS28 (r=\u20110.383; P=0.006). RT\u2011qPCR and ELISA analyses indicated that lithocholic acid (LCA, 10\u00a0mg/kg/day) attenuated lipopolysaccharide\u2011induced proinflammatory cytokine production via inhibition of NF\u2011\u03baB activity in the PBMCs of patients with RA. In addition, the arthritis score was significantly decreased in LCA\u2011treated CIA mice compared with in non\u2011treated CIA mice. The increased production of tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1, interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2, IL\u20116 and IL\u20118 was significantly reduced in the plasma of LCA\u2011treated CIA mice compared with the control. In conclusion, TGR5 may contribute to the inflammation of PBMCs in patients with RA and mice with CIA."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder that is characterized by persistent recurrence of joint inflammation leading to cartilage and bone destruction. The present anti-arthritis therapies failed to achieve satisfactory remission in all patients; therefore, it is still necessary to develop novel approaches to fulfill the demand in clinic. Here, we reported the therapeutic effects of lactosyl derivative Gu-4, a synthetic compound that was previously identified as a selective inhibitor against leukocyte integrin CD11b, in a bovine type II collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. First, prophylactic administration of Gu-4 (1.2728 mg/kg) to rats by intraperitoneal injection every 2 days from the first day of collagen immunization significantly decreased the incidence of CIA, diminished the mean paw volume increase, and reduced the number of swollen paws. Second, administration of Gu-4 (1.2728 mg/kg) to rats at early-onset stage of CIA prevented the progression of the pathological process of RA, accelerated the remission of paw edema, and declined the arthritis score; after 5 weeks treatment, X-ray and histological examinations were carried out, the ankle joint of hind limb of Gu-4 treated CIA rats exhibited slighter bone erosion and much less inflammatory cell infiltration compared to those of saline treated animals; furthermore, Gu-4 remarkably attenuated the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) in the serum of CIA rats as determined by ELISA. Moreover, we performed in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assay and found that Gu-4 significantly inhibited the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes isolated from CIA rats in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that Gu-4 can effectively ameliorate CIA and might be an alternative option for the treatment of RA."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic destructive inflammatory disease that afflicts over one percent of the world's population. Current pharmacological treatments remain relatively ineffective. In this context, photobiomodulation (PBM) is a potential resource for the treatment of RA. This study investigates investigate the anti-arthritic effects and related mechanisms of PBM on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from RA patients and a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods: The RA-FLSs were irradiated with a light emitting diode (LED) at a wavelength of 610 nm for 20\u00a0min, and the corresponding power intensities were 5 and 10 mW/cm2. After the LED irradiation, cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were performed. Male DBA/1J mice were used to establish an animal model of CIA. Light stimulation with 10 mW/cm2 was applied to the ankle joints via direct contact with the skin for 40\u00a0min, daily for 2 weeks. Results and Discussion: PBM significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced increase in proliferation, migration, and invasion in RA-FLSs, and downregulated the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baappa B (NF-\u03baB) and NLRP3 inflammasome by TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, PBM greatly inhibited the induction and development of CIA, resulting in the inhibition of synovial inflammation and cartilage degradation. PBM therapy decreased the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines. PBM suppressed the translocation of NF-\u03baB and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the ankle joint. Furthermore, PBM showed a more pronounced anti-arthritic effect when combined with methotrexate (MTX), a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). The results showed that the effectiveness of MTX + PBM in CIA is superior to that of either MTX or PBM and that both work synergistically. Therefore, PBM with LED may be a potential therapeutic intervention for against RA."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the imbalance of T cells, which leads to increased pro-inflammatory and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines. Modulating the balance among T cells is crucial for the treatment of RA. Kirenol is a major diterpenoid components of Herba Siegesbeckiae, which has been applied for arthritic therapy for centuries. Since prior research showed Kirenol exhibited anti-inflammatory effect in rats, in this study we have evaluated the effect and mechanism of bioactive Kirenol in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) on modulation of T cells. After immunization with bovine type II collagen (CII), Wistar rats were orally administered saline (CIA group), 2 mg/kg Kirenol or 2 mg/kg prednisolone daily for 30 days. The severity of arthritis was clinically and histologically assessed. The numbers of CD4\u207aCD25\u207aFoxp3\u207a T regulatory cells (Tregs) and IFN\u03b3\u207aCD4\u207a and IL4\u207aCD4\u207a T cells were determined by flow cytometry, the mRNA expression level of Foxp3 was quantified by RT-PCR, cytokine levels were measured by ELISA and CII-induced cell proliferation was quantified in vitro. Kirenol significantly delayed the occurrence and reduced the disease severity of CIA. Histological analysis confirmed Kirenol suppressed joint inflammation and inhibited cartilage and bone destruction, compared to the CIA group. Kirenol also upregulated the mRNA expression of Foxp3, increased the numbers of CD4\u207aCD25\u207aFoxp3\u207a and IL4\u207aCD4\u207a T cells, and reduced the number of IFN\u03b3\u207aCD4\u207a T cells. Kirenol reduced the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A and IL-6 in synovial fluid and TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 in serum, and increased the serum levels of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21. In addition, Kirenol inhibited the ability of CII to induce splenocyte, PBMC and lymph node cell proliferation in vitro, compared to cells from CIA rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that Kirenol may be a potential immunosuppressant for the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis."

METHODS: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was induced in male DBA/1 mice by immunization with type II collagen (ColII). CIA mice were divided into 5 groups (n=10 per a group) with normal, CIA control, PC extract (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg)-treated, and meloxicam (50 mg/kg)-treated as the reference drug. The PC extract or meloxicam were administered orally in CIA mice once a day for 14 days after arthritis induction. Arthritic score, levels of anti-ColII IgG2a antibody, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-17 in the sera of CIA mice were measured. Histopathological changes in the ankle joints of CIA mice were also analyzed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E), safranin-O and immunohistochemistry using anti-TNF-\u03b1 and anti-IL-17 antibodies. RESULTS: The arthritic score was increased in CIA mice in a time-dependent manner, as were the serum levels of anti-ColII IgG2a antibody, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17. However, the oral administration of PC extract at 50 and 100 mg/kg in CIA mice significantly decreased the arthritic scores, and the serum levels of anti-ColII IgG2a, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17 compared with those in the CIA group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Furthermore, histopathological improvement of the joint architecture in CIA mice was observed after administration of PC extract. PC extract also significantly inhibited the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 in the joints of CIA mice by suppressing the expression of their mRNA and proteins. CONCLUSION: PC extract may improve the pathological progression of RA through the inhibition of joint destruction by synovial inflammation and immune-stimulation, therefore, it would be a potential anti-arthritic agent in RA."

SV is also traditional Chinese medicine and Tibetan medicine for the treatment of conjunctivitis, enteritis and rheumatic. For searching complementary and alternative anti-RA drugs, it is necessary to characterize the potential anti-arthritic activity of SV and underlying mechanism involved. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to test the chemical compositions, evaluate the anti-arthritic effects and underlying mechanisms of SV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical compositions of SV were analyzed using liquid chromatography-ion trap-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS-IT-TOF). From day 11 to day 31, SV (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5\u00a0g/kg body weight) and Tripterygium glycosidorum (TG, 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight) were administered orally to the CIA model rats once a day. Thickness of paw and body weights were measured once every two days from day 1 to day 31. Histopathological changes were measured using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Effects of SV on the levels of IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 in serum of CIA rats were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ T cells populations were measured using flow cytometric analysis. To evaluate the possible hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea (UREA) and creatinine (CREA) in CIA rats were also tested using blood auto analyzer. RESULTS: 34 compounds were identified from SV based on LCMS-IT-TOF, and triterpenoids are major anti-arthritic compositions. SV significantly relieved CIA rats' paw swelling without obvious influence on the body weight growth. SV decreased the serum levels of IL-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in CIA rat, and increased the serum levels of IL-4 and IL-10. SV significantly increased and decreased the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+, with no significant effects on CD3+ in lymphocytes of CIA model rats. Moreover, SV simultaneously decreased thymus and spleen indexes and no hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity was observed after short-term treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that SV possesses preventive and therapeutic effect on RA by modulating the inflammatory cytokines, T-lymphocyte, thymus and spleen indexes and shows no hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity."

However, the protective mechanisms of PF on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was not completely known. Thus, we explored deeply the protective mechanisms in a collagen-induced RA (CIA) rat model. CIA was induced in rats by intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen in complete Freund's adjuvant. Later, the CIA rats received oral administration of PF (50 and 100\u202fmg/kg) once a day from the day 21, with the treatment lasting for 14 days.

The results demonstrated that PF treatment significantly ameliorated the symptoms in CIA rats, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and paw swelling, down-regulated the expressions of p-NF-\u03baB p65 and p-MYPT1. The present results revealed that PF could effectively improve collagen-induced RA in rats by inhibiting Rho kinase activation in the joint synovial tissues, in turn down-regulating expression of p-NF-\u03baB p65 and reducing contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Moreover, the mechanisms and targets of active ingredient therapy of AMS for RA were predicted using network pharmacology and then verified using molecular docking. RESULT: In the present study, 12 compounds were detected by UPLC-ESI-IT-MSn, such as quercetin and its derivative which could be potential active ingredients that contribute to the anti-RA properties of AMS. Our in vivo studies on CIA rats revealed that an AMS-H dose of 630\u00a0mg/kg significantly improved joint damage while decreasing the arthritic index and paw swelling. Furthermore, AMS inhibited the INF-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, levels while upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 in serum. Besides, AMS inhibited the protein Bcl-2/Bax, STAT3, and JAK2 levels, and promoted the expression of Caspase3, SOCS1, and SOCS3 in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was found to perform a remarkable function in the AMS therapy of RA as evidenced by enrichment in GO terms and KEGG pathways. Meanwhile, data from molecular docking experiments indicated that the core targets of PIK3CA, JAK2, and SRC bound stably to the active ingredients of mimuone, 4'-methoxy-bavachromanol, and quercetin. CONCLUSION: According to these findings, the AMS could improve joint inflammation in CIA rats, and its underlying mechanism could be linked to the regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, AMS might become a promising agent for alleviating inflammation in RA patients."

Inhibition of the noncanonical I\u03baB kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 and IKK\u03b5 with amlexanox restores insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice and human patients. Here we report that amlexanox improves diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia in Western diet-fed (WD-fed) Ldlr-/- mice and protects against atherogenesis. Amlexanox ameliorated dyslipidemia, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction through synergistic actions that involve upregulation of bile acid synthesis to increase cholesterol excretion. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated an elevated expression of key bile acid synthesis genes. Furthermore, we found that amlexanox attenuated monocytosis, eosinophilia, and vascular dysfunction during WD-induced atherosclerosis. These findings demonstrate the potential of amlexanox as a therapy for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis."

                "abstract": "The common causes of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Metabolic disorders and lipotoxic hepatocyte damage are hallmarks of NAFLD. Even though amlexanox, a dual inhibitor of TRAF associated nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03b5), has been reported to effectively improve obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions in mice models, its molecular mechanism has not been fully investigated. This study was designed to investigate the effects of amlexanox on in vitro nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model induced by treatment of palmitic acid (PA, 0.4 mM), using a trans-well co-culture system of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs). Stimulation with PA significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 in both hepatocytes and KCs, suggesting a potential role of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 in PA-induced NASH progression. Treatment of amlexanox (50 \u03bcM) showed significantly reduced phosphorylation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 and hepatotoxicity as confirmed by decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase released from hepatocytes. Furthermore, PA-induced inflammation and lipotoxic cell death in hepatocytes were significantly reversed by amlexanox treatment. Intriguingly, amlexanox inhibited the activation of KCs and induced polarization of KCs towards M2 phenotype. Mechanistically, amlexanox treatment decreased the phosphorylation of interferon regulator factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-\u03baB in PA-treated hepatocytes. However, decreased phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB, not IRF3, was found in PA-treated KCs upon amlexanox treatment. Taken together, our findings show that treatment of amlexanox attenuated the severity of PA-induced hepatotoxicity in vitro and lipoapoptosis by the inhibition of TBK1/IKK\u03b5-NF-\u03baB and/or IRF3 pathway in hepatocytes and KCs."

The noncanonical I\u03baB kinases IKK-\u025b and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are induced in liver and fat by NF-\u03baB activation upon high-fat diet feeding and in turn initiate a program of counterinflammation that preserves energy storage.

Treatment of obese mice with amlexanox elevates energy expenditure through increased thermogenesis, producing weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and decreased steatosis.

Amlexanox induced weight loss, reduced fatty liver and insulin resistance in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice and has now progressed into clinical testing for the treatment and prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, since amlexanox is a dual IKK\u03b5/TBK1 inhibitor, the specific metabolic contribution of TBK1 is not clear. METHODS: To distinguish metabolic functions unique to TBK1, we examined the metabolic profile of global Tbk1 mutant mice challenged with an obesogenic diet and investigated potential mechanisms for the improved metabolic phenotype. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We report that systemic loss of TBK1 kinase function has an overall protective effect on metabolic readouts in mice on an obesogenic diet, which is mediated by loss of an inhibitory interaction between TBK1 and the insulin receptor."

                "abstract": "Although numerous studies have suggested that canonical I\u03baB kinases (IKK) play a key role in the progression of liver fibrosis, the role of non-canonical IKK\u03b5 and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) on the development and progression of liver fibrosis remains unclear. To demonstrate such issue, repeated injection of CCl4 was used to induce hepatotoxin-mediated chronic liver injury and biliary fibrosis was induced by 0.1% diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine diet feeding for 4\u00a0weeks. Mice were orally administered with amlexanox (25, 50, and 100\u00a0mg/kg) during experimental period. Significantly increased levels of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 were observed in fibrotic livers or hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) isolated from fibrotic livers. Interestingly, amlexanox treatment significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 accompanied by reduced liver injury as confirmed by histopathologic analysis, decreased serum biochemical levels and fibro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, treatment of amlexanox promoted the fibrosis resolution. In accordance with these findings, amlexanox treatment suppressed HSC activation and its related fibrogenic responses by partially inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Furthermore, amlexanox decreased the activation and inflammatory responses in Kupffer cells. Collectively, we found that inhibition of the TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 by amlexanox is a promising therapeutic strategy to cure liver fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leukocytosis, particularly monocytosis, has been shown to promote atherosclerosis in both diabetic and non-diabetic mouse models. We previously showed that hyperglycemia independently promotes monocytosis and impairs the resolution of atherosclerosis. Since patients with chronic diabetes often develop dyslipidemia and also have increased risk for atherosclerosis, we sought to examine how controlling blood glucose affects atherosclerosis development in the presence of severe hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (STZ) in low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) knockout (Ldlr-/-) mice after which they were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks. Control and diabetic mice were treated with vehicle or sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitor (SGLT2i, Phlorizin or Dapagliflozin) for the duration of the diet. RESULTS: Induction of diabetes resulted in a dramatic increase in plasma cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels. These mice also exhibited an increased number of circulating monocytes and neutrophils. Monocytosis was driven by increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Tighter glycemic control by SGLT2i treatment not only reduced monocytosis and atherosclerosis but also improved plasma lipoprotein profile. Interestingly, improved lipoprotein profile was not due to decreased TG synthesis or clearance via low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Lrp) 1 or scavenger receptor class B member (Scarb1) pathways, but likely mediated by heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)-dependent clearance mechanisms in the liver. Further examination of the liver revealed an important role for bile acid transporters (Abcg5, Abcg8) and cytochrome P450 enzymes in the clearance of hepatic cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that tighter glycemic control in diabetes can improve lipoprotein clearance exclusive of Ldlr, likely via HSPG and bile acid pathways, and has an overall net positive effect on atherosclerosis."

                "abstract": "The protein kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 are activated in liver and fat in mouse models of obesity. We have previously demonstrated that treatment with the IKK\u03b5/TBK1 inhibitor amlexanox produces weight loss and relieves insulin resistance in obese animals and patients. While amlexanox treatment caused a transient reduction in food intake, long-term weight loss was attributable to increased energy expenditure via FGF21-dependent beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT). Amlexanox increased FGF21 synthesis and secretion in several tissues. Interestingly, although hepatic secretion determined circulating levels, it was dispensable for regulating energy expenditure. In contrast, adipocyte-secreted FGF21 may have acted as an autocrine factor that led to adipose tissue browning and weight loss in obese mice. Moreover, increased energy expenditure was an important determinant of improved insulin sensitivity by amlexanox. Conversely, the immediate reductions in fasting blood glucose observed with acute amlexanox treatment were mediated by the suppression of hepatic glucose production via activation of STAT3 by adipocyte-secreted IL-6. These findings demonstrate that amlexanox improved metabolic health via FGF21 action in adipocytes to increase energy expenditure via WAT beiging and that adipocyte-derived IL-6 has an endocrine role in decreasing gluconeogenesis via hepatic STAT3 activation, thereby producing a coordinated improvement in metabolic parameters."

In this study, we report that these kinases attenuate \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in white adipose tissue. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of these kinases restored \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and lipolysis attenuated by TNF\u03b1 and Poly (I:C). Conversely, overexpression of the kinases reduced induction of Ucp1, lipolysis, cAMP levels, and phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase in response to isoproterenol or forskolin. Noncanonical IKKs reduce catecholamine sensitivity by phosphorylating and activating the major adipocyte phosphodiesterase PDE3B. In vivo inhibition of these kinases by treatment of obese mice with the drug amlexanox reversed obesity-induced catecholamine resistance, and restored PKA signaling in response to injection of a \u03b2-3 adrenergic agonist. These studies suggest that by reducing production of cAMP in adipocytes, IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 may contribute to the repression of energy expenditure during obesity.

The aim was to explore the IKK\u03b5/NF-\u03baB role and its intervention of LPS and high-fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed on high-fat diet (HFD) combined with or without simultaneously subcutaneous injection of LPS for 18 weeks. Body weight , blood biochemistry parameters, inflammatory mediator and liver lipid deposition were measured to evaluate LPS effect on NAFLD. Furthermore, IKK\u03b5 selective inhibitor amlexanox (AM) was administrated by gavage to HFD\u00a0+\u00a0LPS induced mice. The indicators about metabolism and inflammation were examined and qRT-PCR, immunoblotting assay as well as immunohistochemistry were performed to assess IKK\u03b5/NF-\u03baB activation and downstream gene expression. This study found that low-dose LPS\u00a0+\u00a0HFD aggravated more significant steatosis than simple HFD or high-dose LPS\u00a0+\u00a0HFD. Low-dose LPS exacerbated more prominent inflammation profile including increased IKK\u03b5 and NF-\u03baB expression in liver than HFD. Inhibiting IKK\u03b5/NF-\u03baB signaling with amlexanox significantly prevented HFD\u00a0+\u00a0LPS induced metabolic disorders and hepatic steatosis. LPS-upregulated gene expression involved in glucolipid metabolism could be downregulated by amlexanox. Thus, the present study confirmed long-term combinational administration of subcutaneous low-dose LPS injection and HFD induced NAFLD model which had more significant phenotype in mice than simple HFD or high-dose LPS-induction. Targeting on IKK\u03b5/NF-\u03baB signaling with its inhibitor amlexanox alleviated steatohepatitis, suggesting that IKK\u03b5/NF-\u03baB signaling was responsible for effect of LPS and HFD on NAFLD."

This study was to investigate the protective mechanism of amlexanox in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury (ALI). Mice were intraperitoneally injected with APAP (300\u202fmg/kg, 12\u202fh) to induce ALI and were orally administrated with amlexanox (25, 50 and 100\u202fmg/kg) one hour after APAP treatment. Inhibition of IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 by treatment of amlexanox attenuated APAP-induced ALI as confirmed by decreased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Furthermore, amlexanox significantly decreased hepatocellular apoptosis in injured livers of mice as evidenced by histopathologic observation. Consistently, reduced oxidative stress by amlexanox was observed by increased hepatic glutathione concomitant with decreased levels of malondialdehyde. Amlexanox also enhanced expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target genes including heme oxygenase 1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase in injured livers of mice. Mechanistic insights into the mode of action of amlexanox against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity were involved in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the protective effects of amlexanox on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity were abolished by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Taken together, our findings suggest that amlexanox exerts antioxidative activities against APAP-mediated hepatotoxicity via AMPK/Nrf2 pathway."

The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). MAIN METHODS: NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD\u00a0+\u00a0LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKK\u03b5 and smooth muscle actin-\u03b1 (\u03b1-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and lipid metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKK\u03b5 was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKK\u03b5-NF-\u03baB-TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b1) in HSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study confirmed that IKK\u03b5 was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes."

Amlexanox, a TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) inhibitor, is a strong anti-inflammatory drug. We investigated the role of TBK1 and the potential therapeutic effect of amlexanox in the pathogenesis of PQ-induced ALI. After 30 mg/kg PQ treatment for 72 h, mouse lung pathological injury occurred, and the protein concentration in alveolar lavage fluid was increased. Next, RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were treated with 100 \u03bcM PQ for 24 h, which decreased cell viability. PQ induced oxidative damage and increased IL-1\u03b2, IFN\u03b2, NF-\u03baBp65, IRF3, and pTBK1/TBK1 levels in mouse lungs and RAW264.7 cells. Inhibiting the activation of TBK1 with amlexanox (100 mg/kg in mice and 50 \u03bcM in RAW264.7 cells) attenuated mouse lung injury and decreased the protein concentration in alveolar lavage fluid. Further, amlexanox relieved the oxidative damage in mouse lungs and RAW264.7 cells, reduced the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1\u03b2 and IFN\u03b2, and inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baBp65 and IRF3. These results suggest that TBK1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PQ-induced ALI. Further, amlexanox treatment alleviates PQ-induced ALI by inhibiting the TBK1-NF-\u03baB/IRF3 signalling pathway. Our study provides evidence that TBK1 inhibition by amlexanox alleviates PQ-induced ALI and may be a new therapeutic strategy."

                "abstract": "RATIONALE: Diabetes mellitus increases cardiovascular disease risk in humans and remains elevated despite cholesterol-lowering therapy with statins. Consistent with this, in mouse models, diabetes mellitus impairs atherosclerosis plaque regression after aggressive cholesterol lowering. MicroRNA 33 (miR33) is a key negative regulator of the reverse cholesterol transport factors, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and high-density lipoprotein, which suggested that its inhibition may overcome this impairment. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of miR33 inhibition on atherosclerosis regression in diabetic mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Reversa mice, which are deficient in the low-density lipoprotein receptor and in which hypercholesterolemia is reversed by conditional inactivation of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene, were placed on an atherogenic diet for 16 weeks, then either made diabetic by streptozotocin injection or kept normoglycemic. Lipid-lowering was induced by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene inactivation, and mice were treated with anti-miR33 or control oligonucleotides. Although regression was impaired in diabetic mice treated with control oligonucleotides, anti-miR33 treatment decreased plaque macrophage content and inflammatory gene expression in these mice. The decreased macrophage content in anti-miR33 treated diabetic mice was associated with a blunting of hyperglycemia-induced monocytosis and reduced monocyte recruitment to the plaque, which was traced to an inhibition of the proliferation of bone marrow monocyte precursors associated with the upregulation of their Abca1. CONCLUSIONS: miR33 inhibition overcomes deleterious effects of diabetes mellitus in atherosclerosis regression in mice, which suggests a therapeutic strategy in diabetic patients, who remain at elevated cardiovascular disease risk, despite plasma cholesterol lowering."

                "title": "Nuclear transport modulation reduces hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, and fatty liver.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in blood lead to atherosclerosis and fatty liver, contributing to rising cardiovascular and hepatobiliary morbidity and mortality worldwide. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cell-penetrating nuclear transport modifier (NTM) reduced hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and fatty liver in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice fed a Western diet. NTM treatment led to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels in blood compared with control animals (36% and 53%, respectively; P<0.005) and liver (41% and 34%, respectively; P<0.05) after 8 weeks. Atherosclerosis was reduced by 63% (P<0.0005), and liver function improved compared with saline-treated controls. In addition, fasting blood glucose levels were reduced from 209 to 138 mg/dL (P<0.005), and body weight gain was ameliorated (P<0.005) in NTM-treated mice, although food intake remained the same as that in control animals. The NTM used in this study, cSN50.1 peptide, is known to modulate nuclear transport of stress-responsive transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B, the master regulator of inflammation. This NTM has now been demonstrated to also modulate nuclear transport of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, the master regulators of cholesterol, triglyceride, and fatty acid synthesis. NTM-modulated translocation of SREBPs to the nucleus was associated with attenuated transactivation of their cognate genes that contribute to hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Two-pronged control of inflammation and dyslipidemia by modulating nuclear transport of their critical regulators offers a new approach to comprehensive amelioration of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, fatty liver, and their potential complications."

                "abstract": "Dysfunction of the melanocortin system can result in severe obesity accompanied with dyslipidemia and symptoms of the metabolic syndrome but the effect on vascular atherogenesis is not known. To study the impact of obesity and dyslipidemia on the cardiovascular system, we generated mice double-deficient for the melanocortin type 4 receptor (Mc4rmut mice) and the LDL receptor (Ldlr-/- mice). Mc4rmut mice develop obesity due to hyperphagia. Double-mutant mice (Mc4rmut;Ldlr-/-) exhibited massive increases in body weight, plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and developed atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic lesion size was affected throughout the aortic root and brachiocephalic artery not only under semisynthetic, cholesterol-containing diet but also under cholesterol-free standard chow. The Mc4rmut mice developed a hepatic steatosis which contributes to increased plasma cholesterol levels even under cholesterol-free standard chow. Transcripts of cholesterol biosynthesis components and liver cholesterol levels did not significantly differ between wild-type and all mutant mouse strains but RNA sequencing data and biochemical measurements point to an altered bile acid elimination in Mc4rmut;Ldlr-/-. Therefore, the unchanged endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis together with a reduced hepatic VLDL and LDL-cholesterol clearance most likely led to increased plasma lipid levels and consequently to atherosclerosis in this animal model. Our data indicate that dysfunction of the melanocortin-regulated food intake and the resulting obesity significantly add to the proatherogenic lipoprotein profile caused by LDL receptor deficiency and, therefore, can be regarded as relevant risk factor for atherosclerosis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bempedoic acid (ETC-1002, 8-hydroxy-2,2,14,14-tetramethylpentadecanedioic acid) is a novel low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering compound. In animals, bempedoic acid targets the liver where it inhibits cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase and through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bempedoic acid would prevent diet-induced metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Ldlr-/- mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (42% kcal fat, 0.2% cholesterol) supplemented with bempedoic acid at 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg body weight/day. Treatment for 12 weeks dose-dependently attenuated diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, fatty liver and obesity. Compared to high-fat, high-cholesterol alone, the addition of bempedoic acid decreased plasma triglyceride (up to 64%) and cholesterol (up to 50%) concentrations, and improved glucose tolerance. Adiposity was significantly reduced with treatment. In liver, bempedoic acid prevented cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation, which was associated with increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced fatty acid synthesis. Hepatic gene expression analysis revealed that treatment significantly increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation while suppressing inflammatory gene expression. In full-length aorta, bempedoic acid markedly suppressed cholesteryl ester accumulation, attenuated the expression of proinflammatory M1 genes and attenuated the iNos/Arg1 ratio. Treatment robustly attenuated atherosclerotic lesion development in the aortic sinus by 44%, with beneficial changes in morphology, characteristic of earlier-stage lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Bempedoic acid effectively prevents plasma and tissue lipid elevations and attenuates the onset of inflammation, leading to the prevention of atherosclerotic lesion development in a mouse model of metabolic dysregulation."

                "abstract": "Amlexanox, an anti-inflammatory agent, is widely used for treating aphthous ulcers. Recently, amlexanox has received considerable attention because of its efficacy in mitigating metabolic inflammation via directly suppressing IKK\u03b5/TBK1. However, because the knockdown of IKK\u03b5/TBK1 has no anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed RAW264.7 cells, the mechanism of amlexanox against classical inflammation is independent of IKK\u03b5/TBK1. In this study, we aim to examine the effects of amlexanox on LPS-treated macrophages and in a mouse model of endotoxemia. We found that amlexanox significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, both in vitro and in vivo, while increased interleukin-10 level in LPS-activated macrophages. Mechanistically, amlexanox down-regulated nuclear factor \u03baB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/activator protein-1 signaling by elevating intracellular 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level and subsequently activating protein kinase A. Molecular docking along with fluorescence polarization and enzyme inhibition assays revealed that amlexanox bound directly to phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4B to inhibit its activity. The anti-inflammatory effects of amlexanox could be abolished by the application of cAMP antagonist or PDE4B siRNA. In addition to PDE4B, the activities of PDE1C, 3A, and 3B were directly inhibited by amlexanox. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the clinical utility of amlexanox for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and might contribute to extending the clinical indications of amlexanox."

                "abstract": "Chronic low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of obesity, which is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. The drug amlexanox inhibits I\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to promote energy expenditure and improve insulin sensitivity. Clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in a subset of diabetic patients with underlying adipose tissue inflammation, albeit with moderate potency, necessitating the need for improved analogs. Herein we report crystal structures of TBK1 in complex with amlexanox and a series of analogs that modify its carboxylic acid moiety. Removal of the carboxylic acid or mutation of the adjacent Thr156 residue significantly reduces potency toward TBK1, whereas conversion to a short amide or ester nearly abolishes the inhibitory effects. IKK\u03b5 is less affected by these modifications, possibly due to variation in its hinge that allows for increased conformational plasticity. Installation of a tetrazole carboxylic acid bioisostere improved potency to 200 and 400 nM toward IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, respectively. Despite improvements in the in vitro potency, no analog produced a greater response in adipocytes than amlexanox, perhaps because of altered absorption and distribution. The structure-activity relationships and cocrystal structures described herein will aid in future structure-guided inhibitor development using the amlexanox pharmacophore for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia) is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) plays important roles in hepatic steatosis and cholesterol transport. However, the effect of NgBR overexpression on atherosclerosis remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice infected with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-NgBR expression vector were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by determination of atherosclerosis and the involved mechanisms. RESULTS: We determined that high expression of NgBR by AAV injection mainly occurs in the liver and it can substantially inhibit en face and aortic root sinus lesions. NgBR overexpression also reduced levels of inflammatory factors in the aortic root and serum, and levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acids in the liver and serum. Mechanistically, NgBR overexpression increased the expression of scavenger receptor type BI and the genes for bile acid synthesis, and decreased the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes by reducing sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 maturation in the liver, thereby reducing hypercholesterolemia. In addition, NgBR overexpression activated AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 via the Ca2+ signaling pathway, which inhibited fat synthesis and improved hypertriglyceridemia. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study demonstrates that overexpression of NgBR enhanced cholesterol metabolism and inhibited cholesterol/fatty acid synthesis to reduce hyperlipidemia, and reduced vascular inflammation, thereby inhibiting atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. Our study indicates that NgBR might be a potential target for atherosclerosis treatment."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). MS affects millions of people and causes a great economic and societal burden. There is no cure for MS. We used a novel approach to investigate the therapeutic potential of neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human primitive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. METHODS: MSCs were differentiated into NSCs, labeled with PKH26, and injected into the tail vein of EAE mice. Neurobehavioral changes in the mice assessed the effect of transplanted cells on the disease process. The animals were sacrificed\u00a0two weeks following cell transplantation to collect blood, lymphatic, and CNS tissues for analysis. Transplanted cells were tracked in various tissues by flow cytometry. Immune infiltrates were determined and characterized by H&E and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Levels of immune regulatory cells, Treg and Th17, were analyzed by flow cytometry. Myelination was determined by Luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining. In vivo fate of transplanted cells and expression of inflammation, astrogliosis, myelination, neural, neuroprotection, and neurogenesis markers were investigated by using immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: MSC-derived NSCs expressed specific neural markers, NESTIN, TUJ1, VIMENTIN, and PAX6. NSCs improved EAE symptoms more than MSCs when transplanted in EAE mice. Post-transplantation analyses also showed homing of MSCs and NSCs into the CNS with concomitant induction of\u00a0an anti-inflammatory response, resulting in reducing immune infiltrates. NSCs also modulated Treg and Th17 cell levels in EAE mice comparable to healthy controls. Luxol fast blue staining showed significant improvement in myelination in treated mice. Further analysis showed that NSCs upregulated genes involved in myelination and neuroprotection but downregulated inflammatory and astrogliosis genes more significantly than MSCs. Importantly, NSCs differentiated into neural derivatives and promoted neurogenesis, possibly by modulating BDNF and FGF signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: NSC transplantation reversed the disease process by inducing an anti-inflammatory response and promoting myelination, neuroprotection, and neurogenesis in EAE disease animals. These promising results provide a basis for clinical studies to treat MS using NSCs derived from primitive MSCs."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is a promising novel approach to the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). NSCs can be derived from primary central nervous system (CNS) tissue or obtained by neural differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, the latter having the advantage of readily providing an unlimited number of cells for therapeutic purposes. Using a mouse model of MS, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of NSCs derived from ES cells by two different neural differentiation protocols that utilized adherent culture conditions and compared their effect to primary NSCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by antigen-stimulated splenocytes was reduced in the presence of SVZ-NSCs, while ES cell-derived NSCs exerted differential immunosuppressive effects. Surprisingly, intravenously injected NSCs displayed no significant therapeutic impact on clinical and pathological disease outcomes in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by recombinant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, independent of the cell source. Studies tracking the biodistribution of transplanted ES cell-derived NSCs revealed that these cells were unable to traffic to the CNS or peripheral lymphoid tissues, consistent with the lack of cell surface homing molecules. Attenuation of peripheral immune responses could only be achieved through multiple high doses of NSCs administered intraperitoneally, which led to some neuroprotective effects within the CNS. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Systemic transplantation of these NSCs does not have a major influence on the clinical course of rMOG-induced EAE. Improving the efficiency at which NSCs home to inflammatory sites may enhance their therapeutic potential in this model of CNS autoimmunity."

Cyclic AMP and its analogs enhance regeneration of adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS).

Here, we examined the effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) symptoms, endogenous remyelination, and recruitment of NSCs. EAE was induced by immunizing mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide and pertussis toxin. Proliferative cells within CNS were labeled using repetitive systemic injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) before EAE induction. Myelin staining was performed using Luxol fast blue. The number of nestin(+) and BrdU(+) cells in subventricular zone (SVZ) and olfactory bulb (OB) was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. dbcAMP suppressed EAE progression and decreased the extent of demyelinated plaques in the lumbar spinal cord. EAE induction reduced the number of proliferative cells in SVZ and increased their population in OB. EAE also increased the number of nestin(+) cells in OB. We also found that dbcAMP increased the recruitment of NSCs into the OB and brain parenchyma of EAE mice. Our results suggest dbcAMP as a potential therapy for inducing myelin repair in the context of demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis. Its positive effect seems to be mediated, at least partially, by endogenous neural stem cells and their increased recruitment. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive properties grant mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promising potential for treating autoimmune diseases. As autologous MSCs suffer from limited availability, the readily available allogeneic MSCs isolated from menstrual blood (MB-MSCs) donated by young, healthy individuals offer great potential. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of MB-MSCs as ready-to-use allo-MSCs in multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease developed by the activation of myelin sheath-reactive Th1 and Th17 cells, by application in its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: We assessed the therapeutic effect of MB-MSCs transplanted via either intravenous (i.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route in EAE in comparison with umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs). We used histology to assess myelin sheath integrity and infiltrated immune cells in CNS and flow cytometry to evaluate EAE-associated inflammatory T cells and antigen-presenting cells in lymphoid organs. RESULTS: We observed disease-ameliorating effects of MB-MSCs when transplanted at various stages of EAE (day\u2009-\u20091, 6, 10, and 19), via either i.v. or i.p. route, with a potency comparable to UC-MSCs. We observed reduced Th1 and Th17 cell responses in mice that had received MB-MSCs via either i.v. or i.p. injection. The repressed Th1 and Th17 cell responses were associated with a reduced frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and a suppressed co-stimulatory capacity of pDCs, cDCs, and B cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the readily available MB-MSCs significantly reduced the disease severity of EAE upon transplantation. Thus, they have the potential to be developed as ready-to-use allo-MSCs in MS-related inflammation."

These effects are mediated by instructive cross-talk between MSC and immune and neural cells. Astroglial reaction to injury is a prominent feature of both EAE and MS. Astrocytes constitute a relevant target to control disease onset and progression and, based on their potential to acquire stem cell properties in situ, to foster recovery in the post-acute phase of pathology. We have assessed how MSC impact astrocytes in vitro and ex vivo in EAE. Expression of astroglial factors implicated in EAE pathogenesis was quantified by real-time PCR in astrocytes co-cultured with MSC or isolated from EAE cerebral cortex; astrocyte morphology and expression of activation markers were analyzed by confocal microscopy. The acquisition of neural stem cell properties by astrocytes was evaluated by neurosphere assay. Our study shows that MSC prevented astrogliosis, reduced mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines that sustain immune cell infiltration in EAE, as well as protein expression of endothelin-1, an astrocyte-derived factor that inhibits remyelination and contributes to neurodegeneration and disease progression in MS. Moreover, our data reveal that MSC promoted the acquisition of progenitor traits by astrocytes. These data indicate that MSC attenuate detrimental features of reactive astroglia and, based on the reacquisition of stem cell properties, also suggest that astrocytes may be empowered in their protective and reparative actions by MSC."

                "abstract": "Several animal studies and few pilot clinical trials have tested the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in multiple sclerosis (MS). In almost all of the preclinical studies, healthy animals (or humans) served as donors of the MSCs. This setting does not accurately simulate the clinical situation of autologous transplantation in patients with MS. In the current research we used MSC isolated from mice with EAE in order to mimic human autologous transplantation and to test if the inflammatory process affects the functional properties of MSC. MSC(EAE) were found to retain their mesodermal features (as evidenced by the expression of surface cell markers and their ability to differentiate toward cells of the mesodermal lineage). Moreover, MSC(EAE) were able to support neurite outgrowth in the N2A cell line and to suppress the proliferation of lymphocytes induced by the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Intravenous administration of MSC(EAE) suppressed the clinical course of EAE (0% mortality, disease score 1.09\u00b10.22 vs. 40% mortality and 2.95\u00b10.31 EAE score in saline-treated controls), paralleled by a strong reduction of CNS inflammation and demyelination (9.7\u00b12.79 perivascular cuffs in the treated mice, as compared to 25.8\u00b17.4 in the controls; demyelination area: 1.73\u00b10.3 in MSC(EAE)-treated animals vs. 3.8\u00b10.26 in the controls) and by a significant protection of the axons (axonal density: 1.26\u00b10.24 in the MSC(EAE)-treated animals vs. 3.06\u00b10.38 in the control group). All these beneficial effects were indistinguishable from the effects induced by MSC obtained from healthy syngeneic donors. These data demonstrate that the inflammatory process in EAE does not exert any deleterious effect on the functional/biological properties of the MSC and provide additional support for the use of autologous MSC that are obtained from MS-patients, in future clinical applications."

The mechanisms involved in the capacity of MSCs to inhibit the proliferation of proinflammatory T lymphocytes, which appear responsible for causing autoimmune disease, have yet to be fully elucidated. One of the underlying mechanisms studied recently is the ability of MSCs to generate T regulatory (Treg) cells in vitro and in vivo from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), T-CD4+ and also T-CD8(+) cells. In the present work we investigated the capacity of MSCs to generate Treg cells using T-CD4(+) cells induced to differentiate toward the proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 lineages. METHODS: MSCs were obtained from mouse bone marrow and characterized according to their surface antigen expression and their multilineage differentiation potential. CD4(+) T cells isolated from mouse spleens were induced to differentiate into Th1 or Th17 cells and co-cultured with MSCs added at day 0, 2 or 4 of the differentiation processes. After six days, CD25, Foxp3, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and helios and neuropilin 1 mRNA levels were assessed by RT-qPCR. For the functional assays, the 'conditioned' subpopulation generated in the presence of MSCs was cultured with concanavalin A-activated CD4(+) T cells labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. Finally, we used the encephalomyelitis autoimmune diseases (EAE) mouse model, in which mice were injected with MSCs at day 18 and 30 after immunization. At day 50, the mice were euthanized and draining lymph nodes were extracted for Th1, Th17 and Treg detection by flow cytometry. RESULTS: MSCs were able to suppress the proliferation, activation and differentiation of CD4(+) T cells induced to differentiate into Th1 and Th17 cells. This substantial suppressive effect was associated with an increase of the percentage of functional induced CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and IL-10 secretion. However, using mature Th1 or Th17 cells our results demonstrated that while MSCs suppress the proliferation and phenotype of mature Th1 and Th17 cells they did not generate Treg cells. Finally, we showed that the beneficial effect observed following MSC injection in an EAE mouse model was associated with the suppression of Th17 cells and an increase in the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes when administrated at early stages of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that MSCs contribute to the generation of an immunosuppressive environment via the inhibition of proinflammatory T cells and the induction of T cells with a regulatory phenotype. Together, these results might have important clinical implications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical and experimental studies highlighted the significant therapeutic role of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in neurodegenerative diseases. MSCs possess potent immunomodulatory properties by releasing exosomes, which generate a suitable microenvironment. microRNAs (miRNAs), as one of several effective bioactive molecules of exosomes, influence cellular communication and activities in recipient cells. Recent studies revealed that miRNAs could control the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) via differentiation and function of T helper cells (Th). METHODS: Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of syngeneic-derived BM-MSC in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS by evaluating expression profile of miRNAs, pro- and anti-inflammatory in serum and brain tissues. Three-time scheme groups (6th day, 6th & 12th days, and 12th day, of post-EAE induction) were applied to determine the therapeutic effects of intraperitoneally received 1*106 of BM-MSCs. RESULTS: The expression levels of mature isoforms of miR-193, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-21, and miR-326 showed that BM-MSCs treatment attenuated the EAE clinical score and reduced clinical inflammation as well as demyelination. The improved neurological functional outcome associated with enhanced expression of miR-193 and miR-146a, but decreased expression levels of miR-155, miR-21, and miR-326 were followed by suppressing effects on Th1/Th17 immune responses (reduced levels of IFN-\u03b3and IL-17 cytokine expression) and induction of Treg cells, immunoregulatory responses (increase of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-4) in treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BM-MSCs administration might change expression patterns of miRNAs and downstream interactions followed by immune system modulation. However, there is a need to carry out future human clinical trials and complementary experiments."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is a widespread inflammatory demyelinating disease. Several immunomodulatory therapies are available, including interferon-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod, and mitoxantrone. Although useful to delay disease progression, they do not provide a definitive cure and are associated with some undesirable side-effects. Accordingly, the search for new therapeutic methods constitutes an active investigation field. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to modify the disease course is currently the subject of intense interest. Decidua-derived MSCs (DMSCs) are a cell population obtained from human placental extraembryonic membranes able to differentiate into the three germ layers. This study explores the therapeutic potential of DMSCs. METHODS: We used the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model to evaluate the effect of DMSCs on clinical signs of the disease and on the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the central nervous system. We also compared the inflammatory profile of spleen T cells from DMSC-treated mice with that of EAE control animals, and the influence of DMSCs on the in vitro definition of the Th17 phenotype. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects on the presence of some critical cell types in central nervous system infiltrates. RESULTS: Preventive intraperitoneal injection of DMSCs resulted in a significant delay of external signs of EAE. In addition, treatment of animals already presenting with moderate symptoms resulted in mild EAE with reduced disease scores. Besides decreased inflammatory infiltration, diminished percentages of CD4(+)IL17(+), CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) and CD11b(+)Ly6C(+) cells were found in infiltrates of treated animals. Early immune response was mitigated, with spleen cells of DMSC-treated mice displaying low proliferative response to antigen, decreased production of interleukin (IL)-17, and increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Moreover, lower ROR\u03b3T and higher GATA-3 expression levels were detected in DMSC-treated mice. DMSCs also showed a detrimental influence on the in vitro definition of the Th17 phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: DMSCs modulated the clinical course of EAE, modified the frequency and cell composition of the central nervous system infiltrates during the disease, and mediated an impairment of Th17 phenotype establishment in favor of the Th2 subtype. These results suggest that DMSCs might provide a new cell-based therapy for the control of multiple sclerosis."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage, is a complicated neurological disease of the human central nervous system. Recent interest in adipose stromal/stem cell (ASCs) for the treatment of CNS diseases has promoted further investigation in order to identify the most suitable ASCs. To investigate whether MS affects the biologic properties of ASCs and whether autologous ASCs from MS-affected sources could serve as an effective source for stem cell therapy, cells were isolated from subcutaneous inguinal fat pads of mice with established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS. ASCs from EAE mice and their syngeneic wild-type mice were cultured, expanded, and characterized for their cell morphology, surface antigen expression, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, colony forming units, and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in vitro. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of the cells was assessed in vivo by transplantation into EAE mice. The results indicated that the ASCs from EAE mice displayed a normal phenotype, typical MSC surface antigen expression, and in vitro osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity, while their osteogenic differentiation capacity was reduced in comparison with their unafflicted control mice. The ASCs from EAE mice also demonstrated increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, specifically an elevation in the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and keratin chemoattractant. In vivo, infusion of wild type ASCs significantly ameliorate the disease course, autoimmune mediated demyelination and cell infiltration through the regulation of the inflammatory responses, however, mice treated with autologous ASCs showed no therapeutic improvement on the disease progression."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes demyelination, neuronal damage and white matter loss, but there is still no known cure. Exosomes are 30-200\u00a0nm-sized double-layered membrane vesicles that can easily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Exosomes from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells\uff08UMSCs\uff09 have been found to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) through the action of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory, but its clinical translation has been hampered by their inefficacious accumulation in CNS. Therefore, we developed a TAxI-exos, also known as a TAxI-peptide-chimeric UMSC-exos, for CNS-specific accumulation and curative effect in EAE. We used the EAE model in vivo as well as active T cell and BV-2 cell models in vitro to explore the efficacy and mechanisms. Exosomes from UMSCs with TAxI or DiR labels were given to EAE mice in one dosage (150\u00a0g) prior to the peak at day 15. The mice were sacrificed on day 30 so that spinal cords, spleens, and blood could be taken for analysis of demyelination, inflammation, microglia, T-cell subset proportions, and inflammatory cytokine expression. In vitro, PBMCs and splenocytes isolated from healthy C57BL/6 mice were activated and incubated with 0.15\u00a0mg/mL of UMSC-exos or TAxI-exos for immune mechanism investigations. Activated BV-2 cells were used to investigate the targeting and controlling polarization ability and mechanism of UMSC-exos and TAxI-exos. As expected, TAxI-exos exhibited significantly greater therapeutic action in EAE mice than UMSC-exos due to their improved targeting-ability. The medication reduced T-cell subset proportions and inflammation, reduced active-microglia proportions and promoted M1 to M2 microglial cell polarization through TNF pathway, upregulated IL-4, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and IDO-1 expression, and downregulated IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. The CNS-targeting properties of TAxI-exos and their capacity to inhibit degenerative processes in EAE mice have considerable potential therapeutic value for MS and other CNS illnesses."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Minocycline ameliorates the clinical severity of MS and exhibits antiinflammatory, neuroprotective activities, and good tolerance for long-term use, whereas it is toxic to the CNS. Recently, the immunomodulation and neuroprotection capabilities of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were shown in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we evaluated whether the combination of hBM-MSCs and a low-dose minocycline could produce beneficial effects in EAE mice. METHODS: The sensitivity of hBM-MSCs to minocycline was determined by an established cell-viability assay. Minocycline-treated hBM-MSCs were also characterized with flow cytometry by using MSC surface markers and analyzed for their multiple differentiation capacities. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by using immunization with MOG35-55. Immunopathology assays were used to detect the inflammatory cells, demyelination, and neuroprotection. Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin-10 (IL-10), the hallmark cytokines that direct Th1 and Th2 development, were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to elucidate the cell apoptosis in the spinal cords of EAE mice. RESULTS: Minocycline did not affect the viability, surface phenotypes, or differentiation capacity of hBM-MSCs, while minocycline affected the viability of astrocytes at a high dose. In vivo efficacy experiments showed that combined treatment, compared to the use of minocycline or hBM-MSCs alone, resulted in a significant reduction in clinical scores, along with attenuation of inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the combined treatment with hBM-MSCs and minocycline enhanced the immunomodulatory effects, which suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and conversely increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). In addition, TUNEL staining also demonstrated a significant decrease of the number of apoptotic cells in the combined treatment compared with either treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of hBM-MSCs and minocycline provides a novel experimental protocol to enhance the therapeutic effects in MS."

                "abstract": "Demyelination and remyelination play pivotal roles in the pathological process of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a well-established animal model of MS. Although increasing evidence shows that various stimuli can promote the activation/induction of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the central nervous system, the potential contributions of these cells to remyelination following inflammatory injury remain to be fully investigated. In the present study, using an adult mouse model of EAE induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, we investigated whether adult NSPCs in the spinal cord can lead to remyelination under inflammatory conditions. Immunohistochemistry showed that cells expressing the NSPC marker Nestin appeared after MOG peptide administration, predominantly at the sites of demyelination where abundant inflammatory cells had accumulated, whereas Nestin+ cells were rarely present in the spinal cord of PBS-treated control mice. In vitro, Nestin+ NSPCs obtained from EAE mice spinal cords could differentiate into multiple neural lineages, including neurons, astrocytes, and myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. Using the Cre-LoxP system, we established a mouse strain expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under the control of the Nestin promoter and investigated the expression patterns of YFP-expressing cells in the spinal cord after EAE induction. At the chronic phase of the disease, immunohistochemistry showed that YFP+ cells in the injured regions expressed markers for various neural lineages, including myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. These results show that adult endogenous NSPCs in the spinal cord can be subject to remyelination under inflammatory conditions, such as after EAE, suggesting that endogenous NSPCs represent a therapeutic target for MS treatment."

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-characterized animal model to study the etiology and pathogenesis of MS. This model can also be used to investigate various therapeutic approaches for MS. Herein; we have treated a score 3 EAE mouse model with an embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor. Clinical analysis showed recovery of the EAE model of MS following transplantation. We analyzed the proteome of spinal cords of healthy and EAE samples before and after transplantation. Proteome analysis revealed that expressions of 86 spinal cord protein spots changed in the EAE or transplanted mouse compared to controls. Mass spectrometry resulted in identification of 72 proteins. Of these, the amounts of 27 differentially expressed proteins in EAE samples returned to sham levels after transplantation, suggesting a possible correlation between changes at the proteome level and clinical signs of EAE in transplanted mice. The recovered proteins belonged to various functional groups that included disturbances in ionic and neurotransmitter release, apoptosis, iron hemostasis, and signal transduction. Our results provided a proteomic view of the molecular mechanisms of EAE recovery after stem cell transplantation. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we applied proteomics to analyze the changes in proteome pattern of EAE mouse model after embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor transplantation. Our proteome results clearly showed that the expression levels of several differentially expressed proteins in EAE samples returned to sham levels after transplantation, which suggested a possible correlation between changes at the proteome level and decreased clinical signs of EAE in transplanted mice. These results will serve as a basis to address new questions and design new experiments to elucidate the biology of EAE and recovery after transplantation. A thorough understanding of stem cell-mediated therapeutic mechanisms might result in the development of more efficacious therapies for MS than are currently available."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) engineered with secreted Klotho (SKL) in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. EAE was induced in mice. MSCs or MSCs engineered with SKL (SKL-MSCs) were administered to EAE mice at the onset of disease. Hematoxylin-eosin and luxol fast blue staining were performed to evaluate histopathological changes. Expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines was determined in the spinal cord using real-time PCR. Spinal cords were then processed for immunohistochemistry of the aforementioned cytokines. The frequencies of Th1, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells were evaluated by flow cytometry of the spleen. The results showed that SKL-MSCs decreased clinical scores and reduced demyelination and inflammatory infiltration in the spinal cord more significantly than MSCs. Compared to MSCs, SKL-MSCs also exhibited a more profound capability of decreasing expression of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17 and increasing expression of IL-10 in the spinal cord with an enhanced homing to the inflamed tissue. Moreover, SKL-MSCs decreased the frequencies of Th1 and Th17 cells and increased the frequency of Treg cells in the spleen more potently than MSCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SKL overexpression enhances the therapeutic potential of MSCs, as evidenced by significantly improved disease severity, decreased inflammation and tissue damage in the spinal cord, and a promoted shift in the Th17/Treg balance towards the anti-inflammatory Treg side in the EAE mice."

Currently, effective therapeutic strategy was poorly found in MS. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is widely used to study the pathogenesis of MS. Cumulative research have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem Cells (BMSCs) transplantation could treat EAE animal models, but the mechanism was divergent. Here, we systematically evaluated whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to alleviate the symptoms of EAE mice. We used Immunofluorescence staining to detect MAP-2, GFAP, and MBP to evaluate whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The effect of BMSCs transplantation on inflammatory infiltration and demyelination in EAE mice were detected by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, respectively. Inflammatory factors expression was detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR, respectively. Our results showed that BMSCs could be induced to differentiate into neuron cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte in vivo and in vitro, and BMSCs transplanted in EAE mice were easier to differentiate than normal mice. Moreover, transplanted BMSCs reduced neurological function scores and disease incidence of EAE mice. BMSCs transplantation alleviated the inflammation and demyelination of EAE mice. Finally, we found that BMSCs transplantation down-regulated the levels of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, and up-regulated the levels of anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. In conclusion, this study found that BMSCs could alleviate the inflammatory response and demyelination in EAE mice, which may be achieved by the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in EAE mice."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been shown that Th17 cells are critical for EAE pathogenesis. Mice lacking CXCR3 develop aggravated EAE compared with wild-type (WT) mice. This study investigated the effect of CXCR3 on Th17 expansion during EAE and further addressed the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Both active EAE and adoptive-transfer EAE experiments were employed for studying EAE pathogenesis in WT and CXCR3(-/-) mice. Demyelination and leukocyte infiltration in the spinal cord of mice were analyzed by luxol fast blue staining and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Glial cells expressing CXCR3 in the spinal cord were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. Cytokine and chemokine levels in the spinal cord were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The glial cell line U87MG was employed for studying the CXCR3 signaling-mediated mechanism regulating Th17 expansion. RESULTS: CXCR3(-/-) mice exhibited more severe EAE and had significantly increased central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating Th17 cells compared with WT mice. Adoptive-transfer experiments showed that CXCR3(-/-) recipient mice that received Th17 cells polarized from splenocytes of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunized CXCR3(-/-) mice or MOG-immunized WT mice always developed more severe EAE and had significantly increased CNS-infiltrating Th17 cells compared with WT recipient mice that received Th17 cells from the same origin. Furthermore, during EAE, the number of activated glial cells was increased in the CNS of MOG-immunized CXCR3(-/-) mice, and CXCR3-deficient glial cells expressed increased levels of cytokine genes required for Th17 expansion and recruitment. Finally, we found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation elicited by CXCR3 signaling in U87MG cells attenuated the activation of NF-\u03baB, a key transcription factor critical for the induction of IL-23 and CCL20, which are required for Th17 cell expansion and recruitment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a previously unrecognized role of CXCR3 signaling in glial cells in negatively regulating Th17 cell expansion during EAE. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to its well-known role in the recruitment of immune cells, CXCR3 in CNS glial cells plays a critical role in restraining the pro-Th17 cytokine/chemokine milieu during EAE, thereby diminishing Th17 cell expansion in the CNS and suppressing disease development."

The underlying mechanism of pathogenesis remains unclear and there are currently no effective treatments. The development of neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation provides a promising strategy to treat neurodegenerative disease. However, the limited availability of NSCs prevents their application in neural disease therapy. In this study, we generated NSCs from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and transplanted these cells into mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. The results showed that transplantation of iPSC-derived NSCs dramatically reduced T cell infiltration and ameliorated white matter damage in the treated EAE mice. Correspondingly, the disease symptom score was greatly decreased, and motor ability was dramatically rescued in the iPSC-NSC-treated EAE mice, indicating the effectiveness of using iPSC-NSCs to treat MS. Our study provides pre-clinical evidence to support the feasibility of treating MS by transplantation of iPSC-derived NSCs. "

            "abstract": "Metabolic alterations could profoundly affect immune functions and influence the progression and outcome of autoimmune diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms and their therapeutic potential remain to be defined. Here, we show that phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase interacting protein 1 (Pik3ip1), a newly identified negative immune regulator, is notably down-regulated in several major autoimmune diseases through a previously unidentified mechanism mediated by interleukin-21/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17) pathway. Down-regulation of Pik3ip1 in T cells causes a major metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis, leading to their overactivation and aggressive disease progression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. Suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (Hif1\u03b1) or pharmacologic inhibition of glycolysis could reverse these phenotypes and largely mitigate EAE severity. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized role of Pik3ip1 in metabolic regulation that substantially affects the inflammatory loop in the autoimmune setting and identifies the Pik3ip1/Hif1\u03b1/glycolysis axis as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of autoimmune diseases."

Several negative regulators have been reported to intricately constrain the overactivation of PI3K pathway. Phosphatidylinoinosidine-3-kinase interacting protein 1 (PIK3IP1), as a unique transmembrane protein, is a newly discovered negative regulator of PI3K pathway. PIK3IP1 negatively regulates PI3K activity by directly binding to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. It has been reported that PIK3IP1 is frequently low expressed in tumors and autoimmune diseases. In tumor cells and impaired cardiomyocyte, PIK3IP1 inhibits cell proliferation and survival. Consistently, the expression of PIK3IP1 is related with the condition of cancer. In addition, PIK3IP1 inhibits the inflammatory response and immune function via maintaining the quiescent state of immune cells. Thus, low expression of PIK3IP1 represents the severe condition of autoimmune diseases. PIK3IP1 is regulated by transcription factors, epigenetic factors or micro-RNAs to facilitate its normal function in different cellular contexts. This review integrates the total findings on PIK3IP1 in different disease, and summaries the structure, biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of PIK3IP1."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune disease involving immune dysregulation of the pathogenic T helper 17 (Th17) versus protective T regulatory (Treg) cell subsets, besides other cellular aberrations. Studies on the mechanisms underlying these changes have unraveled the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the disease process. We describe here a gene expression- and bioinformatics-based study showing that celastrol, a natural triterpenoid, acting via MAPK pathway regulates the downstream genes encoding serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), which plays a vital role in Th17/Treg differentiation, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a neurotrophic factor, thereby offering protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)\u00a0in mice. METHODS: We first tested the gene expression profile of splenocytes of EAE mice in response to the disease-related antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and then examined the effect of celastrol on that profile. RESULTS: Interestingly, celastrol reversed the expression of many MOG-induced genes involved in inflammation and immune pathology. The MAPK pathway involving p38MAPK and ERK was identified as one of the mediators of celastrol action. It involved suppression of SGK1 but upregulation of BDNF, which then contributed to protection against EAE. CONCLUSION: Our results not only provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis, but also offer promising therapeutic targets for MS."

                "abstract": "Although it has been demonstrated that cAMP pathway affect both adaptive and innate cell functions, the role of this pathway in the regulation of T-cell-mediated central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammation, such as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), remains unclear. It is also unclear how cAMP pathway affects the function of CD4 T cells in vivo at the site of inflammation. We found that adenylyl cyclase activator Forskolin besides inhibition of functions autoimmune CD4 T cells also upregulated microRNA (miR)-124 in the CNS during EAE, which is associated with M2 phenotype of microglia/macrophages. Our study further established that in addition to direct influence of cAMP pathway on CD4 T cells, stimulation of this pathway promoted macrophage polarization toward M2 leading to indirect inhibition of function of T cells in the CNS. We demonstrated that Forskolin together with IL-4 or with Forskolin together with IL-4 and IFN\u03b3 effectively stimulated M2 phenotype of macrophages indicating high potency of this pathway in reprogramming of macrophage polarization in Th2- and even in Th1/Th2-mixed inflammatory conditions such as EAE. Mechanistically, Forskolin and/or IL-4 activated ERK pathway in macrophages resulting in the upregulation of M2-associated molecules miR-124, arginase (Arg)1, and Mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1), which was reversed by ERK inhibitors. Administration of Forskolin after the onset of EAE substantially upregulated M2 markers Arg1, Mrc1, Fizz1, and Ym1 and inhibited M1 markers nitric oxide synthetase 2 and CD86 in the CNS during EAE resulting in decrease in macrophage/microglia activation, lymphocyte and CD4 T cell infiltration, and the recovery from the disease. Forskolin inhibited proliferation and IFN\u03b3 production by CD4 T cells in the CNS but had rather weak direct effect on proliferation of autoimmune T cells in the periphery and in vitro, suggesting prevalence of indirect effect of Forskolin on differentiation and functions of autoimmune CD4 T cells in vivo. Thus, our data indicate that Forskolin has potency to skew balance toward M2 affecting ERK pathway in macrophages and indirectly inhibit pathogenic CD4 T cells in the CNS leading to the suppression of autoimmune inflammation. These data may have also implications for future therapeutic approaches to inhibit autoimmune Th1\u2009cells at the site of tissue inflammation."

Here we show that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is essential for in vitro and in vivo IL-17 production by regulating IL-17 synthesis in CD4 T cells through the activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E/MAPK-interacting kinase (eIF-4E/MNK) pathway. We also show that p38 MAPK activation is required for the development and progression of both chronic and relapsing-remitting forms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, we show that regulation of p38 MAPK activity specifically in T cells is sufficient to modulate EAE severity. Thus, mechanisms other than the regulation of gene expression also contribute to Th17 cell effector functions and, potentially, to the pathogenesis of other Th17 cell-mediated diseases."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by a global increasing incidence driven by relapsing-remitting disease in females. Investigators have described p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as a key regulator of inflammatory responses in autoimmunity, but its role in the sexual dimorphism in MS or MS models remains unexplored. METHODS: Toward this end, we used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal animal model of MS, combined with pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of p38 MAPK activity and transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK selectively ameliorated EAE in female mice. Conditional deletion studies demonstrated that p38\u03b1 signaling in macrophages/myeloid cells, but not T cells or dendritic cells, mediated this sexual dimorphism, which was dependent on the presence of adult sex hormones. Analysis of CNS inflammatory infiltrates showed that female but not male mice lacking p38\u03b1 in myeloid cells exhibited reduced immune cell activation compared with controls, whereas peripheral T-cell priming was unaffected in both sexes. Transcriptomic analyses of myeloid cells revealed differences in p38\u03b1-controlled transcripts comprising female- and male-specific gene modules, with greater p38\u03b1 dependence of proinflammatory gene expression in females. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate a key role for p38\u03b1 in myeloid cells in CNS autoimmunity and uncover important molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in disease pathogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway represents a novel target for much needed disease-modifying therapies for MS."

It has been previously indicated that many factors, including oxidative stress and p38MAPK-SGK1 pathway, contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. METHODS: This study, using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model system, was aimed at investigating the molecular mechanisms determining interaction p38MAPK-SGK1 pathway and oxidative stress in MS pathogenesis. C57BL/6 mice was immunized with MOG35-55 peptide for EAE induction, which was followed by determination of the effect of treatment with classic p38 inhibitor SB203580 and antioxidant tempol on the development and progression of EAE. RESULTS: Our experiments showed a dynamic change of immune inflammation, oxidative stress and p38MAPK-SGK1 pathway involvement in EAE demonstrating that p38MAPK-SGK1 pathway and oxidative stress contribute to the demyelination in central nerve system caused by Th17 inflammatory responses in a synergistic way. The administration of SB203580 and Tempol both markedly suppressed the progression of EAE. Furthermore, tempol showed a strong inhibiting effect to the p38MAPK-SGK1 pathway similar to SB203580 suggesting that oxidative stress exacerbates EAE via the activation of p38MAPK-SGK1 pathway. CONCLUSION: Cumulatively, our results show that oxidative stress p38MAPK-SGK1 signaling pathway may be a central player in EAE and even in MS."

                "abstract": "There has been a marked increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the past half-century. Although the underlying genetic basis of this class of diseases has recently been elucidated, implicating predominantly immune-response genes, changes in environmental factors must ultimately be driving this increase. The newly identified population of interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) helper T cells (TH17 cells) has a pivotal role in autoimmune diseases. Pathogenic IL-23-dependent TH17 cells have been shown to be critical for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, and genetic risk factors associated with multiple sclerosis are related to the IL-23-TH17 pathway. However, little is known about the environmental factors that directly influence TH17 cells. Here we show that increased salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) concentrations found locally under physiological conditions in vivo markedly boost the induction of murine and human TH17 cells. High-salt conditions activate the p38/MAPK pathway involving nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5; also called TONEBP) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) during cytokine-induced TH17 polarization. Gene silencing or chemical inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5 or SGK1 abrogates the high-salt-induced TH17 cell development. The TH17 cells generated under high-salt conditions display a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype characterized by the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2. Moreover, mice fed with a high-salt diet develop a more severe form of EAE, in line with augmented central nervous system infiltrating and peripherally induced antigen-specific TH17 cells. Thus, increased dietary salt intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development of autoimmune diseases through the induction of pathogenic TH17 cells."

IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the induction of neural Ag-specific Th1 differentiation and pathogenesis of CNS demyelination in EAE and MS. Curcumin (1,7-Bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic phytochemical isolated from the rhizome of the medicinal plant Curcuma longa. It has profound anti-inflammatory activity and been traditionally used to treat inflammatory disorders. In this study we have examined the effect and mechanism of action of curcumin on the pathogenesis of CNS demyelination in EAE. In vivo treatment of SJL/J mice with curcumin significantly reduced the duration and clinical severity of active immunization and adoptive transfer EAE. Curcumin inhibited EAE in association with a decrease in IL-12 production from macrophage/microglial cells and differentiation of neural Ag-specific Th1 cells. In vitro treatment of activated T cells with curcumin inhibited IL-12-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2, tyrosine kinase 2, and STAT3 and STAT4 transcription factors. The inhibition of Janus kinase-STAT pathway by curcumin resulted in a decrease in IL-12-induced T cell proliferation and Th1 differentiation. These findings highlight the fact that curcumin inhibits EAE by blocking IL-12 signaling in T cells and suggest its use in the treatment of MS and other Th1 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases."

We have previously shown that the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is elevated in T cells from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In MS and EAE, the failure of autoimmune cells to undergo apoptosis is thought to exacerbate clinical symptoms and contribute to disease progression and CNS tissue damage. Antisense-mediated knockdown of XIAP, in vivo, increases the susceptibility of effector T cells to apoptosis, thus attenuating CNS inflammation and thereby alleviating the clinical signs of EAE. We report for the first time, generation of transgenic mice whereby the ubiquitin promoter drives expression of XIAP (ubXIAP), resulting in increased XIAP expression in a variety of tissues, including cells comprising the immune system. Transgenic ubXIAP mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) in complete Freund's adjuvant and monitored daily for clinical symptoms of EAE over a 21-day period. The severity of EAE was increased in ubXIAP mice relative to WT-littermates, suggesting that XIAP overexpression enhanced the resistance of T cells to apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, T cells derived from MOG35-55-immunized ubXIAP mice and cultured in the presence of antigen were more resistant to etoposide-mediated apoptosis compared to WT-littermates. This work identifies XIAP is an important apoptotic regulator in EAE and a potential pharmacological target for treating autoimmune diseases such as MS."

Recent reports suggest that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) / serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling pathway contributes to the pathology of MS through regulation of immunity. However, the role of this signaling pathway in MS-related macrophage activation and polarization has not been studied.

Generation of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying sh-p38 or sh-SGK1 under the control of a CD68 promoter successfully knockdown p38 or SGK1 levels in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with AAV-sh-p38 or AAV-sh-SGK1 abolished the effects of Chitin on macrophage polarization and the severity of EAE.

Although several microRNAs (miRNAs) with aberrant expression have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of MS and EAE, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of abnormal miRNA expression in astrocytes upon IL-17 stimulation remain unclear. In the present study, we detected the changes of miRNA expression profiles both in the brain tissue of EAE mice and in cultured mouse primary astrocytes stimulated with IL-17 and identified miR-873 as one of the co-up-regulated miRNAs in vivo and in vitro. The overexpression of miR-873, demonstrated by targeting A20 (TNF\u03b1-induced protein 3, TNFAIP3), remarkably reduced the A20 level and promoted NF-\u03baB activation in vivo and in vitro as well as increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-2, and MCP-1/5). More importantly, silencing the endogenous miR-873 or A20 gene with lentiviral vector of miR-873 sponge (LV-miR-873 sponge) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of A20 (LV-A20 shRNA) in vivo significantly lessened or aggravated inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-873 induced by IL-17 stimulation promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines and aggravates the pathological process of EAE mice through the A20/NF-\u03baB pathway, which provides a new insight into the mechanism of inflammatory damage in MS.

AMPKalpha1 is predominantly expressed in T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), which are primarily involved in EAE disease progression. AMPK is lost at protein level in spleen macrophages, total T cells and their subsets (CD4, CD8 and regulatory T cells) isolated from EAE afflicted animals compared to control, without affecting its mRNA levels suggesting that the loss of AMPK protein is the result of posttranscriptional modification. To examine its pathological relevance in inflammatory disease, EAE was induced in wild type (+/+) and AMPKalpha1 null mice (-/-) using MOG(35-55) peptide. AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice exhibited severe EAE disease with profound infiltration of mononuclear cells compared to wild type mice however, AMPKalpha2 is not involved in enhancing the severity of the disease. Spleen cells isolated from AMPKalpha1(-/-) immunized mice exhibited a significant induction in the production of IFNgamma.

Auto-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells acquire pathogenic IFN\u03b3-producing- (Type I) and IL-17A-producing- (Type 17) effector phenotypes in MS and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although MSC have been extensively demonstrated to suppress pathogenic effector CD4+ T cells and CD4+ T cell-mediated EAE, surprisingly few studies have addressed their modulation of effector CD8+ T cells represented in MS or their impact on CD8+ T cell-mediated EAE. We find that MSC differentially modulate CD8+ T cell development depending on effector T cell subtype. MSC drive activated low-IFN\u03b3 producers toward an enhanced high-IFN\u03b3 Tc1-like phenotype but strongly inhibit the production of IL-17A and Tc17 polarization in vitro. These observations are underscored by differential MSC modulation of T cell activation, proliferation, and signature transcription factor up-regulation. In addition, effector CD8+ T cells co-cultured with MSC exhibited increased production of IL-2, a molecule known to enhance IFN\u03b3, yet suppress IL-17A, production. Based on these in vitro effects on CD8+ T cells, we next evaluated their impact on the severity of EAE. To better evaluate CD8+ T cells, we immunized mice with MOG37-50 , which is a CD8-targeted epitope. Our results revealed a worsening of disease, consistent with their in vitro stimulation of Tc1 cells. These findings highlight the emerging duality of MSC in immune modulation and provide implications for their future use in immune-related diseases."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell autoimmune, inflammatory, and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Currently available therapies have partially effective actions and numerous side reactions. Inosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside, has immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and analgesic properties. Herein, we evaluated the effect of inosine on the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model of MS. Inosine (1 or 10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated twice a day for 40\u00a0days. Immunological and inflammatory responses were evaluated by behavioral, histological, immunohistochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting analysis. The administration of inosine exerted neuroprotective effects against EAE by diminishing clinical signs, including thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, as well as weight loss typical of the disease. These beneficial effects of inosine seem to be associated with the blockade of inflammatory cell entry into the CNS, especially lymphocytes, thus delaying the demyelinating process and astrocytes activation. In particular, up-regulation of IL-17 levels in the secondary lymphoid tissues, a result of EAE, was prevented by inosine treatment in EAE mice. Additionally, inosine consistently prevented A2AR up-regulation in the spinal cord, likely, through an ERK1-independent pathway. Altogether, these results allow us to propose that this endogenous purine might be a putative novel and helpful tool for the prevention of autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS. Thus, inosine could have considerable implications for future therapies of MS, and this study may represent the starting point for further investigation into the role of inosine and adenosinergic receptors in neuroinflammation processes. Graphical Abstract Preventive treatment with inosine inhibits the development and progression of EAE in C57Bl/6 mice. Furthermore, neuroinflammation and demyelinating processes were blocked by inosine treatment. Additionally, inosine consistently inhibited IL-17 levels in peripheral lymphoid tissue, as well as IL-4 levels and A2AR up-regulation in the spinal cord, likely, through an ERK1-independent pathway.

Recently, we characterized a novel protein that we call PI3K Interacting Protein 1 (PIK3IP1), which binds to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K and reduces its activity in vitro. Little is known about the role of PIK3IP1 in normal and neoplastic growth in vivo. Proper liver function and development depend on intact PI3K signal transduction; when dysregulated, the PI3K pathway is linked to the development of liver cancer. To begin to dissect the contribution of PIK3IP1 to hepatic PI3K signaling in vivo and to liver tumorigenesis in particular, we formulated the following hypothesis: because PIK3IP1 down-regulates PI3K signaling and uncontrolled PI3K signaling is associated with liver cancer, then PIK3IP1-mediated down-regulation of the PI3K pathway should inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. To test this idea, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing PIK3IP1 in hepatocytes in a mouse strain prone to develop HCC. Isolated PIK3IP1 transgenic mouse hepatocytes showed blunted PI3K signaling, DNA synthetic activity, motility, and survival compared with controls. In vivo, spontaneous liver tumorigenesis was significantly dampened in the transgenic animals. This was accompanied by decreased hepatic PI3K activity and reduced hepatocyte proliferation in the transgenics compared with controls. We also observed that human HCC expressed less PIK3IP1 protein than adjacent matched liver tissue. Our data show that PIK3IP1 is an important regulator of PI3K in vivo, and its dysregulation can contribute to liver carcinogenesis."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are chronic neuroinflammatory autoimmune diseases characterized by axonal loss, demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). Overactivation of CD4(+)T cells, especially the Th1 and Th17 subsets, is thought to play a causal role in this disease. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-\u03b2 treatment in EAE. IFN-\u03b2 significantly inhibits disease severity, and decreases levels of CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6 and CXCR3 in the CNS. This was associated with fewer Th1/Th17 cells expressing these chemokine receptors. Furthermore, levels of their corresponding ligands CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL20, CCL22 and CXCL10 were also reduced, coinciding with reduced CNS inflammation and demyelination. Chemokine expression significantly correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b2 reduces CCL2/CCL5 induced-T cell migration by inhibiting p38-MAPK and ERK1/2 activation. Our results reveal that IFN-\u03b2 reduces the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors expressed by encephalitogenic Th1/Th17 cells, thereby decreasing their migration into the CNS. "

                "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase blockers from the AG 126/AG-556 tyrphostin family are shown to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in primary rat astrocytes cultures. The tyrphostin AG-556 which was previously shown to be effective against sepsis in mice and dogs also show excellent efficacy in inhibiting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. AG-556 does not block the activation of JNK/SAPK and of p38/HOG and therefore seems to act at a target down stream to these kinases which is activated in stress or at a target on an obligatory parallel pathway. These findings together with previous results showing inhibition of sepsis in mice and dogs suggest that protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) blockers of the AG-556 family may be considered in the management of human autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

                "abstract": "IL-17 plays critical roles in host defenses, combating bacterial and fungal infections, as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The signaling adaptor SAP is essential for normal immune homeostasis and mutations within SH2D1A, the locus encoding this protein, result in serious and sometimes fatal syndromes, including X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and severe cases of common variable immunodeficiency. However, the precise cellular basis of how SAP deficiency contributes to immune dysfunction remains incompletely understood. In this study, we found that CD4 and CD8 T cells lacking SAP had a diminished capacity to differentiate into IL-17-producing Th17 and T cytotoxic (Tc17) cells relative to wild-type lymphocytes. The use of costimulating SLAM Abs was found to augment the differentiation of IL-17-secreting effectors in wild-type but not Sh2d1a(-/-) splenic T cells under IL-17-polarizing conditions. In addition, SAP's regulation of IL-17-secreting T cells was shown to be a T cell-intrinsic role, as purified naive Sh2d1a(-/-) CD4 and CD8 T cells were inherently defective at converting into Th17 and Tc17 cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Sh2d1a(-/-) mice were protected from EAE and exhibited greatly decreased numbers of CNS-infiltrating Th17 and Tc17 effector T cells and reduced disease severity. Collectively, these results suggest that SLAM-SAP signaling drives the differentiation and function of Th17 and Tc17 cells in vitro and in vivo and contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in EAE.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune regulatory disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The main pathological features include demyelination and neurodegeneration, and the pathogenesis is associated with astrocytic neuroinflammation. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) is one of the conjugated bile acids in animal bile, and it is not clear whether TCDCA could improve MS by inhibiting the activation of astrocytes. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of TCDCA on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-a classical animal model of MS, and to probe its mechanism from the aspect of suppressing astrocytic neuroinflammation. It is expected to prompt the potential application of TCDCA for the treatment of MS. RESULTS: TCDCA effectively alleviated the progression of EAE and improved the impaired neurobehavior in mice. It mitigated the hyperactivation of astrocytes and down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6 in the brain cortex. In the C6 astrocytic cell line induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TCDCA treatment dose-dependently decreased the production of NO and the protein expression of iNOS and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). TCDCA consistently inhibited the mRNA expressions of COX2, iNOS and other inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, TCDCA decreased the protein expression of phosphorylated serine/threonine kinase (AKT), inhibitor of NF\u03baB \u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB). And TCDCA also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB. Conversely, as an inhibitor of the G-protein coupled bile acid receptor Gpbar1 (TGR5), triamterene eliminated the effects of TCDCA in LPS-stimulated C6 cells. CONCLUSION: TCDCA improves the progress of EAE by inhibiting the astrocytic neuroinflammation, which might be exerted by the regulation of TGR5 mediated AKT/NF\u03baB signaling pathway. These findings may prompt the potential application of TCDCA for MS therapy by suppressing astrocyte inflammation."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: According to the Tang Dynasty classics Dietetic Material Medica and the Ming Dynasty classics Compendium of Materia Medica records, bear bile powder (BBP) has been used to treat a variety of diseases, such as febrile seizures, the pathogenesis of which is associated to neuroinflammation. However, the mechanism of BBP on alleviating neuroinflammation remains unclear. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Microglia can be activated by peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanism of BBP in inhibiting LPS-induced microglia inflammation in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-microglia inflammatory effects and mechanism of BBP were assessed in LPS-treated BV2 microglial cells and in LPS-treated mice. The mRNA expression levels of the inflammatory factor and the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), takeda G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB\u0251), protein kinase B (AKT) in BV2 cells, mouse hippocampus and cortex were detected. The NF-\u03baB transcription activity and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation were observed. RESULTS: Our findings showed that BBP reduces branched process retraction and NO in LPS-treated BV2 cells, inhibits the protein expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. Moreover, we observed that BBP decreases tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels, deceases iNOS and COX-2 protein levels, increases TGR5 protein levels, suppresses the phosphorylation of AKT, NF-\u03baB and I\u03baB\u0251 protein in microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Further, we found that triamterene, the inhibitor of TGR5, abolishes the effects of BBP in LPS- treated BV2 cells. CONCLUSION: BBP inhibits LPS-induced microglia activation, and the mechanism of its action is partly through TGR5/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway."

                "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people. In particular, increasing evidence has showed that astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. As a precious traditional Chinese medicine, bear bile powder (BBP) has a long history of use in clinical practice. It has numerous activities, such as clearing heat, calming the liver wind and anti-inflammation, and also exhibits good therapeutic effect on convulsive epilepsy. However, whether BBP can prevent the development of PD has not been elucidated. Hence, this study was designed to explore the effect and mechanism of BBP on suppressing astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in a mouse model of PD. PD-like behavior was induced in the mice by intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (30 mg\u00b7kg-1) for five days, followed by BBP (50, 100, and 200 mg\u00b7kg-1) treatment daily for ten days. LPS stimulated rat C6 astrocytic cells were used as a cell model of neuroinflammation. THe results indicated that BBP treatment significantly ameliorated dyskinesia, increased the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and inhibited astrocyte hyperactivation in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD mice. Furthermore, BBP decreased the protein levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and up-regulated the protein levels of takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) in the SN. Moreover, BBP significantly activated TGR5 in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased the protein levels of GFAP, iNOS and COX2, as well as the mRNA levels of GFAP, iNOS, COX2, interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in LPS-stimulated C6 cells. Notably, BBP suppressed the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB\u03b1) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) proteins in vivo and in vitro. We also observed that TGR5 inhibitor triamterene attenuated the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of BBP on LPS-stimulated C6 cells. Taken together, BBP alleviates the progression of PD mice by suppressing astrocyte-mediated inflammation via TGR5."

                "abstract": "Gypenoside IX (GP IX) is a pure compound isolated from Panax notoginseng. Gypenosides have been implicated to benefit the recovery of enormous neurological disorders. By suppressing the activation of astrocytes, gypenosides can improve the cognitive impairment. However, so far, little is known about whether GP IX could restrain the inflammatory responses in astrocytes or reactive astrogliosis. In present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of GP IX were investigated in reactive astrocytes induced by proinflammatory mediators both in vitro and in vivo. GP IX significantly reduced the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) at either protein or mRNA level in glial cell line C6 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/TNF-\u03b1 combination. It also alleviated the astrogliosis and decreased the production of inflammatory mediators in brain cortex of LPS-treated mice. Further study disclosed that GP IX inhibited nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) and reduced its transcriptional activity. Meanwhile, GP IX significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of NF\u03baB, inhibitor of kappa B (I\u03baB), Akt, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) under inflammatory conditions both in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicated that GP IX might suppress reactive astrogliosis by suppressing Akt/p38 MAPK/NF\u03baB signaling pathways. And GP IX might be a promising drug candidate or prodrug for the therapy of neuroinflammatory disorders characterized with reactive astrogliosis."

                "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein family member, is indispensable for the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Therefore, inhibiting BRD4 may be a prospective therapeutic approach for modulating the inflammatory response and regulating the course of MS. dBET1, a newly synthesized proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), exhibits effectively degrades of BRD4. However, the precise effects of dBET1 on MS require further investigation. Therefore, we assessed the effect of dBET1 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a typical MS experimental model. Our findings revealed that BRD4 is mainly expressed in astrocytes and neurons of the spinal cords, and is up-regulated in the spinal cords of EAE mice. The dBET1 attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of astrocytic pro-inflammatory mediators and inhibited deleterious molecular activity in astrocytes. Correspondingly, dBET1, used in preventive and therapeutic settings, alleviated the behavioral symptoms in EAE mice, as demonstrated by decreased demyelination, alleviated leukocyte infiltration, reduced microglial and astrocyte activation, and diminished inflammatory mediator levels. In addition, dBET1 corrected the imbalance in peripheral T cells and protected blood-brain barrier integrity in EAE mice. The underlying mechanism involved suppressing the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinase /extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and nuclear factor kappa B pathways. In summary, our data strongly suggests that dBET1 is a promising treatment option for MS."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is one of the most prominent characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelination disease. As one of the main active ingredients in Astragali radix, total flavonoids of Astragalus (TFA) has multiple pharmacological effects such as immunomodulation, anti-inflammation and and anti-tumor. However, little is known about whether TFA could inhibit microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in MS. PURPOSE: This study was aimed to elucidate whether TFA could inhibit microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in MS. STUDY DESIGN: In the present study, we explored the protective effect of TFA on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, in mice for the first time, and discussed its mechanism from the aspect of anti-microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. METHODS: The mice received oral administration of TFA (25 and 50 mg/kg) daily from two days before immunization and continued until day 21 post-immunization. The effect of TFA on EAE in mice and its mechanism were investigated by ELISA, Western blot, real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: TFA were shown to alleviate the severity of EAE in mice. It inhibited the excessive activation of microglia both in spinal cords of EAE mice and in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells, evidenced by weakening the production of inflammatory mediators such as NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 markedly at either protein or mRNA level. Further study demonstrated that TFA repressed the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF\u03baB, and inhibited the activation of AKT and JNK signaling in BV-2 cells induced by LPS. The agonists of AKT and JNK, anisomycin and SC79, could partly abolish the inhibitory effect of TFA on the production of inflammatory mediators in BV-2 cells induced by LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results clarified that TFA inhibited microglia-mediated inflammation in EAE mice probably through deactivating JNK/AKT/NF\u03baB signaling pathways. The novel findings may lay a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of TFA in the treatment of MS."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginsenosides are main active compounds of Panax ginseng with pharmacological effects on immunological/neurological diseases. Recently, ginsenoside-Re (G-Re) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, whether G-Re has an effect on multiple sclerosis (MS), a representative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), has not been revealed yet. PURPOSE AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacological effects of G-Re and related molecular mechanisms using a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide-immunized experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bEND.3 cells as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). RESULTS: G-Re attenuated motor impairment of EAE, demyelination, and inflammation in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re reduced infiltration/activation of microglia/macrophages and decreased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES), and enzymes (iNOS) in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re inhibited alterations of BBB constituents (such as astrocytes, cell adhesion molecule (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), and tight junctional molecules (occludin and zonula occludens-1)) and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways in spinal cords of EAE mice and LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. Interestingly, combination treatment with G-Re and TLR4 inhibitor (TAK242) significantly inhibited the upregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway in LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. TLR4 inhibitor- and activator-treated EAE mice showed conflicting behavior patterns. CONCLUSION: G-Re might alleviate motor impairment of EAE and its pathological/inflammatory events in the spinal cord by preventing BBB disruption via downregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. These findings for the first time suggest that G-Re might be a potential therapeutic for MS through maintenance of BBB integrity."

                "abstract": "The signaling axis of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been an important component in overcoming diabetes, and recent reports have uncovered novel beneficial roles of this signaling axis in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia, accelerating processes for exendin-4 repositioning. Here, we studied whether multiple sclerosis (MS) could be a complement to the CNS disorders that are associated with the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis. Both components of the signaling axis, GLP-1 and GLP-1R proteins, are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the spinal cord of normal mice. In particular, they are abundant in Iba1-positive microglia. Upon challenge by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, the mRNA expression of both GLP-1 and GLP-1R was markedly downregulated in EAE-symptomatic spinal cords, indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in EAE. Such a downregulation obviously occurred in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia, a main cell type to express both GLP-1 and GLP-1R, further indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in activated microglia. To investigate whether increased activity of GLP-1R has a therapeutic benefit, exendin-4 (5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.p.), a GLP-1R agonist, was administered daily to EAE-symptomatic mice. Exendin-4 administration to symptomatic EAE mice significantly improved the clinical signs of the disease, along with the reversal of histopathological sequelae such as cell accumulation, demyelination, astrogliosis, microglial activation, and morphological transformation of activated microglia in the injured spinal cord. Such an improvement by exendin-4 was comparable to that by FTY720 (3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), a drug for MS. The neuroprotective effects of exendin-4 against EAE were also associated with decreased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, all of which are usually upregulated in injured sites of the EAE spinal cord. Interestingly, exendin-4 exposure similarly reduced mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-stimulated microglia. Furthermore, exendin-4 administration significantly attenuated activation of NF-\u03baB signaling in EAE spinal cord and LPS-stimulated microglia. Collectively, the current study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of exendin-4 for MS by reducing immune responses in the CNS, highlighting the importance of the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for MS."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain inflammation plays a central role in multiple sclerosis (MS). Dimethylfumarate (DMF), the main ingredient of an oral formulation of fumaric acid esters with proven therapeutic efficacy in psoriasis, has recently been found to ameliorate the course of relapsing-remitting MS. Glial cells are the effector cells of neuroinflammation; however, little is known of the effect of DMF on microglia and astrocytes. The purpose of this study was to use an established in vitro model of brain inflammation to determine if DMF modulates the release of neurotoxic molecules from microglia and astrocytes, thus inhibiting glial inflammation. METHODS: Primary microglial and astrocytic cell cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of neonatal rats. The control cells were treated with LPS, an accepted inducer of pro-inflammatory properties in glial cells, and the experimental groups with LPS and DMF in different concentrations. After stimulation/incubation, the generation of nitric oxide (NO) in the cell culture supernatants was determined by measuring nitrite accumulation in the medium using Griess reagent. After 6 hours of treatment RT-PCR was used to determine transcription levels of iNOS, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA in microglial and astrocytic cell cultures initially treated with DMF, followed after 30 min by LPS treatment. Moreover, we investigated possible involvement of the ERK and Nrf-2 transduction pathway in microglia using western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pretreatment with DMF decreased synthesis of the proinflammatory mediators iNOS, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 at the RNA level in activated microglia and astrocytes in vitro, associated with a decrease in ERK phosphorylation in microglia. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of DMF may be in part functionally attributable to the compound's ability to inhibit expression of multiple neuroinflammatory mediators in brain of MS patients."

METHODS: We investigated whether 4-O-methylhonokiol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg in 0.05% ethanol) prevents memory dysfunction and amyloidogenesis on AD model mice by intraperitoneal LPS (250 \u03bcg/kg daily 7 times) injection. In addition, LPS-treated cultured astrocytes and microglial BV-2 cells were investigated for anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic effect of 4-O-methylhonkiol (0.5, 1 and 2 \u03bcM). RESULTS: Oral administration of 4-O-methylhonokiol ameliorated LPS-induced memory impairment in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 4-O-methylhonokiol prevented the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory proteins; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as activation of astrocytes (expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAP) in the brain. In in vitro study, we also found that 4-O-methylhonokiol suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2 as well as the production of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-1\u03b2 in the LPS-stimulated cultured astrocytes. 4-O-methylhonokiol also inhibited transcriptional and DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB via inhibition of I\u03baB degradation as well as p50 and p65 translocation into nucleus of the brain and cultured astrocytes. Consistent with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation, 4-O-methylhonokiol inhibited LPS-induced A\u03b21-42 generation, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase activities, and expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), BACE1 and C99 as well as activation of astrocytes and neuronal cell death in the brain, in cultured astrocytes and in microglial BV-2 cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 4-O-methylhonokiol inhibits LPS-induced amyloidogenesis via anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Thus, 4-O-methylhonokiol can be a useful agent against neuroinflammation-associated development or the progression of AD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The bile acid conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a neuroprotective agent in different animal models of stroke and neurological diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory properties of TUDCA in the central nervous system (CNS) remain unknown. METHODS: The acute neuroinflammation model of intracerebroventricular (icv) injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C57BL/6 adult mice was used herein. Immunoreactivity against Iba-1, GFAP, and VCAM-1 was measured in coronal sections in the mice hippocampus. Primary cultures of microglial cells and astrocytes were obtained from neonatal Wistar rats. Glial cells were treated with proinflammatory stimuli to determine the effect of TUDCA on nitrite production and activation of inducible enzyme nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NF\u03baB luciferase reporters. We studied the effect of TUDCA on transcriptional induction of iNOS and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA as well as induction of protein expression and phosphorylation of different proteins from the NF\u03baB pathway. RESULTS: TUDCA specifically reduces microglial reactivity in the hippocampus of mice treated by icv injection of LPS. TUDCA treatment reduced the production of nitrites by microglial cells and astrocytes induced by proinflammatory stimuli that led to transcriptional and translational diminution of the iNOS. This effect might be due to inhibition of the NF\u03baB pathway, activated by proinflammatory stimuli. TUDCA decreased in vitro microglial migration induced by both IFN-\u03b3 and astrocytes treated with LPS plus IFN-\u03b3. TUDCA inhibition of MCP-1 expression induced by proinflammatory stimuli could be in part responsible for this effect. VCAM-1 inmunoreactivity in the hippocampus of animals treated by icv LPS was reduced by TUDCA treatment, compared to animals treated with LPS alone. CONCLUSIONS: We show a triple anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA on glial cells: i) reduced glial cell activation, ii) reduced microglial cell migratory capacity, and iii) reduced expression of chemoattractants (e.g., MCP-1) and vascular adhesion proteins (e.g., VCAM-1) required for microglial migration and blood monocyte invasion to the CNS inflammation site. Our results present a novel TUDCA anti-inflammatory mechanism, with therapeutic implications for inflammatory CNS diseases."

                "abstract": "Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a flavonoid with numerous pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammation, yet its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation remains unknown. In this study, the effects of ISL on inhibiting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD were evaluated in the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia. Our results showed that ISL prevented behavioral deficits and excessive microglial activation in MPTP-treated mice. Moreover, ISL was found to prevent the elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and mitigate the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB), and inhibitor of NF\u03baB protein \u0251 (I\u03baB\u0251) in the substantia nigra and striatum of MPTP-treated mice and LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Meanwhile, in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells, ISL inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). In addition, the agonist of JNK partly abolished the inhibitory effects of ISL in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Our results demonstrated that ISL inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD models probably through deactivating JNK/AKT/NF\u03baB signaling pathways. The novel findings suggest the therapeutic potential of ISL for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD."

                "abstract": "Microglia are important macrophages to defend against pathogens in the central nervous system (CNS); however, persistent or acute inflammation of microglia lead to CNS disorders via neuronal cell death. Therefore, we theorized that a good strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders would be to target inflammatory mediators from microglia in disease. Consequently, we investigated whether isobutyrylshikonin (IBS) attenuates the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Treatment with IBS inhibited the secretion of NO and prostaglandin E2 (as well as the expression of their key regulatory genes), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Isobutyrylshikonin also suppressed LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 in addition to blocking the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. Pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, showed the down-regulation of LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 messenger RNA by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. This indirectly suggests that IBS-mediated NF-\u03baB inhibition is the main signaling pathway involved in the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression. In addition, IBS attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, which are upstream molecules of NF-\u03baB, in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. The functional aspects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were analyzed with LY294002, which is a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor that attenuated LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. These data suggest that an IBS-mediated anti-inflammatory effect may be involved in suppressing the PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain inflammation plays a central role in numerous brain pathologies, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Microglial cells and astrocytes are the effector cells of neuroinflammation. They can be activated also by agents such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor (PPAR) pathways are involved in the control of the inflammatory processes, and PPAR-beta seems to play an important role in the regulation of central inflammation. In addition, PPAR-beta agonists were shown to have trophic effects on oligodendrocytes in vitro, and to confer partial protection in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. In the present work, a three-dimensional brain cell culture system was used as in vitro model to study antibody-induced demyelination and inflammatory responses. GW 501516, a specific PPAR-beta agonist, was examined for its capacity to protect from antibody-mediated demyelination and to prevent inflammatory responses induced by IFN-gamma and LPS. METHODS: Aggregating brain cells cultures were prepared from embryonal rat brain, and used to study the inflammatory responses triggered by IFN-gamma and LPS and by antibody-mediated demyelination induced by antibodies directed against myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The effects of GW 501516 on cellular responses were characterized by the quantification of the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible NO synthase (i-NOS), PPAR-beta, PPAR-gamma, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), and high molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H). GFAP expression was also examined by immunocytochemistry, and microglial cells were visualized by isolectin B4 (IB4) and ED1 labeling. RESULTS: GW 501516 decreased the IFN-gamma-induced up-regulation of TNF-alpha and iNOS in accord with the proposed anti-inflammatory effects of this PPAR-beta agonist. However, it increased IL-6 m-RNA expression. In demyelinating cultures, reactivity of both microglial cells and astrocytes was observed, while the expression of the inflammatory cytokines and iNOS remained unaffected. Furthermore, GW 501516 did not protect against the demyelination-induced changes in gene expression. CONCLUSION: Although GW 501516 showed anti-inflammatory activity, it did not protect against antibody-mediated demyelination. This suggests that the protective effects of PPAR-beta agonists observed in vivo can be attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties rather than to a direct protective or trophic effect on oligodendrocytes."

MS is considered to be resulted from significant inflammatory response. Paricalcitol (Pari) is a vitamin D2 analogue, which has been indicated to show anti-inflammatory activities in kidney and heart diseases. In the present study, if Pari could ameliorate the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was investigated. Here, the C57BL/6 mice were immunized using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55). Subsequently, Pari was intraperitoneally injected into the mice. As for in vitro analysis, RAW264.7 and Jurkat cells were incubated with Pari together with corresponding stimulus. The results indicated that Pari administration reduced the paralytic severity, neuropathology and apoptosis in MOG-treated mice compared to the MOG single group. Pari also exhibited a significantly inhibitory effect on immune cell infiltration, glial cell activation, expression of pro-inflammatory factors and the activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). The expression of pro-inflammatory regulators and the translocation of NF-\u03baB from cytoplasm into nuclear in RAW264.7 and Jurkat cells under specific stimulation was clearly down-regulated by Pari incubation. Furthermore, we found that suppressing NF-\u03baB with its inhibitor combined with Pari could further reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and associated proteins. These data illustrated that Pari could diminish MOG-triggered EAE, as well as macrophages and T cells activation through blocking NF-\u03baB activation. Collectively, Pari might have therapeutic effects in mouse models with MS."

                "abstract": "An increasing amount of evidence has emerged to suggest that neuroinflammatory process is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Activated microglia and astrocytes are found in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease brains as well as in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Although reactive astrocytes are involved in the progression of PD, the role of reactive astrocytes in neuroinflammation of PD has received limited attention to date. Recently, Glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) was identified as a crucial regulator of the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism by which 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induces inflammatory response in astrocytes and observe the anti-inflammatory effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on 6-OHDA-treated astrocytes. In the present study, we found that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was markedly upregulated in the presence of 6-OHDA. Moreover, our results revealed that proinflammatory molecules including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2), prostaglandins E2 (PGE2), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were obviously increased in astrocytes exposed to 6-OHDA. Western blot analysis revealed that 6-OHDA significantly increased dephosphorylation/activation of GSK-3\u03b2 as well as the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65. Besides, GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor LiCl and SB415286 inhibited the GSK-3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, leading to the reduction of proinflammatory molecules in 6-OHDA-activated astrocytes. These results confirmed that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor LiCl and SB415286 provide protection against neuroinflammation in 6-OHDA-treated astrocytes. Therefore, GSK-3\u03b2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PD. "

                "abstract": "Astrocytes are important components of the innate immune response in the central nervous system (CNS), involving in the inflammatory and neurotoxic responses that occur in CNS diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies have shown that SARM1 plays a critical role in axonal degeneration and inflammation. However, the detailed role of astrocytic SARM1 in MS remains unclear. Here, we established the MS model of mice - experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and found that SARM1 was upregulated in astrocytes of the spinal cords of EAE mice. Moreover, conditional knockout of astrocytic SARM1 (SARM1GFAP-CKO mice, SARM1Aldh1L1-CKO mice) delayed EAE with later onset, alleviated the inflammatory infiltration, and inhibited the demyelination and neuronal death. Mechanically, RNA-seq revealed that the expression of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was upregulated in SARM1-/- astrocytes. Western blot and immunostaining further confirmed the upregulation of GDNF in spinal cord astrocytes of SARM1GFAP-CKO EAE mice. Interestingly, the downregulation of GDNF by streptozotocin (STZ, a drug used to downregulate GDNF) treatment worsened the deficits of SARM1GFAP-CKO EAE mice. These findings identify that astrocytic SARM1 promotes neuroinflammation and axonal demyelination in EAE by inhibiting the expression of GDNF, reveal the novel role of SARM1/GDNF signaling in EAE, and provide new therapeutic ideas for the treatment of MS."

                "abstract": "Interleukin 17 (IL-17), produced mainly by T helper 17 (Th17) cells, is increasingly recognized as a key regulator in various autoimmune diseases, including human multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although several microRNAs (miRNAs) with aberrant expression have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of MS and EAE, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of abnormal miRNA expression in astrocytes upon IL-17 stimulation remain unclear. In the present study, we detected the changes of miRNA expression profiles both in the brain tissue of EAE mice and in cultured mouse primary astrocytes stimulated with IL-17 and identified miR-873 as one of the co-up-regulated miRNAs in vivo and in vitro. The overexpression of miR-873, demonstrated by targeting A20 (TNF\u03b1-induced protein 3, TNFAIP3), remarkably reduced the A20 level and promoted NF-\u03baB activation in vivo and in vitro as well as increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-2, and MCP-1/5). More importantly, silencing the endogenous miR-873 or A20 gene with lentiviral vector of miR-873 sponge (LV-miR-873 sponge) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of A20 (LV-A20 shRNA) in vivo significantly lessened or aggravated inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-873 induced by IL-17 stimulation promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines and aggravates the pathological process of EAE mice through the A20/NF-\u03baB pathway, which provides a new insight into the mechanism of inflammatory damage in MS.

                "abstract": "Microglia activation is closely linked to ischemia, various chronic neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and many other central nervous system diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that depressing the microglial inflammatory response could be an effective treatment for inflammatory disorders. The integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 inhibitor LXW7 has a neuroprotective effect; however, its anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanism remain unclear. Thus, we examined whether LXW7 would inhibit inflammatory cytokines and mediators, and we evaluated the potential mechanisms of its neuroprotective effects. Nitrite analysis revealed LXW7 reduced the nitric oxide (NO) level. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) suggested that LXW7 suppressed the expression of proinflammatory genes for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1\u03b2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and anti-inflammatory gene interleukin 10 (IL-10) at the messenger ribonucleic acid level. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results demonstrated that LXW7 treatment reduced the expression of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 at the protein level. Western blotting was conducted to confirm the upregulation of inflammatory factors, including iNOS and COX-2 at the protein level. LXW7 inhibited major genes in the Akt/NF-\u03baB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/ mitogen-activated protein kinases (JNK/MAPK) signaling pathways. Immunofluorescence revealed that LXW7 inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Thus, LXW7 effectively alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory damage and had neuroprotective effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of LXW7 may be associated with the inhibition of microglial activation via Akt/NF-\u03baB and JNK/MAPK signaling pathways by blocking integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor. The present study's findings suggest that LXW7 has a substantial therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is defined as innate immune system activation in the central nervous system, and is a complex response involved in removing pathogens, toxic components, and dead cells by activating microglial cells. However, over-activated microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, because they release large amounts of neurotoxic factors. Thus, inhibiting microglial activation may represent an attractive approach for preventing neuroinflammatory disorders. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of narciclasine (NA) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation by evaluating related markers and neurotoxic factors. METHODS: BV-2 cells were pre-incubated with NA at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 \u00b5M for 1h, and then co-treated with LPS for 12 h. Cellular medium and lysates were measured using a nitric oxide assay, enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, kinase activity assay, luciferase assay, and immunofluorescence assay. C57BL/6N mice were orally administered NA and intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and the cerebral cortex was examined using western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. RESULTS: NA showed novel pharmacological activity, inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-18, NO, and PGE2, but increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 in LPS-induced microglial cells. Moreover, NA also attenuated the LPS-induced mRNA and proteins of iNOS and COX-2. The mechanistic study indicated that NA attenuates the secretion of pro-inflammatory factor by down-regulating the Akt/IKK/NF-\u03baB and JNK signaling pathways, and directly inhibits the catalytic activity of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2. Furthermore, we found that NA also reduced the expression of the microglial markers Iba-1, COX-2, and TNF-\u03b1 in the mouse brain. CONCLUSION: NA inhibits the over-expression of pro-inflammatory factors but it promotes anti-inflammatory cytokines by down-regulating the Akt/IKK/NF-\u03baB and JNK signaling pathways in experimental models. Thus, NA may be a potential candidate for relieving neuroinflammation."

Although IL-1 blockade has shown promise in ameliorating these symptoms and improving patients' quality of life, there is an urgent need for more effective, long-lasting treatments. We developed a lentivirus (LV)-mediated gene transfer strategy using transplanted autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) as a source of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for systemic delivery to tissues and organs. Transplantation of mouse and human HSPCs transduced with an IL-1RA-encoding LV ensured stable IL-1RA production while maintaining the clonogenic and differentiation capacities of HSPCs in vivo. We examined the efficacy of cell-mediated IL-1RA delivery in three models of IL-1-dependent inflammation, for which treatment hindered neutrophil recruitment in an inducible model of gout, prevented systemic and multi-tissue inflammation in a genetic model of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and reduced disease severity in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate HSPC-mediated IL-1RA delivery as a potential therapeutic modality that can be exploited to suppress tissue and organ inflammation in diverse immune-related diseases involving IL-1-driven inflammation."

We have previously established the delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes within the central nervous system (CNS), based on intracisternal (i.c.) injection of non-replicative HSV-1-derived vectors. Here we show the therapeutic efficacy of i.c. administration of an HSV-1-derived vector carrying the interleukin-1receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene, the physiological antagonist of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1, in C57BL/6 mice affected by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE. IL-1ra gene therapy is effective preventively, delaying EAE onset by almost 1 week (22.4+/-1.4 days post-immunization vs 15.9+/-2.1 days in control mice; P=0.0229 log-rank test), and decreasing disease severity. Amelioration of EAE course was associated with a reduced number of macrophages infiltrating the CNS and in a decreased level of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA in the CNS, suggesting an inhibitory activity of IL-1ra on effector cell recruitment, as antigen-specific peripheral T-cell activation and T-cell recruitment to the CNS is unaffected. Thus, local IL-1ra gene therapy may represent a therapeutic alternative for the inhibition of immune-mediated demyelination of the CNS."

These data suggest that IL-1 is a mediator of the inflammation resulting from active immunization with MBP, and that inhibitors of IL-1 may prove beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system."

                "abstract": "Mechanisms of action as well as cellular targets of glatiramer acetate (GA) in multiple sclerosis (MS) are still not entirely understood. IL-1beta is present in CNS-infiltrating macrophages and microglial cells and is an important mediator of inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), the MS animal model. A natural inhibitor of IL-1beta, the secreted form of IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1Ra) improves EAE disease course. In this study we examined the effects of GA on the IL-1 system. In vivo, GA treatment enhanced sIL-1Ra blood levels in both EAE mice and patients with MS, whereas IL-1beta levels remained undetectable. In vitro, GA per se induced the transcription and production of sIL-1Ra in isolated human monocytes. Furthermore, in T cell contact-activated monocytes, a mechanism relevant to chronic inflammation, GA strongly diminished the expression of IL-1beta and enhanced that of sIL-1Ra. This contrasts with the effect of GA in monocytes activated upon acute inflammatory conditions. Indeed, in LPS-activated monocytes, IL-1beta and sIL-1Ra production were increased in the presence of GA. These results demonstrate that, in chronic inflammatory conditions, GA enhances circulating sIL-1Ra levels and directly affects monocytes by triggering a bias toward a less inflammatory profile, increasing sIL-1Ra while diminishing IL-1beta production. This study sheds light on a mechanism that is likely to participate in the therapeutic effects of GA in MS."

                "abstract": "Neuroinflammation, as defined by activation of local glial cells and production of various inflammatory mediators, is an important feature of many neurological disorders. Expression of pro-inflammatory mediators produced by glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is considered to contribute to the neuropathology observed in those diseases. To diminish the production or action of pro-inflammatory mediators, we have used lentiviral (LV) vector-mediated encoding rat interleukin-10 (rIL-10) or rat interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rIL-1ra) to direct the local, long-term expression of these anti-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS. We have shown that cultured macrophages or astroglia transduced with LV-rIL-10 or LV-rIL-1ra produced far less tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha or IL-6, respectively in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of LV-rIL-10 or LV-rIL-1ra resulted in transduction of glial cells and macrophages and, subsequently reduced TNFalpha, IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in various brain regions induced by inflammatory stimuli, whereas peripheral expression of these mediators remained unaffected. In addition, expression levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and transforming growth factor-beta were not altered in either brain or pituitary gland. Furthermore, i.c.v. administration of LV-rIL-10 or LV-rIL-1ra given during the remission phase of chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, improved the clinical outcome of the relapse phase. Thus, local application of LV vectors expressing anti-inflammatory cytokines could be of therapeutic interest to counteract pro-inflammatory processes in the brain without interfering with the peripheral production of inflammatory mediators."

                "abstract": "IL-1 is an important mediator of inflammation and tissue damage in multiple organs, both in experimental animal models of disease and in human diseases. The IL-1 family consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, two receptors, biologically active IL-1RI and inert IL-1RII, and a specific receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. The balance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra in local tissues plays an important role in the susceptibility to and severity of many diseases. An allelic polymorphism in the IL-1Ra gene has been associated with a variety of human diseases primarily of epithelial and endothelial cell origin. This association may be secondary to an imbalance in the IL-1 system with enhanced production of IL-1beta and reduced production of the major intracellular isoform of IL-1Ra. Treatment of RA with daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant IL-1Ra protein has been shown to be efficacious. Gene therapy approaches with IL-1Ra are being evaluated for the treatment of RA and other human diseases."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine involved in the initiation and amplification of the defence response in infectious and inflammatory diseases. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is an inactive member of the IL-1 family and represents one of the most potent mechanisms for controlling IL-1-dependent inflammation. IL-1ra has proven effective in the therapy of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases in experimental animal models and also in preliminary clinical trials. However, optimisation of therapeutic schedules is still needed. For instance, the use of drug delivery systems targeting specific mucosal sites may be useful to improve topical bioavailability and avoid side effects associated with systemic administration. RESULTS: In order to develop systems for the delivery of IL-1ra to mucosal target sites, a Streptococcus gordonii strain secreting human IL-1ra was constructed. The recombinant IL-1ra produced by S. gordonii was composed of the four amino acid residues RVFP of the fusion partner at the N-terminus, followed by the mature human IL-1ra protein. RFVP/IL-1ra displayed full biological activity in vitro in assays of inhibition of IL-1beta-induced lymphocyte proliferation and was released by recombinant S. gordonii in vivo both at the vaginal and the gastrointestinal mucosa of mice. RFVP/IL-1ra appeared beneficial in the model of ulcerative colitis represented by IL-2-/- mice (knock-out for the interleukin-2 gene), as shown by the body weight increase of IL-2-/- mice locally treated with S. gordonii producing RFVP/IL-1ra. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that recombinant S. gordonii can be successfully used as a delivery system for the selective targeting of mucosal surfaces with therapeutic proteins."

We have previously shown that imbalances in the IL-1 and IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) system cause the development of inflammatory diseases. To explore the role of the IL-1/IL-1Ra system in autoimmune disease, we analyzed myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice bearing targeted disruptions of the IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta (IL-1) or IL-1Ra genes. IL-1alpha/beta double-deficient (IL-1-/-) mice exhibited significant resistance to EAE induction with a significant reduction in disease severity, while IL-1alpha-/- or IL-1beta-/- mice developed EAE in a manner similar to wild-type mice. IL-1Ra-/- mice also developed MOG-induced EAE normally with pertussis toxin (PTx) administration. In contrast to wild-type mice, however, these mice were highly susceptible to EAE induction in the absence of PTx administration. We found that both IFN-gamma and IL-17 production and proliferation were reduced in IL-1-/- T cells upon stimulation with MOG, while IFN-gamma, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production and proliferation were enhanced in IL-1Ra-/- T cells. These observations suggest that the IL-1/IL-1Ra system is crucial for auto-antigen-specific T cell induction and contributes to the development of EAE."

                "title": "Protection against cartilage and bone destruction by systemic interleukin-4 treatment in established murine type II collagen-induced arthritis.",
                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased production of a range of cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1, which display potent proinflammatory actions that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Although TNF-alpha seems to be the major cytokine in the inflammatory process, IL-1 is the key mediator with regard to cartilage and bone destruction. Apart from direct blockage of IL-1/TNF, regulation can be exerted at the level of modulatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-10. IL-4 is a pleiotropic T-cell derived cytokine that can exert either suppressive or stimulatory effects on different cell types, and was originally identified as a B-cell growth factor and regulator of humoral immune pathways. IL-4 is produced by activated CD4+T cells and it promotes the maturation of TH2 cells. IL-4 stimulates proliferation, differentiation and activation of several cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. IL-4 is also known to be a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 by macrophages and monocytes. Moreover, IL-4 stimulates the synthesis of several cytokine inhibitors such as interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), soluble IL-1-receptor type II and TNF receptors IL-4 suppresses metalloproteinase production and stimulates tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 production in human mononuclear phagocytes and cartilage explants, indicating a protective effect of IL-4 towards extracellular matrix degradation. Furthermore, IL-4 inhibits both osteoclast activity and survival, and thereby blocks bone resorption in vitro. Of great importance is that IL-4 could not be detected in synovial fluid or in tissues. This absence of IL-4 in the joint probably contributes to the disturbance in the Th1/Th2 balance in chronic RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used model of arthritis that displays several features of human RA. Recently it was demonstrated that the onset of CIA is under stringent control of IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that exposure to IL-4 during the immunization stage reduced onset and severity of CIA. However, after cessation of IL-4 treatment disease expression increased to control values. AIMS: Because it was reported that IL-4 suppresses several proinflammatory cytokines and matrix degrading enzymes and upregulates inhibitors of both cytokines and catabolic enzymes, we investigated the tissue protective effect of systemic IL-4 treatment using established murine CIA as a model. Potential synergy of low dosages of anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids and IL-4 was also evaluated. METHODS: DBA-1J/Bom mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen and boosted at day 21. Mice with established CIA were selected at day 28 after immunization and treated for days with IL-4, prednisolone, or combinations of prednisolone and IL-4. Arthritis score was monitored visually. Joint pathology was evaluated by histology, radiology and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). In addition, serum levels of IL-1Ra and anticollagen antibodies were determined. RESULTS: Treatment of established CIA with IL-4 (1microgram/day) resulted in suppression of disease activity as depicted in Figure 1. Of great interest is that, although 1 microgram/day IL-4 had only a moderate effect on the inflammatory component of the disease activity, it strongly reduced cartilage pathology, as determined by histological examination (Fig. 1). Moreover, serum COMP levels were significantly reduced, confirming decreased cartilage involvement. In addition, both histological and radiological analysis showed that bone destruction was prevented (Fig. 1). Systemic IL-4 administration increased serum IL-1Ra levels and reduced anticollagen type II antibody levels. Treatment with low-dose IL-4 (0.1 microgram/day) was ineffective in suppressing disease score, serum COMP or joint destruction. Synergistic suppression of both arthritis severity and COMP levels was noted when low-dose IL-4 was combined with prednisolone (0.05 mg/kg/day), however, which in itself was not effective. DISCUSSION: In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic IL-4 treatment ameliorates disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression was only arrested and not reversed, clear protection against cartilage and bone destruction was noted. This is in accord with findings in both human RA and animal models of RA that show that inflammation and tissue destruction sometimes are uncoupled processes. Of great importance is that, although inflammation was still present, strong reduction in serum COMP was found after exposure to IL-4. This indicated that serum COMP levels reflected cartilage damage, although a limited contribution of the inflamed synovium cannot be excluded. Increased serum IL-1Ra level (twofold) was found after systemic treatment with IL-4, but it is not likely that this could explain the suppression of CIA. We and others have reported that high dosages of IL-1Ra are needed for marked suppression of CIA. As reported previously, lower dosages of IL-4 did not reduce clinical disease severity of established CIA. Of importance is that combined treatment of low dosages of IL-4 and IL-10 appeared to have more potent anti-inflammatory effects, and markedly protected against cartilage destruction. Improved anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with IL-4/prednisolone treatment. In addition, synergistic effects were found for the reduction of cartilage and bone destruction. This indicates that systemic IL-4/prednisolone treatment may provide a cartilage and bone protective therapy for human RA."

                "abstract": "We have been developing both local and systemic gene therapy approaches to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. To determine if systemic, constitutive expression of biologically active anti-inflammatory agents is therapeutic and/or has associated toxicity, mouse hematopoietic stem cells were infected with retroviral vectors carrying the genes for human IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), human soluble TNF receptor p75 (sTNFR), or the beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene, and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. The serum levels of human IL-1Ra and human sTNFR in the long-term reconstituted mice, 2-7 months after transplantation, were 596 and 158 ng/ml respectively. The long-term expression of human IL-1Ra had minimal effects on the PBMC profile whereas human sTNFR expression increased the percentage of B220 and Mac.1 stained cells and decreased slightly the specific T cell subsets. The ability of these proteins to protect the transplanted mice from endotoxin treatment was determined by measuring serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) responses after LPS injection at 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 24 h after treatment. The IL-1Ra group showed diminished IL-10 levels and less mortality after injection of LPS. These results demonstrate that constitutive, systemic expression of IL-1Ra and sTNFR is able to confer partial protective effects following treatment with endotoxin. These results further demonstrate that gene transfer methods which result in systemic, long-term expression of immunodulatory proteins could be applied to the treatment of inflammatory diseases."

This model has previously been shown to be IL-1 mediated and a reduction in disease severity is observed with exogenous IL-1ra treatment. Colonic IL-1ra was found to be elevated subsequent to IL-1, and exceeded IL-1 levels 10-fold. Peak levels of IL-1ra preceded both the resolution of colitis and a significant decrease in IL-1 production. Administration of specific neutralizing antibodies against rabbit IL-1ra increased mortality and prolonged intestinal inflammatory responses. A significant increase in IL-1 alpha colonic tissue levels was also measured as a result of exogenous anti-IL-1ra treatment. These studies are the first demonstration that endogenous IL-1ra may play an important role in regulating the host's inflammatory response by counteracting the deleterious and possibly lethal effects of IL-1 produced during acute inflammation."

Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a natural inhibitor of the biologic actions of IL-1, which is known to promote inflammation and degeneration of the joint. In this study, we investigated whether human IL-1Ra gene transfer is effective at treating an established experimental arthritis model. A recombinant adenovirus carrying the gene that encode human hIL-1Ra and GFP (Ad.hIL-1Ra/GFP) was administered by intra-articular injection into the ankle joints of the mice with established the IL-1Ra-deficient Balb/cA mice (IL-1Ra(-/-)), which develop spontaneously chronic inflammatory arthropathy. The effects of two injections of Ad.hIL-1Ra/GFP or control virus with no inserted target gene (Ad.GFP) were compared with the effects of PBS injection with respect to the clinical characteristics of arthritis, as determined by articular index scores, histopathological and immunological assays. We further divided the outcomes of Ad.hIL-1Ra/GFP gene therapy in IL-1Ra(-/-) mice according arthritis stage; early stage and chronic stage corresponding to 8 and 15 weeks of age, respectively. Intra-articular injections of Ad.hIL-1Ra/GFP reduced arthritis severity and footpad swelling compared with control groups treated with Ad.GFP or PBS in early stage IL-1Ra(-/-) mice. Moreover, the histopathology of the ankle joints of IL-1Ra(-/-) mice treated with Ad.hIL-1Ra/GFP showed a significant decrease in synovial proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration, and preserved proteoglycan levels in the joints of early stage IL-1Ra(-/-) mice compared with the control mice. Moreover, Ad.hIL-1Ra/GFP treated mice showed reduced levels of inflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) driven IgG2a antibodies to collagen type II but increased levels Th2 driven IgG1 antibody. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of IL-1Ra may be a promising therapeutic option in the early stage of autoimmune arthritis."

With the availability of specific IL-1 targeting therapies, a broadening list of diseases has revealed the pathologic role of IL-1-mediated inflammation. Although IL-1, either IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2, was administered to patients in order to improve bone marrow function or increase host immune responses to cancer, these patients experienced unacceptable toxicity with fever, anorexia, myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, gastrointestinal upset and sleep disturbances; frank hypotension occurred. Thus it was not unexpected that specific pharmacological blockade of IL-1 activity in inflammatory diseases would be beneficial. Monotherapy blocking IL-1 activity in a broad spectrum of inflammatory syndromes results in a rapid and sustained reduction in disease severity. In common conditions such as heart failure and gout arthritis, IL-1 blockade can be effective therapy. Three IL-1blockers have been approved: the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, blocks the IL-1 receptor and therefore reduces the activity of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. A soluble decoy receptor, rilonacept, and a neutralizing monoclonal anti-interleukin-1\u03b2 antibody, canakinumab, are also approved. A monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-1 receptor and a neutralizing anti-IL-1\u03b1 are in clinical trials. By specifically blocking IL-1, we have learned a great deal about the role of this cytokine in inflammation but equally important, reducing IL-1 activity has lifted the burden of disease for many patients.

The retroviral vector, CRIP-MFG-hIL-1ra (MFG-IRAP), carrying the hIL-1ra gene was used to infect mouse bone marrow (BM) which was subsequently injected into lethally irradiated mice. All of the mice survived and greater than 98% of the white blood cells (WBC) of these mice were of donor type from 2-13 months after transplantation. All of the mice had hIL-1ra protein in their sera (40-1200 ng of hIL-1ra/ml) at all assay periods for at least 15 months after transplantation. Bone marrow from seven of seven primary recipients produced at least one secondary recipient with sustained, high serum levels of hIL-1ra, indicating that hematopoietic stem cells had been successfully transduced. Although the hIL-1ra was biologically active when assayed in vitro, the mice appeared to be well and their WBC counts and hematocrit (HCT) were not significantly different from those of lethally-irradiated mice given BM cells infected with the same vector carrying the lacZ gene. There was also no evidence of alterations of white cell subpopulations. These results demonstrate that systemic production of biologically active hIL-1ra can be obtained by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells and that this level of expression and secretion into the serum is compatible with normal BM engraftment, hematopoietic recovery and survival of the lethally irradiated recipient mice. These hIL-1ra-expressing mice represent a model to examine the functions of IL-1 and hIL-1ra and to determine the ability of hIL-1ra to reduce susceptibility to chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis as well as effects of aging such as bone degeneration. The data further suggest that transduction and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells is a potential method for delivery of hIL-1ra and other secreted therapeutic gene products for systemic diseases."

Therefore, blocking of pro-inflammatory cytokines should be an effective way for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. When IL-1 occupies its receptor, various pro-inflammatory events are initiated including the synthesis and releases of chemokines and these chemokines attract neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes that cause tissue inflammation. IL-1Ra is a naturally occurring cytokine and is the inhibitor of IL-1. When IL-1Ra binds to the IL-1 receptor, binding of IL-1 is blocked by IL-1Ra and pro-inflammatory signal from IL-1 receptor is stopped. There are mounting evidences to suggest that anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra reduces the inflammatory effects of IL-1 and preserves cell function in both types of diabetes. Therefore, IL-1Ra maybe a new therapeutic agent for diabetes mellitus types I and II. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewable multipotent stromal cells that have immunomodulatory capacity. Recently, well characterized subpopulations of MSCs which express IL-1Ra have been described. IL-1Ra expressed by these MSCs effectively binds to IL-1 receptor and protects tissues from inflammation-induced injuries. It has been previously shown that bone marrow-derived MSC therapy could be considered for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 1 and complications of diabetes mellitus.

In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, blockade of IL-6 led to strikingly enhanced experimental EBA, while treatment with recombinant IL-6 was protective. This was due to classical IL-6 signalling and independent of IL-6 trans-signalling, as treatment of mice with sgp130Fc had no impact on EBA manifestation. Induction of EBA in mice led to increased IL-1ra levels in skin and serum, while blockade of IL-6 completely inhibited IL-1ra expression induced by autoantibodies to COL7. In line, treatment of mice with EBA with recombinant IL-6 induced IL-1ra concentrations exceeding those of untreated animals with EBA, and IL-1ra (anakinra) administration significantly impaired experimental EBA induction.

                "abstract": "IL-1 induces a significant number of metabolic and hematological changes. In experimental animals, IL-1 treatments cause hypotension due to rapid reduction of systemic blood pressure, reduced vascular resistance, increased heart rate and leukocyte aggregations. IL-1 causes endothelial dysfunction, the triggering factor of which may be of a different nature including pathogen infection. This dysfunction, which includes macrophage intervention and increased protein permeability, can be mediated by several factors including cytokines and arachidonic acid products. These effects are caused by the induction of IL-1 in various pathologies, including those caused by pathogenic viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 which provokes COVID-19. Activation of macrophages by coronavirus-19 leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases and other proteolytic enzymes that can cause thrombi formation and severe respiratory dysfunction. Patients with COVID-19, seriously ill and hospitalized in intensive care, present systemic inflammation, intravascular coagulopathy with high risk of thrombotic complications, and venous thromboembolism, effects mostly mediated by IL-1. In these patients the lungs are the most critical target organ as it can present an increase in the degradation products of fibrin, fibrinogen and D-dimer, with organ lesions and respiratory failure. It is well known that IL-1 induces itself and another very important pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF, which also participates in hemodynamic states, including shock syndrome in COVID-19. Both IL-1 and TNF cause pulmonary edema, thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to hypotension and resistance of systemic blood pressure, IL-1 causes leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The formation of thrombi is the main complication of the circulatory system and functionality of the organ, and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality. IL-1 causes platelet vascular thrombogenicity also on non-endothelial cells by stimulating the formation of thromboxane A2 which is released into the inflamed environment. IL-1 is the most important immune molecule in inducing fever, since it is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid which increases from vascular endothelial organs of the hypothalamus. The pathogenesis of thrombosis, vascular inflammation and angigenesis involves the mediation of the activation of the prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor. In 1986, in an interesting article (Conti P, Reale M, Fiore S, Cancelli A, Angeletti PU, Dinarello CA. In vitro enhanced thromboxane B2 release by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages after treatment with human recombinant interleukin 1. Prostaglandins. 1986 Jul;32(1):111-5), we reported for the first time that IL-1 induces thromboxane B2 (TxB2) releases in activated neutrophils and macrophages. An increase in thromboxane can induce leukocyte aggregation and systemic inflammation, which would account for the dramatic thrombi formation and organ dysfunction. Hence, IL-1 stimulates endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion, and TxB2 production. All these events are supported by the large increase in neutrophils that adhere to the lung and the decrease in lymphocytes. Therefore, ecosanoids such as TxA2 (detected as TxB2) have a powerful action on vascular inflammation and platelet aggregation, mediating the formation of thrombi. The thrombogenesis that occurs in COVID-19 includes platelet and cell aggregation with clotting abnormalities, and anti-clotting inhibitor agents are used in the prevention and therapy of thrombotic diseases. Prevention of or induction of TxA2 avoids thrombi formation induced by IL-1. However, in some serious vascular events where TxA2 increases significantly, it is difficult to inhibit, therefore, it would be much better to prevent its induction and generation by blocking its inductors including IL-1. The inhibition or lack of formation of IL-1 avoids all the above pathological events which can lead to death of the patient. The treatment of innate immune cells producing IL-1 with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) can avoid hemodynamic changes, septic shock and organ inflammation by carrying out a new therapeutic efficacy on COVID-19 induced by SARS-CoV-2."

                "title": "Role of interleukin-1/interleukin-1 receptor antagonist family of cytokines in long-term continuous glucose monitoring in vivo.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glucose-sensor-induced tissue reactions (e.g., inflammation and wound healing) are known to negatively impact sensor function in vivo. The roles of cytokine networks in controlling these tissue reactions (i.e., sensor biofouling) is not understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a key anti-inflammatory antagonist of the proinflammatory interleukin-1 cytokines [i.e. interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and IL-1 beta] in controlling continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). METHODS: To investigate the role of IL-1Ra in long-term CGM in vivo, we compared CGM in transgenic mice that overexpress IL-1Ra [interleukin-1 receptor antagonist overexpresser (IL-1Ra~OE), B6.Cg-Tg(IL1rn)1Dih/J] or are deficient in IL-1Ra [interleukin-1 receptor antagonist knockout (IL-1Ra~KO), B6.129S-IL1rn(tm1Dih)/J] with mice that have normal levels of IL-1Ra (C57BL/6) over a 28-day time period. RESULTS: Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) analysis of CGM results among the mice of varying IL-1Ra levels demonstrated that during the first 21 days, IL-1~KO mice had the greatest tissue inflammation and the poorest sensor performance (i.e., higher MARD values) when compared with normal or IL-1Ra~OE mice. By 28 days post-sensor implantation, the inflammatory reactions had subsided and were replaced by varying degrees of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data support our hypothesis on the importance of the IL-1 family of agonists and antagonists in controlling tissue reactions and sensor function in vivo. These data also suggest that local delivery of IL-1Ra genes or recombinant proteins (anakinra) or other IL-1 antagonists such as antibodies or soluble IL-1 receptors would suppress sensor-induced tissue reactions and likely enhance glucose sensor function by inhibiting inflammation and wound healing at sensor implantation sites."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uveitis, or inflammatory eye disease, is a common extra-articular manifestation of many systemic autoinflammatory diseases involving the joints. Anakinra (recombinant interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra)) is an effective therapy in several arthritic diseases; yet, few studies have investigated the extent to which IL-1 signalling or IL-1Ra influences the onset and/or severity of uveitis. OBJECTIVE: To seek possible links between arthritis and uveitis pathogenesis related to IL-1 signalling. METHODS: The eyes of IL-1Ra-deficient BALB/c mice were monitored histologically and by intravital videomicroscopy to determine if uveitis developed along with the expected spontaneous arthritis in ankles and knees. Expression levels of IL-1R and its negative regulators (IL-1Ra, IL-1RII, IL-1RAcP and single Ig IL-1R-related molecule) in eye and joint tissues were compared. Differences in uveitis induced by intraocular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice lacking IL-1R or IL-1Ra were assessed. RESULTS: Deficiency in IL-1Ra predisposes to spontaneous arthritis, which is exacerbated by previous systemic LPS exposure. The eye, however, does not develop inflammatory disease despite the progressive arthritis or LPS exposure. Organ-specific expression patterns for IL-1Ra and negative regulators of IL-1 activity were observed that appear to predict predisposition to inflammation in each location in IL-1Ra knockout mice. The eye is extremely sensitive to locally administered LPS, and IL-1Ra deficiency markedly exacerbates the resulting uveitis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-1Ra plays an important role in suppressing local responses in eyes injected with LPS and that there is discordance between murine eyes and joints in the extent to which IL-1Ra protects against spontaneous inflammation."

                "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a naturally occurring antagonist of IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 signaling pathways, has been attributed to the immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs, in IL-1Ra-dependent manner, suppressed production of IL-1\u03b2 in dermal macrophages, induced their polarization in anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, attenuated antigen-presenting properties of dendritic cells (DCs), and promoted expansion of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells in the skin, which resulted in enhanced repair of the nonhealing wounds. Reduced activation of inflammasome and suppressed production of IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages were mainly responsible for beneficial effects of MSC-derived IL-1Ra in alleviation of acute lung injury, dry eye syndrome, and corneal injury. Through the production of IL-1Ra, MSCs reduced migration of DCs to the draining lymph nodes and attenuated generation of inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells that resulted in alleviation of fulminant hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. MSCs, in IL-1Ra-dependent manner, reduced liver fibrosis by suppressing production of Type I collagen in hepatic stellate cells. IL-1Ra was, at least partially, responsible for enhanced proliferation of hepatocytes and chondrocytes in MSC-treated animals with partial hepatectomy and osteoarthritis. Despite of these beneficial effects, IL-1Ra-dependent inhibition of IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-signaling significantly increased risk of infections. Therefore, future experimental and clinical studies should delineate potential side effects of MSC-derived IL-1Ra before IL-1Ra-overexpressing MSCs could be used as a potentially new therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases."

However, the mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory property of GAG remain to be elucidated. In the present study we used in vitro PBMC stimulation assays to demonstrate, that GAG inhibits proinflammatory T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 cytokine production in human PBMCs by inducing Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks IL-1 signalling. GAG cannot suppress human T-helper cytokine production in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1Ra. In a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis, GAG induces IL-1Ra in vivo, and the increased susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis in the presence of GAG in wild type mice is not observed in mice deficient for IL-1Ra. Additionally, we demonstrate that the capacity of GAG to induce IL-1Ra could also be used for treatment of inflammatory diseases, as GAG was able to reduce severity of an experimental model of allergic aspergillosis, and in a murine DSS-induced colitis model. In the setting of invasive aspergillosis, GAG has a significant immunomodulatory function by inducing IL-1Ra and notably IL-1Ra knockout mice are completely protected to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This opens new treatment strategies that target IL-1Ra in the setting of acute invasive fungal infection. However, the observation that GAG can also protect mice from allergy and colitis makes GAG or a derivative structure of GAG a potential treatment compound for IL-1 driven inflammatory diseases. "

            "abstract": "Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common disease mainly affecting joints of the hands and wrists. The discovery of autoantibodies in the serum of patients revealed that RA belonged to the autoimmune diseases and laid a theoretical basis for its immunosuppressive therapy. The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases mainly involves abnormal activation and proliferation of effector memory T cells, which is closely related to the elevated expression of Kv1.3, a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel on the effector memory T cell membrane. Drugs blocking the Kv1.3 channel showed a strong protective effect in RA model animals, suggesting that Kv1.3 is a target for the discovery of specific RA immunosuppressive drugs. Methods: In the present study, we synthesized LrB and studied the effects of LrB on collagen- induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. The clinical score, paw volume and joint morphology of CIA model rats were compared. The percentage of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in rat peripheral blood mononuclear and spleen were analyzed with flow cytometry. The concentrations of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 in the serum of CIA rats were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The IL-1b and IL-6 expression in joints and the Kv1.3 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were quantified by qPCR. To further study the mechanisms of immunosuppressive effects of LrB, western blot and immunofluorescence were utilized to study the expression of Kv1.3 and Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 (NFAT1) in two cell models - Jurkat T cell line and extracted PBMCs. Results: LrB effectively reduced the clinical score and relieved joint swelling. LrB could also decrease the percentage of CD4+ T cells, while increase the percentage of CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear and spleen of rats with CIA. The concentrations of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 in the serum of CIA rats were significantly reduced by LrB. The results of qPCR showed that Kv1.3 mRNA in the PBMCs of CIA rats was significantly higher than that of the control and significantly decreased in the LrB treatment groups. In addition, we confirmed in cell models that LrB significantly decreased Kv1.3 protein on the cell membrane and inhibited the activation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 (NFAT1) with immune stimulus. Conclusion: In summary, this study revealed that LrB could block NFAT1 activation and reduce Kv1.3 expression in activated T cells, thus inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes and the release of inflammatory cytokines, thereby effectively weakening the autoimmune responses in CIA rats. The effects of immunosuppression due to LrB revealed its potential medicinal value in the treatment of RA."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory reactions and tissue damage in the joints. Long-term drug use in clinical practice is often accompanied by adverse reactions. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy with few side effects, offering a potential and safe therapeutic alternative for RA through the induction of immune tolerance. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of ECP on RA using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) murine model, as well as to explore its immunomodulatory effects in vivo. Additionally, particular attention was given to the significant role of monocytes during the ECP process. METHODS: A murine model of rheumatoid arthritis was established by administering two injections of bovine type II collagen to DBA/1J mice. ECP, ECP-MD (mononuclear cells were depleted during the ECP), MTX, and PBS treatment were applied to the CIA mice. During the treatment process, clinical scores and body weight changes of CIA mice were closely monitored. After six treatment sessions, micro-CT images of the hind paws from live mice were captured. Ankle joints and paws of the mice were collected and processed for histological evaluation. Spleen samples were collected to measure the Th17/Treg cells ratio, and serum samples were collected to assess cytokine and anti-type II collagen IgG levels. Monocytes and dendritic cells populations before and after ECP in vitro were detected by flow cytometry. RESULT: ECP therapy significantly attenuated the progression of CIA, alleviated the severity of clinical symptoms in CIA mice and effectively suppressed synovial hyperplasia, inflammation, and cartilage damage. There was an expansion in the percentage of CD3\u2009+\u2009CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009FoxP3\u2009+\u2009Tregs and a decrease in CD3\u2009+\u2009CD4\u2009+\u2009IL17A\u2009+\u2009Th17 cells in vivo. Furthermore, ECP reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (53.47\u2009\u00b1\u20097.074\u00a0pg/mL vs 5.142\u2009\u00b1\u20091.779\u00a0pg/mL, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and IL-17A (3.077\u2009\u00b1\u20090.401\u00a0pg/mL vs 0.238\u2009\u00b1\u20090.082\u00a0pg/mlL, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared with PBS. Interestingly, the depletion of monocytes during the ECP process did not lead to any improvement in clinical symptoms or histological scores in CIA mice. Moreover, the imbalance in the Th17/Treg cells ratio became even more pronounced, accompanied by an augmented secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A. In vitro, compared with cells without ECP treatment, the proportion of CD11b\u2009+\u2009cells were significantly reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.01), the proportion of CD11c\u2009+\u2009cells were significantly elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.001) 24\u00a0h after ECP treatment. Additionally, the expression of MHC II (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), CD80 (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and CD86 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) was downregulated in CD11c\u2009+\u2009cells 24\u00a0h after ECP treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that ECP exhibits a therapeutic effect comparable to conventional therapy in CIA mice, and the protective mechanisms of ECP against RA involve Th17/Treg cells ratio, which result in decreased IL-6 and IL-17A. Notably, monocytes derived from CIA mice are an indispensable part to the efficacy of ECP treatment, and the proportion of monocytes decreased and the proportion of tolerogenic dendritic cells increased after ECP treatment in vitro."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the imbalance of T cells, which leads to increased pro-inflammatory and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines. Modulating the balance among T cells is crucial for the treatment of RA. Kirenol is a major diterpenoid components of Herba Siegesbeckiae, which has been applied for arthritic therapy for centuries. Since prior research showed Kirenol exhibited anti-inflammatory effect in rats, in this study we have evaluated the effect and mechanism of bioactive Kirenol in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) on modulation of T cells. After immunization with bovine type II collagen (CII), Wistar rats were orally administered saline (CIA group), 2 mg/kg Kirenol or 2 mg/kg prednisolone daily for 30 days. The severity of arthritis was clinically and histologically assessed. The numbers of CD4\u207aCD25\u207aFoxp3\u207a T regulatory cells (Tregs) and IFN\u03b3\u207aCD4\u207a and IL4\u207aCD4\u207a T cells were determined by flow cytometry, the mRNA expression level of Foxp3 was quantified by RT-PCR, cytokine levels were measured by ELISA and CII-induced cell proliferation was quantified in vitro. Kirenol significantly delayed the occurrence and reduced the disease severity of CIA. Histological analysis confirmed Kirenol suppressed joint inflammation and inhibited cartilage and bone destruction, compared to the CIA group. Kirenol also upregulated the mRNA expression of Foxp3, increased the numbers of CD4\u207aCD25\u207aFoxp3\u207a and IL4\u207aCD4\u207a T cells, and reduced the number of IFN\u03b3\u207aCD4\u207a T cells. Kirenol reduced the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A and IL-6 in synovial fluid and TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 in serum, and increased the serum levels of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21. In addition, Kirenol inhibited the ability of CII to induce splenocyte, PBMC and lymph node cell proliferation in vitro, compared to cells from CIA rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that Kirenol may be a potential immunosuppressant for the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic in\ufb02ammatory synovitis resulting in progressive joint destruction. Persistent synovial inflammation is induced by activation of various in\ufb02ammatory cells. G\u2011protein\u2011coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) is a G\u2011protein\u2011coupled receptor activated by various bile acids, which has been reported to act as a key adaptor in regulating various signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses and a diverse array of physiological processes, including bile acid synthesis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, carcinogenesis, immunity and inflammation. In the present study, TGR5 expression was detected in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and its association with clinical disease activity, histological synovitis severity and radiological joint destruction was analyzed. Subsequently, the role and potential underlying mechanisms of TGR5 in the PBMCs of patients with RA and mice with collagen II\u2011induced arthritis (CIA) were investigated. PBMCs were obtained from 50 patients with RA and 40 healthy controls (HCs). The mRNA and protein expression levels of TGR5 were detected in PBMCs via reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Additionally, the levels of proinflammatory\u00a0cytokines were analyzed by RT\u2011qPCR and enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activation of nuclear factor\u2011\u03baB (NF\u2011\u03baB) and I\u03baB kinase a was determined via western blot analysis. The anti\u2011arthritic and anti\u2011inflammatory effects of LCA on mice with CIA were then investigated. The arthritis score was assessed, and the protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma of mice were detected via ELISA. TGR5 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in the PBMCs of patients with RA compared with in those of the HCs (0.53\u00b10.58 for patients vs. 1.49\u00b10.83 for HCs; P<0.001); similar findings were observed at the protein level. The mRNA expression levels of TGR5 in the PBMCs of patients with RA with a high 28\u2011Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) were significantly decreased compared with in patients with a low DAS28 (0.81\u00b10.65 for low score vs. 0.35\u00b10.46 for high score; P=0.002). Furthermore, TGR5 expression was significantly correlated with the levels of C\u2011reactive protein (r=\u20110.429; P=0.002) and the DAS28 (r=\u20110.383; P=0.006). RT\u2011qPCR and ELISA analyses indicated that lithocholic acid (LCA, 10\u00a0mg/kg/day) attenuated lipopolysaccharide\u2011induced proinflammatory cytokine production via inhibition of NF\u2011\u03baB activity in the PBMCs of patients with RA. In addition, the arthritis score was significantly decreased in LCA\u2011treated CIA mice compared with in non\u2011treated CIA mice. The increased production of tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1, interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2, IL\u20116 and IL\u20118 was significantly reduced in the plasma of LCA\u2011treated CIA mice compared with the control. In conclusion, TGR5 may contribute to the inflammation of PBMCs in patients with RA and mice with CIA."

                "abstract": "IL-37, a new member of the IL-1 cytokine family, is a natural inhibitor of innate immunity associated with autoimmune diseases. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether IL-37 has antiarthritic effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In this study, we analyzed the expression of IL-37 in PBMCs, serum, and lymphocytes from RA patients as well as CD4(+) T cells polarized under Th1/Th2/Th17 conditions. The role of IL-37 was assessed by investigating the effects of recombinant human (rh)IL-37 and an adenovirus encoding human IL-37 (Ad-IL-37) on Th17 cells and Th17-related cytokines in RA patients and CIA mice. We found that active RA patients showed higher IL-37 levels compared with patients with inactive RA and healthy controls. Upregulated IL-37 expression also was found in CD3(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells from RA patients and in Th1/Th17-differentiation conditions. rhIL-37 markedly decreased IL-17 expression and Th17 cell frequency in PBMCs and CD4(+) T cells from RA patients. Furthermore, IL-37 exerted a more suppressive effect on Th17 cell proliferation, whereas it had little or no effect on Th17 cell differentiation. IL-17 and IL-17-driving cytokine production were significantly reduced in synovium and joint cells from CIA mice receiving injections of Ad-IL-37. Our findings indicate that IL-37 plays a potent immunosuppressive role in the pathogenesis of human RA and CIA models via the downregulation of IL-17 and IL-17-triggering cytokine production and the curbing of Th17 cell proliferation.

                "title": "Protection against cartilage and bone destruction by systemic interleukin-4 treatment in established murine type II collagen-induced arthritis.",
                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased production of a range of cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1, which display potent proinflammatory actions that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Although TNF-alpha seems to be the major cytokine in the inflammatory process, IL-1 is the key mediator with regard to cartilage and bone destruction. Apart from direct blockage of IL-1/TNF, regulation can be exerted at the level of modulatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-10. IL-4 is a pleiotropic T-cell derived cytokine that can exert either suppressive or stimulatory effects on different cell types, and was originally identified as a B-cell growth factor and regulator of humoral immune pathways. IL-4 is produced by activated CD4+T cells and it promotes the maturation of TH2 cells. IL-4 stimulates proliferation, differentiation and activation of several cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. IL-4 is also known to be a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 by macrophages and monocytes. Moreover, IL-4 stimulates the synthesis of several cytokine inhibitors such as interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), soluble IL-1-receptor type II and TNF receptors IL-4 suppresses metalloproteinase production and stimulates tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 production in human mononuclear phagocytes and cartilage explants, indicating a protective effect of IL-4 towards extracellular matrix degradation. Furthermore, IL-4 inhibits both osteoclast activity and survival, and thereby blocks bone resorption in vitro. Of great importance is that IL-4 could not be detected in synovial fluid or in tissues. This absence of IL-4 in the joint probably contributes to the disturbance in the Th1/Th2 balance in chronic RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used model of arthritis that displays several features of human RA. Recently it was demonstrated that the onset of CIA is under stringent control of IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that exposure to IL-4 during the immunization stage reduced onset and severity of CIA. However, after cessation of IL-4 treatment disease expression increased to control values. AIMS: Because it was reported that IL-4 suppresses several proinflammatory cytokines and matrix degrading enzymes and upregulates inhibitors of both cytokines and catabolic enzymes, we investigated the tissue protective effect of systemic IL-4 treatment using established murine CIA as a model. Potential synergy of low dosages of anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids and IL-4 was also evaluated. METHODS: DBA-1J/Bom mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen and boosted at day 21. Mice with established CIA were selected at day 28 after immunization and treated for days with IL-4, prednisolone, or combinations of prednisolone and IL-4. Arthritis score was monitored visually. Joint pathology was evaluated by histology, radiology and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). In addition, serum levels of IL-1Ra and anticollagen antibodies were determined. RESULTS: Treatment of established CIA with IL-4 (1microgram/day) resulted in suppression of disease activity as depicted in Figure 1. Of great interest is that, although 1 microgram/day IL-4 had only a moderate effect on the inflammatory component of the disease activity, it strongly reduced cartilage pathology, as determined by histological examination (Fig. 1). Moreover, serum COMP levels were significantly reduced, confirming decreased cartilage involvement. In addition, both histological and radiological analysis showed that bone destruction was prevented (Fig. 1). Systemic IL-4 administration increased serum IL-1Ra levels and reduced anticollagen type II antibody levels. Treatment with low-dose IL-4 (0.1 microgram/day) was ineffective in suppressing disease score, serum COMP or joint destruction. Synergistic suppression of both arthritis severity and COMP levels was noted when low-dose IL-4 was combined with prednisolone (0.05 mg/kg/day), however, which in itself was not effective. DISCUSSION: In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic IL-4 treatment ameliorates disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression was only arrested and not reversed, clear protection against cartilage and bone destruction was noted. This is in accord with findings in both human RA and animal models of RA that show that inflammation and tissue destruction sometimes are uncoupled processes. Of great importance is that, although inflammation was still present, strong reduction in serum COMP was found after exposure to IL-4. This indicated that serum COMP levels reflected cartilage damage, although a limited contribution of the inflamed synovium cannot be excluded. Increased serum IL-1Ra level (twofold) was found after systemic treatment with IL-4, but it is not likely that this could explain the suppression of CIA. We and others have reported that high dosages of IL-1Ra are needed for marked suppression of CIA. As reported previously, lower dosages of IL-4 did not reduce clinical disease severity of established CIA. Of importance is that combined treatment of low dosages of IL-4 and IL-10 appeared to have more potent anti-inflammatory effects, and markedly protected against cartilage destruction. Improved anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with IL-4/prednisolone treatment. In addition, synergistic effects were found for the reduction of cartilage and bone destruction. This indicates that systemic IL-4/prednisolone treatment may provide a cartilage and bone protective therapy for human RA."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease which is lack of effective therapies. Abnormal activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T lymphocytes are closely related to RA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used for RA treatment due to their immunoregulatory effects. However, the specific molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated and the therapeutic effect has been inconsistent. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of human umbilical cord MSCs (hUCMSCs) on T lymphocytes in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats and RA patients to clarify the possible mechanism of hUCMSCs in RA treatment. The effects of hUCMSCs on arthritis index, radiological and synovial pathological changes, T lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis, ROR\u03b3t and Foxp3 expression, Th17 and Treg cell ratios, and IL-17 and TGF-\u03b2 levels were assessed in CIA rats. Further, we verified the effect of hUCMSCs in RA patients, and compared the effect of hUCMSCs with that of hUCMSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). The results showed that hUCMSCs inhibited the proliferation and promoted apoptosis in T lymphocytes, downregulated ROR\u03b3t mRNA and protein expression, decreased Th17 cell ratio, upregulated Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression, and increased Treg cell ratio in the spleen. Furthermore, they downregulated ROR\u03b3t and Foxp3 expression in the joints, and inhibited IL-17 and promoted TGF-\u03b2 expression in the serum, thereby improving arthritis, delaying radiological progression, and inhibiting synovial hyperplasia in CIA rats. In vitro the effects of hUCMSCs and EVs were consistent with those in vivo. Therefore, hUCMSCs may be expected to serve as a new therapy for RA."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by the overproduction of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a specialised Th subset that provides signals to B cells, promoting the secretion of antibodies. Our previous studies showed that the frequency of circulating Tfh cells were markedly increased in RA patients and positively correlated with disease activity and the levels of anti-CCP autoantibody. Adiponectin (AD) is an adipokine secreted mainly by adipocytes. Our previous work has demonstrated that AD is highly expressed in the inflamed synovial joint tissue and correlates closely with progressive bone erosion in RA patients. However, it remains unknown whether AD aggravates the severity of RA via modulating Tfh cells. This study aims to investigate whether AD exerts effect on Tfh cells in RA. METHODS: CD4+ T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy controls (HC), and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) expression on the surface of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+ (Tfh) cells was detected by flow cytometry. Purified HC CD4+ T cells were cultured with different concentration fetal bovine serun (FBS) in the presence or absence of AD. The percentages of Tfh cells were analysed by flow cytometry. RA or osteoarthritis (OA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were stimulated with AD for 72h and then co-cultured with HC CD4+ T cells through cell-to-cell contact or in a transwell system. The percentages of Tfh cells were analysed by flow cytometry and the levels of soluble factors such as interleukin-(IL)-6, IL-21, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 in the supernatants were determined by Human Magnetic Bead Panel or Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then anti-IL-6 antibody and/or anti-IL-21 antibody was added to the co-culture system, and the percentages of Tfh cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The frequency of Tfh cells in the joint tissue of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice was examined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of Tfh cell transcription factors and functional molecules such as B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), B lymphocyte maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1), IL-6, IL-21, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 in the joints of CIA mice were detected by real time PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) expression was detected on the surface of Tfh cells. However, in the present study, we did not find that AD has a direct effect on Tfh cell generation in vitro. Nonetheless, AD-stimulated RA FLSs could promote Tfh cell generation, predominantly via IL-6 production. And this upregulated effect was partially abolished upon neutralising IL-6. Finally, intraarticular injection of AD aggravated synovial inflammation with increased frequency of Tfh cells in the joints of AD-treated CIA mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that AD-stimulated RA FLSs promote Tfh cell generation, which is mainly mediated by the secretion of soluble factor IL-6. This finding reveals a novel mechanism for AD in RA pathogenesis."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anthocyanin is a plant antioxidant. We investigated the therapeutic effects of anthocyanin extracted from black soybean seed coats (AEBS) in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and explored possible mechanisms by which AEBS might exert anti-arthritic effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CIA was induced in DBA/1J mice. Cytokine levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Joints were assessed in terms of arthritis incidence, clinical arthritis scores, and histological features. The extent of oxidative stress in affected joints was determined by measuring the levels of nitrotyrosine and inducible nitric oxide synthase. NF-\u03baB activity was assayed by measuring the ratio of phosphorylated I\u03baB to total I\u03baB via Western blotting. Th17 cells were stained with antibodies against CD4, IL-17, and STAT3. Osteoclast formation was assessed via TRAP staining and measurement of osteoclast-specific mRNA levels. RESULTS: In the CIA model, AEBS decreased the incidence of arthritis, histological inflammation, cartilage scores, and oxidative stress. AEBS reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in affected joints of CIA mice and suppressed NF-\u03baB signaling. AEBS decreased Th17 cell numbers in spleen of CIA mice. Additionally, AEBS repressed differentiation of Th17 cells and expression of Th17-associated genes in vitro, in both splenocytes of na\u00efve DBA/1J mice and human PBMCs. In vitro, the numbers of both human and mouse tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase+ (TRAP) multinucleated cells fell, in a dose-dependent manner, upon addition of AEBS. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-arthritic effects of AEBS were associated with decreases in Th17 cell numbers, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines synthesized by such cells, mediated via suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling. Additionally, AEBS suppressed osteoclastogenesis and reduced oxidative stress levels."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saposhnikovia divaricata (SD), called \"Fangfeng\" in China, is commonly used in clinical compound prescription for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its actions on RA have not been clarified. The present study aims to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of SD chromone extract (SCE), the major bioactive component of SD, on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, and elucidate its underlying mechanisms with regards to its molecular basis of action on human fibroblast-like synoviocytes derived from RA patients (HFLS-RA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CIA model on rats was constructed by injection of bovine type II collagen. Rats were pre-treated with different dosages of SCE from 3 days before till 35 days after model building. The progression of CIA was evaluated by macroscopic scoring, X-ray observation and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of paws. HFLS-RA were pre-treated with different concentrations of SCE prior to stimulation with 10 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1. By radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were quantified respectively. Nuclear factor (NF-\u03baB) p65 expression and DNA-binding activity were tested by immunohistochemisty and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) respectively. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPKs were examined by immunohistochemisty staining and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Histological examination and radiological observation demonstrated that SCE significantly reduced the inflammatory responses in the joints of CIA rats. SCE inhibited the production of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in the joint tissues and sera. The level of PGE2 in sera was also decreased by SCE. Moreover, SCE treatment in vivo was able to reduce protein level of NF-\u03baB, the transcriptional factor closely related to the inflammatory process, in articular synovium and cartilage of CIA rats. In addition, SCE inhibited p-ERK, p-JNK and p-p38 expression, which were considered to be involved in the phosphorylation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors. Further, SCE inhibited NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity and attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs, in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured HFLS-RA. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the anti-arthritic potential of SCE, and provide further evidence of the involvement of the NF-\u03baB and MARKs inhibition in the effects of SCE."

                "abstract": "P75 pan-neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is an important receptor for the role of neurotrophins in survival and death of neurons during development and after nerve injury. Our previous research found that the precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) regulates pain as an inflammatory mediator. The current understanding of the role of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathway in inflammatory arthritis pain and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. We recruited 20 RA patients, 20\u00a0healthy donors (HDs), and 10 osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of proBDNF and p75NTR in synovial membrane were performed and evaluated. We next examined the mRNA and protein expression of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and synovial tissue. ELISA and flow cytometry were assessed between the blood of RA patients and HD. To induce RA, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were induced in mice. We found over-synovitis of RA synovial membrane compared to OA controls in histologic sections. P75NTR and sortilin mRNA, and proBDNF protein level were significantly increased in PBMCs of RA patients compared with the HD. Consistently, ELISA showed that p75NTR, sortilin, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the serum of RA patients were increased compared with HD and p75NTR, sortilin were positively correlated with Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28). In addition, using flow cytometry we showed that the increased levels of proBDNF and p75NTR characterized in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of RA patients were subsequently reversed with methotrexate (MTX) treatment. Furthermore, we found pathological changes, inflammatory pain, upregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathway, and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in spinal cord using a well-established CIA mouse model. We showed intravenous treatment of recombinant p75ECD-Fc that biologically blocked all inflammatory responses and relieved inflammatory pain of animals with CIA. Our findings showed the involvement of proBDNF/p75NTR pathway in the RA inflammatory response and how blocking it with p75ECD-Fc may be a promising therapeutic treatment for RA."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR-5) on endothelial cell function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and vascularization in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). METHODS: Endothelial cell migration and tube formation assays were used to demonstrate the direct role of TLR-5 ligation in angiogenesis. Mice with CIA were treated with the TLR-5 agonist flagellin to document the effect of TLR-5 ligation in RA pathology. Vascularization in CIA was determined by immunohistochemical analysis and determination of cytokine levels in ankle joints. Spleen Th17 cells and joint interleukin-17 (IL-17) were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The development of Th17 cells induced by TLR-5 ligation was validated in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Ligation of TLR-5 to endogenous ligands expressed in RA synovial fluid contributed to endothelial cell infiltration and tube formation. Furthermore, treatment with flagellin after the onset of CIA exacerbated joint inflammation; in contrast, inflammation in control mice remained at a plateau phase. We showed that TLR-5-enhanced disease severity was attributable to Th17 cell differentiation and joint vascularization in CIA. Examination of the underlying mechanism using RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells documented that ligation of TLR-5 in myeloid cells and production of Th17-promoting cytokines were necessary for Th17 cell polarization. Additionally, we demonstrated that blockade of the IL-17 cascade markedly reduced endothelial cell migration activated by flagellin-conditioned medium, suggesting that TLR-5 ligation can mediate RA angiogenesis either directly by attracting endothelial cells or indirectly by fostering Th17 cell development. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate a novel role for TLR-5 in RA angiogenesis; thus, TLR-5 may be a promising new target for RA treatment."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a T-cell-mediated systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by synovium inflammation and articular destruction. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be effective in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. However, there has been thus far no report on umbilical cord (UC)-MSCs in the treatment of RA. Here, potential immunosuppressive effects of human UC-MSCs in RA were evaluated. METHODS: The effects of UC-MSCs on the responses of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and T cells in RA patients were explored. The possible molecular mechanism mediating this immunosuppressive effect of UC-MSCs was explored by addition of inhibitors to indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), Nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The therapeutic effects of systemic infusion of human UC-MSCs on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in a mouse model were explored. RESULTS: In vitro, UC-MSCs were capable of inhibiting proliferation of FLSs from RA patients, via IL-10, IDO and TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, the invasive behavior and IL-6 secretion of FLSs were also significantly suppressed. On the other hand, UC-MSCs induced hyporesponsiveness of T cells mediated by PGE2, TGF-\u03b21 and NO and UC-MSCs could promote the expansion of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells from RA patients. More importantly, systemic infusion of human UC-MSCs reduced the severity of CIA in a mouse model. Consistently, there were reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine (IL-10) in sera of UC-MSCs treated mice. Moreover, such treatment shifted Th1/Th2 type responses and induced Tregs in CIA. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, human UC-MSCs suppressed the various inflammatory effects of FLSs and T cells of RA in vitro, and attenuated the development of CIA in vivo, strongly suggesting that UC-MSCs might be a therapeutic strategy in RA. In addition, the immunosuppressive activitiy of UC-MSCs could be prolonged by the participation of Tregs."

PURPOSE: The effects of the EtOAc fraction of ethanolic extract from the stems of T. sinensis (KJT) on the pro-inflammatory cytokines and MAPK pathway were studied in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. STUDY DESIGN: Anti-arthritic activity of KJT was investigated in CIA model. METHODS: The chemical constituents of KJT were analyzed by LC-MS and HPLC. The CIA model was established with injecting the bovine CII emulsified in Freund's adjuvant in Wistar rats. Several doses of KJT (50.0, 100.0 and 200.0\u00a0mg/kg) were administrated via oral gavage to CIA rats daily for 4 weeks. The anti-arthritic activity of KJT was investigated by clinical arthritis scoring, paw swelling inspection and hyperalgesia measurement, as well as radiological and histological analysis in CIA rats. The impacts of KJT on the activation of MAPK pathway, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17) in ankle joints, serum, and spleen in CIA rats were examined by western blot, immunohistochemical staining, ELISA, and quantitative real-time PCR respectively. Lastly, the effects of KJT on production of the nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the regulation of the phosphorylation of p38 and Erk were detected in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. RESULTS: KJT significantly alleviated the paw swelling, hyperalgesia and arthritic severity, and reduced the synovial tissue proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration in the CIA rats. Moreover, KJT suppressed the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17 in ankle joints, serum, and spleen and reversed the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of p38 and Erk in CIA rats. KJT was also demonstrated to inhibit the production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), and phosphorylation of p38 and Erk in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the mechanisms of KJT performing its anti-arthritis effect may be attributed to inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulating the MAPK signaling pathway."

The aim of this study was to examine whether the RA autoantigen BiP has epitopes for both effector and regulatory immunities. METHODS: The proliferation and cytokine secretion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-DR4-positive RA patients in response to BiP-derived peptides were examined by (3)H-thymidine uptake and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As a mouse therapeutic model, a BiP-derived peptide was administered orally to mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). RESULTS: Among the peptides examined, BiP(336-355) induced the strongest proliferation of PBMCs from RA patients, but not from healthy donors. The proliferation of PBMCs in response to BiP(336-355) showed a correlation with clinical RA activity and serum anti-BiP/citrullinated BiP antibodies. In contrast, BiP(456-475) induced interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion from CD25-positive PBMCs obtained from RA patients and healthy donors without inducing cell proliferation, and it actively suppressed the BiP(336-355)-induced proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by PBMCs. Oral administration of BiP(456-475) to mice with CIA reduced the severity of arthritis and T cell proliferation and increased the secretion of IL-10 from T cells as well as the number of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. CONCLUSION: Effector and regulatory T cells recognized different BiP epitopes. The deviated balance toward BiP-specific effector T cells in RA may be associated with disease activity; therefore, BiP-specific effector or regulatory T cells could be a target of new RA therapies."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential anti\u2011inflammatory effect of OMT, and its modulation on imbalance between regulatory T (Treg) cells and T helper (Th) 17 cells in rats with collagen\u2011induced arthritis (CIA). Sprague\u2011Dawley rats were immunized with type\u00a0II collagen and following a second collagen immunization, the rats were treated with OMT or dexamethasone (DXM) intraperitoneally once a day for 43\u00a0days.

OMT significantly reduced the production of TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u201117A, upregulated FOXP3 and downregulated ROR\u03b3t in rats with CIA. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that OMT exhibited a protective effect on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through the inhibition of inflammation and regulation of Treg/Th17 in the CIA rats, suggesting that OMT may be used as an immune suppressive and cartilage protective medicine in human RA."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xianfang Huoming Yin (XFH) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula, which has the effect of clearing heat and detoxifying toxins, dispersing swellings, activating blood circulation, and relieving pain. It is usually applied to treat various autoimmune diseases, including Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). AIM OF THE STUDY: The migration of T lymphocytes plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of RA. Our previous studies demonstrated that modified Xianfang Huoming Yin (XFHM) could modulate the differentiation of T, B, and NK cells, and contribute to the restoration of immunologic balance. It also could downregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by regulating the activation of NF-\u03ba B and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in the collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. In this study, we want to investigate whether XFHM has therapeutic effects on the inflammatory proliferation of rat fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLSs) by interfering with the migration of T lymphocytes in vitro experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometer system was used to identify the constituents of the XFHM formula. A co-culture system of rat fibroblast-like synovial cells (RSC-364\u00a0cells) and peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) was used as the cell model. IL-1\u03b2 inhibitor (IL-1\u03b2RA) was used as a positive control medicine, and two concentrations (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) of freeze-dried XFHM powder were used as intervention measure. The lymphocyte migration levels were analyzed by the Real-time xCELLigence analysis system after 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h of treatment. The percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells, and the apoptosis rate of FLSs were detected by flow cytometry. The morphology of RSC-364\u00a0cells was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The protein expression of key factors for T cell differentiation and NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway-related proteins in RSC-364\u00a0cells were examined by western-blot analysis. The migration-related cytokines levels of P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in the supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Twenty-one different components in XFHM were identified. The migration CI index of T cells was significantly decreased in treatment with XFHM. XFHM also could significantly downregulate the levels r of CD3+CD4+T cells and CD3+CD8+T cells that migrated to the FLSs layer. Further study found that XFHM suppresses the production of P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Meanwhile, it downregulated the protein levels of T-bet, ROR \u03b3 t, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, TRAF2, and NF-\u03ba B p50, upregulated the expression of GATA-3 and alleviated synovial cells inflammation proliferation, contributing to the FLSs apoptosis. CONCLUSION: XFHM could attenuate the inflammation of synovium by inhibiting T lymphocyte cell migration, regulating differentiation of T cells through modulating the activation of the NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects and potential mechanism of L161982 (a kind of EP4 antagonist) on the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model. METHODS: The CIA mice model were first established by immunizing with Chicken Type II Collagen on DBA/1 mice. The CIA groups were administered once a day for 2\u00a0weeks with either 5\u00a0mg/kg L161982 by intraperitoneal injections (IP), 200\u00a0U celecoxib by intragastrical injections, or 100\u00a0\u03bcl PBS (IP). At the end of the study, total arthritis score and histopathologic examination were assessed to determine CIA severity. The plasma and tissue expressions of IL-17 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) respectively; The number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) determined as a proportion of total CD4+ cells in the lymph nodes and spleen. We also tested the proliferation of isolated Tregs and the ratio of Th17 polarization of Na\u00efve T cells under the treatment of L161982 by BrdU assay and flow cytometry respectively. RESULTS: CIA mice treated with L161982 showed reduced arthritis scores, joint swellings, cracked cartilage surface, and less hyperplasia in the connective tissue of the articular cavity. Plasma and tissue IL-17 and MCP-1 decreased, while the proportion of Treg cells is increased both in the spleen and lymph nodes of CIA mice. Otherwise, L161982 have no direct effect on Tregs proliferation; a decreased tendency of Th17 polarization in vitro were observed in L161982-treated na\u00efve T cells. CONCLUSION: Although less effective than Celecoxib, L161982 also resulted in a reduction of ankle joint inflammation in CIA mice. L161982 reduces the RA severity in CIA mice through inhibition of IL-17 and MCP-1, increasing Treg cells, and reducing inflammation. The mechanism of the reduction of IL-17 in plasma or tissue after administration of L161982 might be potentially derived from the suppression of CD4+ T cells differentiation into Th-17 cells."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Researches have confirmed that the abnormal signals of OX40 and PD-1 lead to the changes of T cell biological behavior, thus participating the immunopathological process of RA. However, the pathogenesis of RA immunopathological process has not been clarified yet. METHODS: 30 DBA/1 mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (6 mice per group): control group, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) group, PD-1-Fc/CIA group, OX40-Fc/CIA group, and PD-1-Fc\u2009+\u2009OX40-Fc/CIA group. The pathological changes in mice joints were observed by H&E staining. The proportion of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, CD28+, and CD19+ cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was detected by flow cytometry. Serum inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-2, IL-4, IL-1\u03b2, INF-\u03b3) and bone metabolism-related genes (CTX-I, TRACP-5b, BALP) were detected by ELISA assay. Western blotting was applied to measure the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-related protein (p-IKK\u03b2, p-I\u03baB\u03b1, p50) expression in synovial tissue of mice joint. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, CIA mice showed significant increases in arthritis score and pathological score. In the CIA group, a marked decrease was identified in the proportion of CD8+ T, CD19+, and CD68+ cells. Additionally, the CIA group was associated with upregulation of secretion of inflammatory factors in serum and expression of bone metabolism-related genes and NF-\u03baB pathway-related proteins. Compared with the CIA group, the same indexes above showed a further aggravation in the PD-1-Fc group while all indexes improved in the OX40-Fc group. Besides, OX40-Fc fusion protein slowed down significantly the further deterioration of CIA mouse pathological process caused by PD-1-Fc fusion protein. CONCLUSION: OX40-Fc fusion protein alleviates PD-1-Fc-aggravated RA by inhibiting inflammatory response. This research provides biological markers with clinical significance for diagnosis and prognosis of RA, as well as offers theoretical and experimental foundation to the new targets for immune intervention."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic autoimmune disease with high morbidity and disability rate. Currently, there is no effective allopathic treatment for RA, and most of the drugs provoke many adverse effects. Simiao Yong'an decoction (SMYAD) is a traditional Chinese prescription for the treatment of sore and gangrene caused by hot poison. With the development of pharmacology and clinical research, SMYAD has remarkable anti-inflammatory properties and has been used for RA treatments for years. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effect of SMYAD and further explore the immunopharmacological mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arthritis was induced in DBA/1 mice by two-time immunizations. Collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) mice were divided into 4 groups: control, model, methotrexate (MTX), and SMYAD group (n\u00a0=\u00a06). The administration groups were given MTX (0.5\u00a0mg/kg/3\u00a0d) and SMYAD (4.5\u00a0g/kg/d) by gavage from day 14. The arthritis index (AI) score was evaluated every 3 days after the second immunization. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Safranin-O fast green staining, Trap staining, and Micro-CT were used to measure the histopathology injuries and bone destruction of joints. Granulocyte changes in the spleen, bone marrow, and period blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in joints were detected by qRT-PCR. SMYAD-containing serum was obtained from SD rats gavaged with SMYAD. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow for the in vitro experiments of transwell cell assay, apoptosis assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. RESULTS: SMYAD significantly relieved arthritis severity in CIA mice. The AI score was significantly decreased in the SMYAD group compared with the model group. Additionally, SMYAD alleviated inflammatory infiltration, cartilage damage, osteoclast formation, and bone damage in the ankle joints. In the flow cytometry assay, SMYAD significantly reduced granulocytes number in the spleen and bone marrow, while increased in peripheral blood. Furthermore, compared with the CIA group, SMYAD suppressed the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and IL-8 in the inflamed joints. In the in vitro studies, 20% SMYAD-containing serum effectively inhibited the migration of neutrophils, promoted neutrophils apoptosis, reduced ROS production and NETs formation. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results demonstrated that SMYAD effectively restrained arthritis in CIA mice by modulating neutrophil activities."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease for which there are currently no effective therapies. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can prevent arthritis through immunomodulatory mechanisms, there are several associated risks. Alternatively, MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) can mimic the effects of MSCs, while reducing the risk of adverse events. However, few studies have examined sEVs in the context of RA. Here, we evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of human umbilical cord MSC (hUCMSC)-derived sEVs on T lymphocytes in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model to elucidate the possible mechanism of sEVs in RA treatment. We then compare these mechanisms to those of MSCs and methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: The arthritis index and synovial pathology were assessed. T lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis, Th17 and Treg proportions, and interleukin (IL)-17, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 expression were detected using flow cytometry. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR\u03b3t) and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which are master transcriptional regulators of Th17 and Treg differentiation, were also assessed using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: sEV treatment ameliorated arthritis and inhibited synovial hyperplasia in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were mediated by inhibiting T lymphocyte proliferation and promoting their apoptosis, while decreasing Th17 cell proportion and increasing that of Treg cells in the spleen, resulting in decreased serum IL-17, and enhanced IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 expression. Transcriptionally, sEVs decreased ROR\u03b3t and increased FOXP3 expression in the spleen, and decreased ROR\u03b3t and FOXP3 expression in the joints. In some aspects sEVs were more effective than MSCs and MTX in treating CIA. CONCLUSIONS: hUCMSC-derived sEVs ameliorate CIA via immunomodulatory T lymphocytes, and might serve as a new therapy for RA."
