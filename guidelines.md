Only the title and the abstract of a PubMed article is currently shown in SMAFIRA, and annotation will be restricted to these. 
The annotation consists of assessing the similarity between the research goals of the two articles, i.e., the reference article and one of the articles from the top 10 list. 
The similarity is defined by a tree-value scale, namely, similar, uncertain, or not similar, as currently available in the SMAFIRA tool.

More details about the assessment of the similarity will be available shortly.
