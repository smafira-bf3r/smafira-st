            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of the L-arginine metabolism on arthritis and inflammation-mediated bone loss. METHODS: L-arginine was applied to three arthritis models (collagen-induced arthritis, serum-induced arthritis and human TNF transgenic mice). Inflammation was assessed clinically and histologically, while bone changes were quantified by \u03bcCT and histomorphometry. In vitro, effects of L-arginine on osteoclast differentiation were analysed by RNA-seq and mass spectrometry (MS). Seahorse, Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by profilIng Translation inHibition and transmission electron microscopy were used for detecting metabolic changes in osteoclasts. Moreover, arginine-associated metabolites were measured in the serum of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and pre-RA patients. RESULTS: L-arginine inhibited arthritis and bone loss in all three models and directly blocked TNF\u03b1-induced murine and human osteoclastogenesis. RNA-seq and MS analyses indicated that L-arginine switched glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in inflammatory osteoclasts leading to increased ATP production, purine metabolism and elevated inosine and hypoxanthine levels. Adenosine deaminase inhibitors blocking inosine and hypoxanthine production abolished the inhibition of L-arginine on osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Altered arginine levels were also found in RA and pre-RA patients. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that L-arginine ameliorates arthritis and bone erosion through metabolic reprogramming and perturbation of purine metabolism in osteoclasts."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hypoxia occurs in tumors, infections, and sites of inflammation, such as in the affected joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It alleviates inflammatory responses and increases bone resorption in inflammatory arthritis by enhancing osteoclastogenesis. The mechanism by which the hypoxia response is linked to osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone resorption is unclear. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the protein lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) metabolically integrates inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in a state of inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: LSD1-specific inhibitors and gene silencing with small interfering RNAs were used to inhibit the expression of LSD1 in human osteoclast precursor cells derived from CD14-positive monocytes, with subsequent assessment by RNA-sequencing analysis. In experimental mouse models of arthritis, inflammatory osteolysis, or osteoporosis, features of accelerated bone loss and inflammatory osteolysis were analyzed. Furthermore, in blood samples from patients with RA, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) were analyzed for association with the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and associations between HIF-1\u03b1 allelic variants and extent of bone erosion were evaluated. RESULTS: In human osteoclast precursor cells, RANKL induced the expression of LSD1 in a mechanistic target of rapamycin-dependent manner. Expression of LSD1 was higher in synovium from RA patients than in synovium from osteoarthritis patients. Inhibition of LSD1 in human osteoclast precursors suppressed osteoclast differentiation. Results of transcriptome analysis identified several LSD1-mediated hypoxia and cell-cycle pathways as key genetic pathways involved in human osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, HIF-1\u03b1 protein, which is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in a normoxic environment, was found to be expressed in RANKL-stimulated osteoclast precursor cells. Induction of LSD1 by RANKL stabilized the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 protein, thereby promoting glycolysis, in conjunction with up-regulation of the transcription factor E2F1. Analyses of cis-eQTL revealed that higher HIF-1\u03b1 expression was associated with increased bone erosion in patients with RA. Inhibition of LSD1 decreased pathologic bone resorption in mice, both in models of accelerated osteoporosis and models of arthritis and inflammatory osteolysis. CONCLUSION: LSD1 metabolically regulates osteoclastogenesis in an energy-demanding inflammatory environment. These findings provide potential new therapeutic strategies targeting osteoclasts in the management of inflammatory arthritis, including in patients with RA."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: SH3BP2 is a signaling adapter protein which regulates immune and skeletal systems. Gain-of-function mutations in SH3BP2 cause cherubism, characterized by jawbone destruction. This study was aimed to examine the role of SH3BP2 in inflammatory bone loss using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. METHODS: CIA was induced in wild-type (Sh3bp2(+/+)) and heterozygous P416R SH3BP2 cherubism mutant knock-in (Sh3bp2(KI/+)) mice, an SH3BP2 gain-of-function model. Severity of the arthritis was determined by assessing the paw swelling and histological analyses of the joints. Micro-CT analysis was used to determine the levels of bone loss. Inflammation and osteoclastogenesis in the joints were evaluated by quantitating the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and osteoclast markers. Furthermore, involvement of the T- and B-cell responses was determined by draining lymph node cell culture and measurement of the serum anti-mouse type II collagen antibody levels, respectively. Finally, roles of the SH3BP2 mutation in macrophage activation and osteoclastogenesis were determined by evaluating the TNF-\u03b1 production levels and osteoclast formation in bone marrow-derived M-CSF-dependent macrophage (BMM) cultures. RESULTS: Sh3bp2(KI/+) mice exhibited more severe inflammation and bone loss, accompanying an increased number of osteoclasts. The mRNA levels for TNF-\u03b1 and osteoclast marker genes were higher in the joints of Sh3bp2(KI/+) mice. Lymph node cell culture showed that lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 production were comparable between Sh3bp2(+/+) and Sh3bp2(KI/+) cells. Serum anti-type II collagen antibody levels were comparable between Sh3bp2(+/+) and Sh3bp2(KI/+) mice. In vitro experiments showed that TNF-\u03b1 production in Sh3bp2(KI/+) BMMs is elevated compared with Sh3bp2(+/+) BMMs and that RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis is enhanced in Sh3bp2(KI/+) BMMs associated with increased NFATc1 nuclear localization. CONCLUSION: Gain-of-function of SH3BP2 augments inflammation and bone loss in the CIA model through increased macrophage activation and osteoclast formation. Therefore, modulation of the SH3BP2 expression may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone destructive diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoporosis and bone metastatic tumors are mainly mediated by over-activated osteoclasts. Asperosaponin VI (AVI), isolated from the rhizome of Dipsacus asper, belongs to triterpenoid saponins. It has multiple physiological activities but its effects on RA, especially on osteoclast differentiation and activation are still unclear. PURPOSE: Explore the protective role of AVI on collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in vivo and RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. METHODS: The effects of AVI on cell viability and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, actin ring formation, bone resorption activity as well as on osteoclast specific gene and protein expression were tested using bone marrow derived monocytes (BMMs). Paws from CIA mice were used for micro-CT, HE and TRAP staining, real-time PCR and western blot. Sera were used for cytokine analysis by ELISA. The signaling pathways were detected using western blot, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: AVI significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity by suppressing the formation of actin ring. It also inhibited the expression of various osteoclatogenesis marker genes and signaling pathways. AVI protected arthritis in vivo by suppressing inflammation and bone loss. CONCLUSION: AVI exerts its anti-osteoclastogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and function. Thus, our studies demonstrate a potential therapeutic role for AVI in preventing or inhibiting RANKL-mediated osteolytic bone diseases."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine formula used empirically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been shown to alleviate bone destruction in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to characterize the effects of Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu granules (GSZGs) on bone destruction in RA and the underlying mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: A CIA arthritis model using DBA/1 mice. The animals were divided into a normal group; CIA model group; low, medium, and high-dose GSZG groups (3, 6, and 9\u00a0g/kg/day); and a methotrexate group (1.14\u00a0mg/kg/w). In vitro, a cytokine induced osteoclastogenesis model was established. METHODS: After 28 days of treatment, the paw volume was measured, bone destruction was examined by micro-CT, and the generation of osteoclasts in bone tissue was evaluated via tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect and underlying mechanism of action of GSZG on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis were investigated in vitro. RESULTS: The in vivo analyses demonstrated that the paw volume and degree of bone erosion of mice in the medium- and high-dose GSZG groups were significantly decreased compared to the CIA model group. In addition, GSZG treatment suppressed the excessive generation of osteoclasts in the bone tissue of CIA mice. In vitro, GSZG inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Specifically, it only inhibited the generation of osteoclast precursors (OCPs); it had no significant effect on the fusion of OCPs or maturation of osteoclasts. Finally, we showed that the inhibitory effect of GSZG on osteoclastogenesis was related to the promotion of PTEN-induced kinase protein 1 (PINK1)/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy of osteoclast precursors, which was verified using a PINK1 knockdown small interfering RNA in OCPs. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that GSZG is a candidate for the treatment of bone destruction in RA and provide a more detailed elucidation of the mechanism of GSZG anti-RA bone erosion, i.e., inhibition of the ROS/NF-\u03baB axis through the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitochondrial autophagic pathway to inhibit osteoclast precursor production, compared to the published literature."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether activation of p38 MAPK is a crucial signaling factor in inflammatory bone destruction mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Mice overexpressing TNF were treated with 2 different inhibitors of p38 MAPK, and the effect of this treatment on joint inflammation and structural damage was assessed. METHODS: Human TNF-transgenic mice received systemic treatment with 2 different p38 MAPK inhibitors (RO4399247 and AVE8677). Treatment was started at the time of symptom onset and lasted for 6 weeks. Mice were assessed for clinical signs of arthritis, bone erosion, and cartilage damage. In addition, the effect of these inhibitors on osteoclast generation in vitro and in vivo was assessed. RESULTS: Both p38 MAPK inhibitors significantly reduced clinical signs of TNF-mediated arthritis. This was attributable to reducing synovial inflammation by 50% without affecting the cellular composition of the infiltrate. Synovial expression of interleukin-1 and RANKL was reduced upon p38 MAPK blockade, and activation of the molecular target MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP-2) was also inhibited. Proteoglycan loss of articular cartilage was reduced by 50%, although p38 MAPK inhibition did not change matrix molecule synthesis by cultivated chondrocytes. Importantly, bone loss was almost completely prevented by p38 MAPK inhibition. The numbers of synovial osteoclasts and precursors were dramatically reduced, and both p38 MAPK inhibitors also inhibited in vitro osteoclastogenesis at micromolar concentrations and blocked activation of MAPKAP-2 as well as differentiation markers in cultured osteoclast precursors. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the major importance of p38 MAPK for TNF-mediated inflammatory bone destruction in arthritis and suggest that inhibition of p38 MAPK might be an important tool for reducing structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role played by natural killer T (NKT) cells in osteoclastogenesis and their effects on inflammatory bone destruction. METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n\u2009=\u200925) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200912) were enrolled in this study. In vitro osteoclastogenesis experiments were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. PBMCs were cultured in vitro with \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1GalCer), and proliferation indices of NKT cells were estimated by flow cytometry. In vivo effects of \u03b1GalCer-stimulated NKT cells on inflammation and bone destruction were determined in mice with collagen-induced arthritis. RESULTS: In vitro osteoclastogenesis was found to be significantly inhibited by \u03b1GalCer in healthy controls but not in RA patients. Proliferative responses of NKT cells and STAT-1 phosphorylation in monocytes in response to \u03b1GalCer were impaired in RA patients. Notably, \u03b1GalCer-stimulated NKT cells inhibited osteoclastogenesis mainly via interferon-\u03b3 production in a cytokine-dependent manner (not by cell-cell contact) and down-regulated osteoclast-associated genes. Mice treated with \u03b1GalCer showed less severe arthritis and reduced bone destruction. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokine expression in arthritic joints was found to be reduced by \u03b1GalCer treatment. CONCLUSION: This study primarily demonstrates that \u03b1GalCer-stimulated NKT cells have a regulatory effect on osteoclastogenesis and a protective effect against inflammatory bone destruction. However, it also shows that these effects of \u03b1GalCer are diminished in RA patients and that this is related to NKT cell dysfunction. These findings provide important information for those searching for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent bone destruction in RA."

                "abstract": "Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) plays an important role in vascular disease, transplantation, and inflammation. In animal models of acute and chronic inflammation, induction of HO-1 has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. Since inflammation is an important trigger of osteoclastogenesis, we hypothesized that HO-1 might influence osteoclastogenesis. We investigated the effects of induction of HO-1 on osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we addressed the role of HO-1 in inflammatory bone loss in humans. When HO-1 was induced by hemin in vitro, a significant dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclastogenesis was observed. Up-regulation of HO-1 was mediated by activation of MAPK and primarily prevented differentiation of osteoclast precursors to osteoclasts, whereas it did not affect mature osteoclasts. Anti-osteoclastogenic properties of hemin were based on a down-regulation of c-fms, RANK, TRAF-6, and c-fos. In addition, induction of HO-1 inhibited TNF-triggered osteoclast differentiation in vitro as well as LPS-driven inflammatory bone loss in vivo. Furthermore, HO-1 induction suppressed osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in a TNF-mediated arthritis. In line, assessment of synovial tissue from rheumatoid arthritis patients revealed that osteoclasts are usually HO-1 negative. Moreover, serum levels of bilirubin, a metabolite of HO-1, were elevated in rheumatoid arthritis patients without bone damage, suggesting HO-1 affects bone loss in humans. In summary, these data indicate that HO-1 negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis, leading to a positive net balance of bone."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone destruction is one of many severe complications that occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and current therapies are unable to cure this manifestation. This study here aims to determine whether GMSC can directly inhibit osteoclast formation and eventually attenuate osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion in an inflammatory milieu. METHOD: GMSC were co-cultured with osteoclast precursors with or without CD39 inhibitor, CD73 inhibitor or adenosine receptors inhibitors pretreatment and osteoclast formation were evaluated in vitro. 2\u00d710^6 GMSC per mouse were transferred to CIA mice and pathology scores, the frequency of osteoclasts, bone erosion in joints were assessed in vivo. FINDING: GMSC but not control cells, markedly suppressed human or mice osteoclastogenesis in vitro. GMSC treatment also resulted in a dramatically decreased level of NF-\u03baB p65/p50 in osteoclasts in vitro. Infusion of GMSC to CIA significantly attenuated the severity of arthritis, pathology scores, frequency of osteoclasts, particularly bone erosion, as well as a decreased expression of RANKL in synovial tissues in vivo. Blockade of CD39/CD73 or adenosine receptors has significantly abrogated the suppressive ability of GMSC in vitro and therapeutic effect of GMSC on bone erosion during CIA in vivo. INTERPRETATION: GMSC inhibit osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo partially via CD39-CD73-adenosine signals. Manipulation of GMSC may have a therapeutic implication on rheumatoid arthritis and other bone erosion related diseases.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is important for immune cell activation and bone metabolism. To date, the contribution of mTOR signaling to joint inflammation and structural bone and cartilage damage is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of inhibiting mTOR as a treatment of inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: Human tumor necrosis factor-transgenic mice in which inflammatory arthritis was developing were treated with 2 different mTOR inhibitors, sirolimus or everolimus. The effects of treatment on clinical disease activity, inflammation, and localized joint and cartilage destruction were studied. In addition, the effects of mTOR inhibition on osteoclast survival and expression of key molecules of osteoclast function were analyzed in vitro. Moreover, synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was assessed for activation of the mTOR pathway. RESULTS: Inhibition of mTOR by sirolimus or everolimus reduced synovial osteoclast formation and protected against local bone erosions and cartilage loss. Clinical signs of arthritis improved after mTOR inhibition, and histologic evaluation showed a decrease in synovitis. In vitro, mTOR inhibition down-regulated the expression of digestive enzymes and led to osteoclast apoptosis. Moreover, mTOR signaling was shown to be active in the synovial membrane of patients with RA, particularly in synovial osteoclasts. CONCLUSION: Signaling through mTOR is an important link between synovitis and structural damage in inflammatory arthritis. Current pharmacologic inhibitors of mTOR could be effective in protecting joints against structural damage."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinases are key mediators of multiple signaling pathways implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously demonstrated that imatinib mesylate--a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, antineoplastic drug that potently inhibits the tyrosine kinases Abl, c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-Fms--ameliorates murine autoimmune arthritis. However, which of the imatinib-targeted kinases is the principal culprit in disease pathogenesis remains unknown. Here we examine the role of c-Fms in autoimmune arthritis. METHODS: We tested the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered imatinib or GW2580, a small molecule that specifically inhibits c-Fms, in three mouse models of RA: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), anti-collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA), and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis (K/BxN). Efficacy was evaluated by visual scoring of arthritis severity, paw thickness measurements, and histological analysis. We assessed the in vivo effects of imatinib and GW2580 on macrophage infiltration of synovial joints in CIA, and their in vitro effects on macrophage and osteoclast differentiation, and on osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Further, we determined the effects of imatinib and GW2580 on the ability of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; the ligand for c-Fms) to prime bone marrow-derived macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) upon subsequent Fc receptor ligation. Finally, we measured M-CSF levels in synovial fluid from patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and levels of total and phosphorylated c-Fms in synovial tissue from patients with RA. RESULTS: GW2580 was as efficacious as imatinib in reducing arthritis severity in CIA, CAIA, and K/BxN models of RA. Specific inhibition of c-Fms abrogated (i) infiltration of macrophages into synovial joints of arthritic mice; (ii) differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and osteoclasts; (iii) osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; and (iv) priming of macrophages to produce TNF upon Fc receptor stimulation, an important trigger of synovitis in RA. Expression and activation of c-Fms in RA synovium were high, and levels of M-CSF were higher in RA synovial fluid than in OA or PsA synovial fluid. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that c-Fms plays a central role in the pathogenesis of RA by mediating the differentiation and priming of monocyte lineage cells. Therapeutic targeting of c-Fms could provide benefit in RA."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Autophagy is a homeostatic process to recycle dispensable and damaged cell organelles. Dysregulation of autophagic pathways has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy during joint destruction in arthritis. METHODS: Autophagy in osteoclasts was analysed in vitro and ex vivo by transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry for Beclin1 and Atg7. Small molecule inhibitors, LysMCre-mediated knockout of Atg7 and lentiviral overexpression of Beclin1 were used to modulate autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Osteoclast differentiation markers were quantified by real-time PCR. The extent of bone and cartilage destruction was analysed in human tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 transgenic (hTNF\u03b1 tg) mice after adoptive transfer with myeloid specific Atg7-deficient bone marrow. RESULTS: Autophagy was activated in osteoclasts of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) showing increased expression of Beclin1 and Atg7. TNF\u03b1 potently induced the expression of autophagy-related genes and activated autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Activation of autophagy by overexpression of Beclin1-induced osteoclastogenesis and enhanced the resorptive capacity of cultured osteoclasts, whereas pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of autophagy prevented osteoclast differentiation. Arthritic hTNF\u03b1 tg mice transplanted with Atg7(fl/fl)\u00d7LysMCre(+) bone marrow cells (BMC) showed reduced numbers of osteoclasts and were protected from TNF\u03b1-induced bone erosion, proteoglycan loss and chondrocyte death. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that autophagy is activated in RA in a TNF\u03b1-dependent manner and regulates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. We thus provide evidence for a central role of autophagy in joint destruction in RA."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bone destruction plays a key role in damaging the joint function of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fengshi Qutong capsule (FSQTC) consisting of 19 traditional Chinese medicines has been used for treating RA in China for many years. Preliminary studies show that FSQTC has analgesic activity and inhibits synovial angiogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), but its role on bone destruction of RA is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the effect of FSQTC on bone destruction of RA and the possible mechanism of osteoclastogenesis in vivo and in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LC-MS system was used to detect the quality control components of FSQTC. The anti-arthritic effect of FSQTC on CIA rats was evaluated by arthritis score, arthritis incidence and histopathology evaluation of inflamed joints. The effect of treatment with FSQTC on bone destruction of joint tissues was determined with X-ray and micro-CT quantification, and on bone resorption marker CTX-I and formation marker osteocalcin in sera were detected by ELISA. Then, osteoclast differentiation and mature were evaluated by TRAP staining, actin ring immunofluorescence and bone resorption assay both in joints and RANKL-induced RAW264.7\u00a0cells. In addition, RANKL, OPG, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in sera were evaluated by ELISA. The molecular mechanisms of the inhibitions were elucidated by analyzing the protein and gene expression of osteoclastic markers CTSK, MMP-9 and \u03b23-Integrin, transcriptional factors c-Fos and NFATc1, as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and P38 in joints and in RANKL-induced RAW264.7\u00a0cells using western blot and/or qPCR. RESULTS: In this study, 12 major quality control components were identified. Our data showed that FSQTC significantly increased bone mineral density, volume fraction, trabecular thickness, and decreased trabecular separation of inflamed joints both at periarticular and extra-articular locations in CIA rats. FSQTC also diminished the level of CTX-I and simultaneously increased osteocalcin in sera of CIA rats. The effects were accompanied by reductions of osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, and expression of osteoclastic markers (CTSK, MMP-9 and \u03b23-Integrin) in joints. Interestingly, FSQTC treatment could reduce the protein level of RANKL, increase the expression of OPG, and decrease the ratio of RANKL to OPG in inflamed joints and sera of CIA rats. In addition, FSQTC inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in bone resorption, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in sera. When RAW264.7\u00a0cells were treated with RANKL, FSQTC inhibited the formation of TRAP\u00a0+\u00a0multinucleated cells, actin ring and the bone-resorbing activity in dose-dependent manners. Furthermore, FSQTC reduced the RANKL-induced expression of osteoclastic genes and proteins and transcriptional factors (c-Fos and NFATc1), as well as phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). CONCLUSION: FSQTC may inhibit bone destruction of RA by its anti-osteoclastogenic activity both in vivo and in vitro."

We investigated the therapeutic effects of the newly developed PLD1 inhibitors A2998, A3000, and A3773 in vitro and in vivo rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model. A3373 reduced the levels of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IgG in murine splenocytes in vitro. A3373 also decreased the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 and the frequencies of Th1, Th17 cells and germinal-center B cells, in splenocytes in vitro. A3373 ameliorated the severity of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and suppressed infiltration of inflammatory cells into the joint tissues of mice with CIA compared with vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, A3373 prevented systemic bone demineralization in mice with CIA and suppressed osteoclast differentiation and the mRNA levels of osteoclastogenesis markers in vitro. These results suggest that A3373 has therapeutic potential for RA."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Targeting joint destruction induced by osteoclasts (OCs) is critical for management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) plays a critical role in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, we examined the effects of ZSTK474, a novel phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)-specific inhibitor, on murine OCs in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The inhibitory effect of ZSTK474 on OC formation was determined and compared with other PI3-K inhibitors by counting tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells after culturing murine bone marrow monocytic OC precursors, and RAW264.7 cells. Activation of Akt and expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 in cultured RAW264.7 cells were examined. The suppressing effect of ZSTK474 on bone resorption was assessed by the pit formation assay. The in vivo effects of ZSTK474 were studied in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in the mouse. Oral daily administration of ZSTK474 was started either when more than half or when all mice developed arthritis. Effects of ZSTK474 were evaluated using the arthritis score and histological score of the hind paws. RESULTS: ZSTK474 inhibited the differentiation of bone marrow OC precursors and RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of ZSTK474 was much stronger than that of LY294002, the most commonly used PI3-K inhibitor. In addition, ZSTK474 suppressed the bone resorbing activity of mature OCs. Moreover, oral daily administration of ZSTK474, even when begun after the development of arthritis, ameliorated CIA in mice without apparent toxicity. Histological examination of the hind paw demonstrated noticeable reduction of inflammation and of cartilage destruction in ZSTK474-treated mice. ZSTK474 also significantly decreased OC formation adjacent to the tarsal bone of the hind paw. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that inhibition of PI3-K with ZSTK474 may potentially suppress synovial inflammation and bone destruction in patients with RA."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The multikinase inhibitor META060 has been shown to inhibit NF-kappaB activation and expression of markers of inflammation. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of META060 on biomarkers associated with bone and cartilage degradation in vitro and its antiinflammatory efficacy in vivo in both acute and chronic inflammation models. METHODS: Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)-dependent beta-catenin phosphorylation was evaluated in RAW 264.7 macrophages to assess kinase inhibition. The inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity was evaluated in RANKL-treated RAW 264.7 cells. The inhibition of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-mediated markers of inflammation was analyzed in human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). Mice with carrageenan-induced acute inflammation and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were used to assess efficacy. RESULTS: META060 inhibited the activity of kinases (spleen tyrosine kinase [Syk], Bruton's tyrosine kinase [Btk], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI 3-kinase], and GSK3) associated with RA and inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation. META060 inhibited osteoclastogenesis, as indicated by decreased transformation of RAW 264.7 cells to osteoclasts and reduced TRAP activity, and inhibited IL-1beta-activated prostaglandin E(2), matrix metalloproteinase 3, IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 in RASFs. In mice with acute inflammation, oral administration of META060 reduced paw swelling similar to the effect of aspirin. In mice with CIA, META060 significantly reduced the arthritis index and decreased bone, joint, and cartilage degradation. Serum IL-6 concentrations in these mice were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that META060 reduces swelling in a model of acute inflammation and inhibits bone and cartilage destruction in a model of chronic inflammation. Its efficacy is associated with the inhibition of multiple protein kinases, including Syk, Btk, PI 3-kinase, and GSK3. These results warrant further clinical testing of META060 for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by T helper 17 (Th17) cell- and osteoclast-induced joint destruction and inflammation. In RA, several cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1, 6,17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) are involved in almost all aspects of articular inflammation and destruction. This study aimed to evaluate the combinatorial effect of TNF and IL-6 inhibitors on the differentiation and activation of Th17\u00a0cells and osteoclasts in the context of RA, and to identify the RA-related mechanisms through IL-6 signaling. Tetrahydropapaverine (THP) showed direct binding to TNF in screening-ELISA, and SPR and TNF-neutralization assays. In a previous study, the therapeutic effect of gp130-targeting LMT-28 was confirmed in RA. Combinatorial treatment with LMT-28 and THP reduced the arthritis index and showed protective effects against bone and cartilage destruction in CIA mice. The secretion levels of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 significantly decreased upon combinatorial treatment with LMT-28 and THP. Further, the LMT-28 and THP combination suppressed the differentiation and activation of Th17\u00a0cells in mouse splenocytes and human PBMCs. In human RA-FLS, the LMT-28 and THP combination inhibited cell proliferation and downregulated IL-6 and/or TNF-mediated signaling relative to that observed upon independent treatment with LMT-28 or THP. Furthermore, the combination of LMT-28 and THP significantly inhibited the differentiation of mouse bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) into osteoclasts. In conclusion, the LMT-28 and THP combination can attenuate RA through the inhibition of Th17 differentiation and osteoclastogenesis, and suppression of IL-6 or TNF-induced signaling pathways. This combinatorial therapy could be used as a new strategy for the treatment of RA."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND Osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits bone resorption and binds with strong affinity to receptor activator of NF \u03baB ligand (RANKL), thereby preventing RANKL from binding to its receptor RANK. Osteoclasts have documented effects on bone erosion of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to examine the role of miR-145-5p in the regulation of RA osteoclast differentiation and bone erosion. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression of microRNA-145-5p in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial tissue was assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). OPG, RANK, and RANKL expression in RAW-264.7 cells was examined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Osteoclast formation was detected by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The effect of miR-145-5p on predicted target mRNAs was examined by luciferase reporter assays. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced by injecting DBA/1 mice with bovine type II collagen (CII), and miR-145-5p agomir was administered by intravenous injection. Morphological changes in the CIA joint were assessed by micro-computed tomography (CT) and histopathology. RESULTS miR-145-5p levels significantly increased in RA PBMC and synovial tissue compared with normal PBMC and osteoarthritis (OA) tissue. After transfection of RAW-264.7 cells with miR-145-5p, RANK and RANKL expression increased significantly, while OPG expression decreased significantly. TRAP staining results showed osteoclast numbers increased. Micro-CT analysis of the arthritic joints showed that the miR-145-5p agomir caused bone erosion in mice, and histopathological analysis revealed that miR-145-5p agomir aggravates cartilage erosion. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that administration of miR-145-5p aggravates joint erosion in CIA mice. This suggests that miR-145-5p is a potential target for the treatment of RA."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bone destruction is a critical pathology involved in the functional disability caused by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Osteoclasts, which are specialized bone-resorbing cells regulated by cytokines such as RANKL, are implicated in bone destruction in RA. The aim of this study was to determine whether interleukin-21 (IL-21), a potent immunomodulatory 4-\u03b1-helical bundle type 1 cytokine, has osteoclastogenic activity in patients with RA and in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). METHODS: The expression of IL-21 in synovial tissue was examined using immunohistochemistry. The concentrations of IL-21 in serum and synovial fluid were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of RANKL and osteoclastogenic markers were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. CD14+ monocytes from patients with RA or mouse bone marrow cells were cocultured with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with RA or CD4+ T cells from mice with CIA in the presence of IL-21 and subsequently stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity to determine osteoclast formation. RESULTS: IL-21 was up-regulated in the synovium, synovial fluid, and serum of patients with RA and in the synovium and serum of mice with CIA. IL-21 induced RANKL expression in mixed joint cells and CD4+ T cells from mice with CIA and in CD4+ T cells and FLS from patients with RA. Moreover, IL-21 enhanced in vitro osteoclastogenesis without the presence of RANKL-providing cells and by inducing RANKL expression in CD4+ T cells and FLS. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IL-21 promotes osteoclastogenesis in RA. We believe that therapeutic strategies targeting IL-21 might be effective for the treatment of patients with RA, especially in preventing bone destruction."

                "abstract": "The risk of osteoporosis is increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy has markedly improved the outcomes of RA patients but does not improve osteoporosis in some reports. This could be a combined result of disease severity and other therapeutic agents, such as glucocorticoids that accelerate osteoporosis progression. We evaluated the effects of anti-TNF therapy on osteoporosis in an animal model of RA and explored the possible mechanisms involved. Six-week-old TNF transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice with early stage erosive arthritis were treated with TNF antibody (Ab) or control immunoglobulin (IgG) weekly for 4\u2009weeks. We found that TNF Ab completely blocked the development of erosive arthritis in TNF-Tg mice, but only slightly increased vertebral bone mass, associated with reduction in parameters of both bone resorption and formation. Similarly, TNF Ab slightly increased trabecular bone mass in tibias of 8-month-old TNF-Tg mice with advanced erosive arthritis. Interestingly, TNF\u03b1 increased osteoblast differentiation from mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) containing large number of macrophages but not from pure mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). TNF\u03b1-polarized macrophages (TPMs) did not express iNos and Arginase 1, typical markers of inflammatory and resident macrophages. Interestingly, TPMs stimulated osteoblast differentiation, unlike resident and inflammatory macrophages polarized by IL-4 and interferon-\u03bb, respectively. RNA-seq analysis indicated that TPMs produced several anabolic factors, including Jagged1 and insulin like 6 (INSL6). Importantly, inhibition of either Jagged1 or INSL6 blocked TNF\u03b1-induced osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, INSL6 Ab significantly decreased the expansion of TNF-induced MPCs in BMSCs, and anti-TNF Ab reduced INSL6 expression by macrophages in vitro and in TNF-Tg mice in vivo. We conclude that TPMs produce INSL6 to stimulate bone formation and anti-TNF Ab blocks not only enhanced bone resorption but also the anabolic effect of TPMs on bone, limiting its effect to increase bone mass in this model of RA. \u00a9 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR)."

                "abstract": "Recently, the traditional Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f (TwHF) of the Celastraceae family has attracted increasing attention for its potential therapeutic application in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is well accepted that TwHF exerts the antirheumatic activity and mainly depends on its potent anti-inflammatory property. To further explore the therapeutic potential of the well-defined TwHF-derived single compound - celastrol in RA, we study the therapeutic efficacy of celastrol on bone erosion in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and delineate its effects on osteoclast differentiation and functions in RANKL-induced osteoclast precursors RAW264.7 cell line. In CIA mice, daily injection of celastrol (beginning on day 28 after arthritis induction) markedly suppressed arthritis, and reduced bone damage in the joints as demonstrated by histology and bone micro-computed tomography (CT). The effects were accompanied by reductions of osteoclast cells in joints, serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5b, and expression of osteoclastic genes (Trap, Ctsk, Ctr, Mmp-9) and transcriptional factors (c-Fos, c-Jun and NFATc1). When RAW264.7 cells were treated with RANKL, celastrol inhibited the formation of TRAP+ multinucleated cells and the bone-resorbing activity in dose-dependent manners. Furthermore, celastrol reduced the RANKL-induced expression of osteoclastic genes and transcriptional factors, as well as phosphorylation of NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). These findings show that celastrol could directly inhibit osteoclast formation and function, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy of celastrol for managing RA, especially in preventing bone destruction.

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease. Broad knowledge about the genetics, epidemiology and clinical management of T1D has been achieved, but understandings about the cell varieties in the bone marrow during T1D remain limited. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to present a profile of the bone marrow cells and reveal the relationship of bone marrow and osteopenia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice. METHODS: The whole bone marrow cells from the femurs and tibias of healthy (group C) and STZ-induced T1D mice (group D) were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Single-cell flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm the proportional changes among bone marrow neutrophils (BM-neutrophils) (Cxcr2+, Ly6g+) and B lymphocytes (Cd19+). X-ray and micro-CT were performed to detect bone mineral density. The correlation between the ratio of BM-neutrophils/B lymphocytes and osteopenia in STZ-induced T1D mice was analyzed by nonparametric Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: The bone marrow cells in groups C and D were divided into 12 clusters, and 249 differentially expressed genes were found. The diversity of CD45+ immune cells between groups C and D were greatly affected: the proportion of BM-neutrophils showed a significant increase while the proportion of B lymphocytes in group D showed a significant decrease. X-ray and micro-CT analyses confirmed that osteopenia occurred in group D mice. In addition, the results of single-cell flow cytometry and correlation analysis showed that the ratio of BM-neutrophils/B lymphocytes negatively correlated with osteopenia in STZ-induced T1D mice. CONCLUSION: A single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed the profile and heterogeneity of bone marrow immune cells in STZ-induced T1D mice for the first time. The ratio of BM-neutrophils/B lymphocytes negatively correlated with osteopenia in STZ-induced T1D mice, which may enhance understanding for treating T1D and preventing T1D-induced osteopenia."

                "abstract": "Alloxan (ALX) and streptozotocin (STZ) are extensively used to induce type 1 diabetes (T1D) in animal models. This study is aimed at evaluating the differences in immune parameters caused by ALX and STZ. T1D was induced either with ALX or with STZ, and the animals were followed for up to 180 days. Both ALX and STZ induced a decrease in the total number of circulating leukocytes and lymphocytes, with an increase in granulocytes when compared to control mice (CT). STZ-treated mice also exhibited an increase in neutrophils and a reduction in the lymphocyte percentage in the bone marrow. In addition, while the STZ-treated group showed a decrease in total CD3+, CD4-CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ T lymphocytes in the thymus and CD19+ B lymphocytes in the pancreas and spleen, the ALX group showed an increase in CD4-CD8+ and CD19+ only in the thymus. Basal levels of splenic interleukin- (IL-) 1\u03b2 and pancreatic IL-6 in the STZ group were decreased. Both diabetic groups showed atrophy of the thymic medulla and degeneration of pancreatic islets of Langerhans composed of inflammatory infiltration and hyperemia with vasodilation. ALX-treated mice showed a decrease in reticuloendothelial cells, enhanced lymphocyte/thymocyte cell death, and increased number of Hassall's corpuscles. Reduced in vitro activation of splenic lymphocytes was found in the STZ-treated group. Furthermore, mice immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) showed a more intense antigen-specific paw edema response in the STZ-treated group, while production of anti-OVA IgG1 antibodies was similar in both groups. Thereby, important changes in immune cell parameters in vivo and in vitro were found at an early stage of T1D in the STZ-treated group, whereas alterations in the ALX-treated group were mostly found in the chronic phase of T1D, including increased mortality rates. These findings suggest that the effects of ALX and STZ influenced, at different times, lymphoid organs and their cell populations."

                "abstract": "Diabetic osteopenia causes an increase in bone fracture and a delay in healing of fractures, and affects the quality of life. However, the mechanisms responsible for the disease have not been clearly identified. Oxidative stress may be a potential candidate for the pathogenesis, since it is increased under diabetic conditions and is known to induce cellular dysfunction in a wide variety of cell types. Although in vitro studies have shown that oxidative stress inhibits osteoblastic differentiation and induces osteoblast insults and apoptosis, the relationship between diabetic osteopenia and oxidative stress remains unclear. To explore these issues, analysis of a mouse model that represents the diabetic osteopenia as seen in patients with diabetes is necessary. However, there are few reports of such a model. Therefore, we focused on the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse, one of the most common animal models of type 1 diabetes. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the following three groups: 1) control group, 2) diabetic group, and 3) insulin-treated diabetic group. After 12 weeks of STZ treatment, the physical properties of the femora, and the static and dynamic parameters of bone histomorphometry of the tibiae from STZ-induced diabetic mice (STZ-mice) were assessed, and oxidative stress in the whole body and bone of the mice was evaluated. Renal function was comparable in all three groups at the end of the experimental period. In addition, no significant difference in serum PTH, Ca, and P was found among the three groups. In contrast, radiological analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in trabecular bone volume, and histomorphometric analyses confirmed that parameters for both bone formation (OV/BV, OS/BS, and BFR/BS) and bone resorption (ES/BS and Oc.S/BS) were also significantly lower in STZ-mice. In addition, urinary excretion of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was elevated in STZ-mice. Further immunohistological studies showed intensified immunostaining of an oxidative stress marker in bone tissue including the osteoblasts of diabetic mice. Here, we demonstrated that STZ-mice exhibit low-turnover osteopenia associated with increased oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. MSCs that have been used in research on T1D are derived from various tissue sources, with bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord (UC) tissues being the most commonly used. However, the influence of tissue origin on the functional properties and therapeutic effects of MSCs in T1D remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs in a mouse model of T1D as well as in patients with T1D. METHODS: In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the development of diabetes was accelerated by streptozotocin injections. Thereafter, diabetic mice were randomized and treated intravenously with UC-MSCs, BM-MSCs or phosphate-buffered saline as a control. Blood glucose and serum insulin were measured longitudinally after transplantation. At 14\u00a0days post-transplantation, pancreatic tissues were collected to assess insulitis and the \u03b2-cell mass. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the composition of T lymphocytes in the spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes of the NOD mice. In our retrospective study of patients with T1D, 28 recipients who received insulin therapy alone or a single transplantation of UC-MSCs or BM-MSCs were enrolled. The glycaemic control and \u03b2-cell function of the patients during the first year of follow-up were compared. RESULTS: In NOD mice, UC-MSC and BM-MSC transplantation showed similar effects on decreasing blood glucose levels and preserving \u03b2 cells. The regulation of islet autoimmunity was examined, and no significant difference between UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs was observed in the attenuation of insulitis, the decrease in T helper 17 cells or the increase in regulatory T cells. In patients with T1D, MSC transplantation markedly lowered haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and reduced insulin doses compared to conventional insulin therapy. However, the therapeutic effects were comparable between UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs, and they also exerted similar effects on the endogenous \u03b2-cell function in the patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs exhibited comparable therapeutic effects on improving glycaemic control and preserving \u03b2-cell function in T1D. Considering their abundance and higher cell yields, UC-MSCs appear to be more promising than BM-MSCs in clinical applications. Trial registration NCT02763423.

This study was aimed to detect the changes of peripheral CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes and NK cells before and after T1D mice were treated with syn-BMT, and to investigate the effects of these cells in T1D and the effects of syn-BMT-inducing immunotolerance. T1D mouse model was established by multiple low dose streptozotocin injection, the syn-BMT was performed on 10 day after the onset of diabetes. The T1D model mice were divided into group of diabetic mice treated with syn-BMT and group of diabetic control mice (DC), 6 normal C57BL/6J mice were regarded as normal control group (NC). On 30 day after syn-BMT, peripheral proportion of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes and NK cells were detected by flow cytometry. These cells of normal control mice (NC), diabetes control mice (DC) and diabetes mice treated by syn-BMT were also detected. Blood glucose level in three groups was assayed during the whole observation period. The results showed that syn-BMT could reduce blood glucose level of T1D mice to near normal (p > 0.05). Hematopoietic reconstitution happened in a month. The proportion of peripheral CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes, NK cells all increased in new-onset diabetic mice (p < 0.01), while the proportion of peripheral CD8(+) T lymphocytes decreased (p < 0.01). On 30 day after T1D mice were treated with syn-BMT, the proportion of peripheral CD4(+) T lymphocytes was significantly lower than that in DC mice (p < 0.01), but still higher than NC (p < 0.05). The proportion of CD8(+) T lymphocytes was higher than that in DC and NC mice (p < 0.01). The ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes and proportion of NK cells were both obviously lower than that in DC and NC mice (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the syn-BMT can reverse hyperglycemia and immune disorder in diabetic mice. On early period of diabetes onset, the proportions of CD4(+) T lymphocytes and NK cells, the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes increase, while proportion of CD8(+) T lymphocytes decreases in peripheral blood which mye be associated with onset of diabetes."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves presentation of islet-specific self-antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) to autoreactive T cells, resulting in the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. We aimed to study the dynamic homing of diabetes-prone DCs to the pancreas and nearby organs with and without induction of pancreatic stress in a T1D susceptible model of repeated streptozotocin (STZ) injection. PROCEDURES: In vitro labeling of activated bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) from NOD (Nonobese diabetes) mice was performed using zonyl perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether nanoparticles (ZPFCE-NPs). Internalization of particles was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Two groups of NOD.SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency) mice with (induced by low dose STZ administration) or without pancreatic stress were compared. Diabetogenic BMDCs loaded with BDC2.5 mimotope were pre-labeled with ZPFCE-NPs and adoptively transferred into mice. Longitudinal in vivo fluorine MRI (19F MRI) was performed 24\u00a0h, 36\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h after transfer of BMDCs. For ex vivo quantification of labeled cells, 19F NMR and flow cytometry were performed on dissected tissues to validate in vivo 19F MRI data. RESULTS: In vitro flow cytometry and confocal microscopy confirmed high uptake of nanoparticles in BMDCs during the process of maturation. Migration/homing of activated and ZPFCE-NP- labeled BMDCs to different organs was monitored and quantified longitudinally, showing highest cell density in pancreas at 48-h time-point. Based on 19F MRI, STZ induced mild inflammation in the pancreatic region, as indicated by high accumulation of ZPFCE-NP-labeled BMDCs in the pancreas when compared to the vehicle group. Pancreatic draining lymph nodes showed elevated homing of labeled BMDCs in the vehicle groups in contrast to the STZ group after 72\u00a0h. The effect of STZ was confirmed by increased blood glucose levels. CONCLUSION: We showed the potential of 19F MRI for the non-invasive visualization and quantification of migrating immune cells in models for pancreatic inflammation after STZ administration. Without any intrinsic background signal, 19F MRI serves as a highly specific imaging tool to study the migration of diabetic-prone BMDCs in T1D models in vivo. This approach could particularly be of interest for the longitudinal assessment of established or novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches in preclinical models."

                "abstract": "Background: The mechanisms of bone fragility in type 1 diabetes (T1D) are not fully understood. Whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists could improve bone quality in T1D context also remains elusive. Aims: We aimed to explore the possible mechanisms of bone loss in T1D and clarify whether liraglutide has effects on bone quality of T1D mice using transcriptomics. Methods: Female streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups and received the following treatments daily for 8\u00a0weeks: saline as controls, insulin, liraglutide, and liraglutide combined with insulin. These groups were also compared with non-STZ-treated normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group. Trunk blood and bone tissues were collected for analysis. Three tibia from each of the NGT, saline-treated, and liraglutide-treated groups were randomly selected for transcriptomics. Results: Compared with NGT mice, saline-treated T1D mice manifested markedly hyperglycemia and weight loss, and micro-CT revealed significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) and deficient microarchitectures in tibias. Eight weeks of treatment with liraglutide alone or combined with insulin rescued the decreased BMD and partly corrected the compromised trabecular microarchitectures. Transcriptomics analysis showed there were 789 differentially expressed genes mainly mapped to osteoclastogenesis and inflammation pathways. The RT-qPCR verified that the gene expression of Trem2, Nfatc1, Trap, and Ctsk were significantly increased in the tibia of T1D compared with those in the NGT group. Liraglutide treatment alone or combined with insulin could effectively suppress osteoclastogenesis by downregulating the gene expression of Trem2, Nfatc1, Ctsk, and Trap. Conclusions: Taken together, increased osteoclastogenesis with upregulated expression of Trem2 played an important role in bone loss of T1D mice. Liraglutide provided protective effects on bone loss in T1D mice by suppressing osteoclastogenesis."

                "abstract": "The adolescent skeleton undergoes accelerated growth determining overall bone density, length, and quality. Diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), most often diagnosed in adolescents, can alter bone processes and promote bone loss. Studies examining type 1 diabetic (T1D) bone pathologies typically utilize adult mice and rely on pharmacologic models such as streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rodents. To test the effect of T1D on adolescent bone growth/density we used a novel juvenile genetic model (Ins2(+/-) mice) that spontaneously develop T1D at approximately 5 weeks of age and compared our findings with STZ-induced T1D mice. Compared to controls, both Ins2(+/-) and STZ-induced T1D mice displayed blood glucose levels greater than 300\u2009mg/dl and reduced body, fat and muscle mass as well as femur trabecular bone density. STZ mice exhibited greater bone loss compared to Ins2(+/-) mice despite having lower blood glucose levels. Cortical bone was affected in STZ but not Ins2(+/-) mice. Osteocalcin serum protein and bone RNA levels decreased in both models. Consistent with studies in adult mice, STZ adolescent mice displayed increased marrow adiposity, however this was not observed in the Ins2(+/-) mice. Reduced femur length, decreased growth plate thickness and decreased collagen II expression in both model simplies impaired cartilage formation. In summary, both pharmacologic and spontaneous adolescent T1D mice demonstrated a bone synthesis and growth defect. STZ appears to cause a more severe phenotype. Thus, the Ins2(+/-) mouse could serve as a useful model to study adolescent T1D bone loss with fewer complications."

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been reported to treat T1D in numerous studies, and has been proved to be effective in treating T1D based on immune ablation and regeneration. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the curative effect of syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (syn-BMT) and to analyze peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotypes of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice after syn-BMT, and further to reveal possible mechanisms of syn-BMT involved in normalization of blood glucose. After multiple injections of low-dose STZ, most male C57BL/6J inbred mice got hyperglycemia, and then underwent syn-BMT. Fasting blood glucose was detected every 10 days after syn-BMT. The hemocytes count was evaluated every 3 days after syn-BMT in mice. Before syn-BMT, and on days 30, 60, and 90 after syn-BMT, we examined proportion of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, CD19(+) B lymphocytes, and NK cells by flow cytometry. Our data showed that hyperglycemia could be reversed and normal blood glucose level could be maintained in the whole observation period after syn-BMT. The peripheral blood elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocyte ratio, CD19(+) B lymphocyte proportion and NK cell proportion in diabetic mice significantly decreased after syn-BMT. This study indicated that syn-BMT could reverse hyperglycemia and revealed immune ablation and immune system regeneration might be a possible mechanism of syn-BMT involved in normalization of blood glucose.

                "abstract": "Osteopenia is a significant problem associated with Diabetes mellitus. Osteopenia may result in an increased delay in healing of bone fractures and subsequently affect the quality of life. We evaluated the immunohistochemical localization of TRAIL and its receptor DR5 in the femoral bone of 10-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats treated with sesame oil (control, group 1), streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetes inducer (group 2), L-NAME, a general inhibitor of NOS activity (group 3), L-arginine (group 4), (arginine acts as a NO substrate) and iNOS immunostaining in group 1 and group 4. Histological and histochemical findings showed decreased growth of metaphyseal cartilage (which was thinner), decreased osteoid surface, and reduced mineral apposition rate in STZ- and L-NAME-treated rats. These findings confirm that bone formation is impaired in diabetic osteopenia. L-arginine supplementation seems to prevent diabetes-induced bone alterations and preserve the calcification process, allowing synthesis of new bone matrix. The immunohistochemical study revealed increased immunostaining of TRAIL and DR5 in osteoblastic cells of the diaphysis (pre-metaphysis) and epiphysis treated with STZ and L-NAME, related to activation of osteoblastic apoptotic death, while the group receiving L-arginine was comparable to the control group and the higher indications of iNOS activity that may reflect its induction by L-arginine administration. The action of L-arginine suggests that increased NO synthesis and availability is potentially useful for effective prevention and treatment of diabetic osteopenia."

                "abstract": "To explore the pathogenesis of diabetes associated osteopenia, we characterized the osteopenia in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats pharmacologically and biochemically. The femur metaphyseal bone mineral density measured by single photon absorptiometry decreased time-dependently in the STZ rats compared with that in control, and the difference reached statistical significance from 2 weeks after treatment with STZ. Closely similar bone loss was obtained in ovariectomized (Ovx) and vitamin D deficient(D(-)) rats. Daily oral treatment with a bone resorption inhibitor, FR78844 (a bisphosphonate compound, 100 mg/kg), for 4 weeks significantly attenuated the osteopenia in the STZ and Ovx rats, but not in the D(-) rats, while 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha-(OH)D3) significantly attenuated the osteopenia in the STZ and D(-) rats in a dose of 0.1 microgram/kg/day, and that in the Ovx rats in 1 microgram/kg/day. The latter dose of 1 alpha-(OH)D3 significantly increased the metaphyseal bone mineral density of the femur in normal rats. Serum levels of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D), the most active metabolite of vitamin D, hardly changed in the Ovx rats compared with that in control, but decreased to 24 and 76% that of control in the STZ and D(-) rats, respectively. Serum PTH levels in the STZ, Ovx and D(-) rats were comparable with those in controls, but serum calcitonin levels were reduced to 60 and 66% of control in the STZ and Ovx rats, respectively. Serum osteocalcin levels also decreased in the STZ rats compared to control. It is thus speculated that the predominance of bone resorption over bone formation and the reduction of 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes associated osteopenia."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The streptozotocin (STZ) model is widely used in diabetes research. However, the cellular and molecular states of pancreatic endocrine cells in this model remain unclear. This study explored the molecular characteristics of islet cells treated with STZ and re-evaluated \u03b2-cell dysfunction and regeneration in the STZ model. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pancreatic endocrine cells from STZ-treated mice. High-quality sequencing data from 2,999 cells were used to identify clusters via Louvain clustering analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), force-directed layout (FDL), and differential expression analysis were used to define the heterogeneity and transcriptomic changes in islet cells. In addition, qPCR and immunofluorescence staining were used to confirm findings from the sequencing data. RESULTS: Untreated \u03b2-cells were divided into two populations at the transcriptomic level, a large high-Glut2 expression (Glut2high) population and a small low-Glut2 expression (Glut2low) population. At the transcriptomic level, Glut2low \u03b2-cells in adult mice did not represent a developmentally immature state, although a fraction of genes associated with \u03b2-cell maturation and function were downregulated in Glut2low cells. After a single high-dose STZ treatment, most Glut2high cells were killed, but Glut2low cells survived and over time changed to a distinct cell state. We did not observe conversion of Glut2low to Glut2high \u03b2-cells up to 9 months after STZ treatment. In addition, we did not detect transcriptomic changes in the non-\u03b2 endocrine cells or a direct trans-differentiation pathway from the \u03b1-cell lineage to the \u03b2-cell lineage in the STZ model. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the heterogeneity of \u03b2-cells in both physiological and pathological conditions. However, we did not observe conversion of Glut2low to Glut2high \u03b2-cells, transcriptomic changes in the non-\u03b2 endocrine cells, or direct trans-differentiation from the \u03b1-cell lineage to the \u03b2-cell lineage in the STZ model. Our results clearly define the states of islet cells treated with STZ and allow us to re-evaluate the STZ model widely used in diabetes studies."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Experimental models showing variable diabetic status are necessary to understand the relationship between diabetes and periodontitis. The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model allows control of diabetic status by nicotinamide (NA), which protects against STZ-induced \u03b2-cell necrosis. Therefore, we compared diabetic characteristics and alveolar bone loss in STZ- and STZ-NA-treated rats with periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: STZ-treated rats were generated by intravenous (IV) administration of STZ (50\u00a0mg/kg). STZ-NA-treated rats were induced by intraperitoneal administration of NA (270\u00a0mg/kg) 15\u00a0min before IV administration of STZ (65\u00a0mg/kg). Periodontitis was induced by ligature around the left mandibular first molar 1\u00a0wk after injection. Blood glucose level, glucose tolerance and serum insulin levels were determined at day 0 and/or 20 after ligature. At day 20, tibia bone loss was assessed using micro-computed tomography and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Alveolar bone loss was histologically measured as the distance of the cementoenamel junction to the alveolar bone crest in distal and the percentage of periodontal ligament area in the first molar furcation, respectively. The number of inflammatory cells, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-positive cells and the area of osteoid were determined. RESULTS: In STZ-treated rats, obvious hyperglycemia over 300\u00a0mg/dL and severe body weight loss were observed. The insulin level was approximately 14% compared to that of control rats. STZ-NA-treated rats were impaired in glucose tolerance compared to control rats; however, body weight and insulin levels were not significantly different. Tibia bone loss was increased in STZ-treated rats, but significant change was not observed in STZ-NA-treated rats compared to control rats. In ligatured teeth, alveolar bone loss was increased in both STZ- and STZ-NA-treated rats compared to control rats. Alveolar bone loss, the number of inflammatory cells and RANKL-positive cells in STZ-treated rats were greater than in STZ-NA-treated rats. The area of osteoid decreased in STZ-treated rats compared to control, but not STZ-NA-treated rats. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that STZ- and STZ-NA-treated rats exhibit diabetic characteristics similar to type 1 diabetes mellitus and a pre-diabetic state, respectively. In addition, alveolar bone loss in response to periodontitis and tibia loss depend on diabetic status. Diabetic status-dependent bone remodeling imbalance and inflammation could affect the alveolar bone loss in the two models. Both STZ- and STZ-NA-treated rats may be useful to investigate differences in periodontitis sensitivity associated with diabetic status and to develop therapeutic agents for periodontitis in patients with diabetes."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Extensive trauma surgery evokes an immediate cellular immune response including altered circulatory neutrophil numbers. The concurrent bone marrow (BM) response however is currently unclear. We hypothesize that these BM changes include (1) a relative reduction of the bone marrow neutrophil fraction and (2) increasing heterogeneity of the bone marrow neutrophil pool due to (3) the appearance of aged/returning neutrophils from circulation into the BM-compartment. Materials and Methods: Eight pigs were included in a standardized extensive trauma surgery model. Blood and bone marrow samples were collected at baseline and after 3 hours of ongoing trauma surgery. Leukocyte and subtype counts and cell surface receptor expression levels were studied by flow cytometry. Results: All animals survived the interventions. A significant drop in circulating neutrophil counts from 9.3 to 3.2x106 cells/ml (P=0.001) occurred after intervention, whereas circulatory neutrophil cell surface expression of CD11b increased. The concurrent bone marrow response included an increase of the BM neutrophil fraction from 63 \u00b1 3 to 71 \u00b1 3 percent (P<0.05). Simultaneously, the BM neutrophil pool became increasingly mature with a relative increase of a CXCR4high-neutrophil subtype that was virtually absent at baseline. Conclusion: The current study shows a shift in composition of the BM neutrophil pool during extensive trauma surgery that was associated with a relatively circulatory neutropenia. More specifically, under these conditions BM neutrophils were more mature than under homeostatic conditions and a CXCR4high-neutrophil subset became overrepresented possibly reflecting remigration of aged neutrophils to the BM. These findings may contribute to the development of novel interventions aimed to modify the trauma-induced immune response in the BM."

                "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is correlated with osteopenia primarily due to low bone formation. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a known anabolic agent for bone, the anabolic effects of which are partially mediated through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. In the present study, we first determined the utility of intermittent PTH treatment in a streptozotocin-induced T1D mouse model. It was shown that the PTH-induced anabolic effects on bone mass and bone formation were attenuated in T1D mice compared with nondiabetic mice. Further, PTH treatment failed to activate \u03b2-catenin signaling in osteoblasts of T1D mice and was unable to improve osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Next, the Col1-3.2\u2009kb-CreERTM; \u03b2-cateninfx(ex3) mice were used to conditionally activate \u03b2-catenin in osteoblasts by injecting tamoxifen, and we addressed whether or not preactivation of \u03b2-catenin boosted the anabolic action of PTH on T1D-related bone loss. The results demonstrated that pretreatment with activation of osteoblastic \u03b2-catenin followed by PTH treatment outperformed PTH or \u03b2-catenin activation monotherapy and led to greatly improved bone structure, bone mass, and bone strength in this preclinical model of T1DM. Further analysis demonstrated that osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, as well as osteoprogenitors in the marrow, were all improved in the combination treatment group. These findings indicated a clear advantage of developing \u03b2-catenin as a target to improve the efficacy of PTH in the treatment of T1D-related osteopenia."

METHODS: The IDDM model was established by a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) in Balb/c mice. Two DC subpopulations were generated from the BM cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with or without interleukin-4. The purity and the T cell stimulatory capability of DC were identified. These cells were used to modulate autoimmune response in pre-diabetic mice. Blood glucose was examined weekly; pancreas tissues were taken for histopathological analysis, and CD4(+) T cells were isolated to detect lymphocyte proliferation by MTT assay and the ratio of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA analysis. RESULTS: Two DC subsets were generated from BM, which have phenotypes of mature DC (mDC) and immature DC (iDC), respectively. The level of blood glucose decreased significantly by transferring iDC (P< 0.01) rather than mDC. Less lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the islets, and pancreatic structure was intact. In vitro, proliferation of lymphocytes decreased and the proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells increased remarkably, compared with the mDC-treated groups (P< 0.05), which were associated with increased level of the Th2 cytokine and reduced level of the Th1 cytokine after iDC transfer. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that iDC transfer was able to confer protection to mice from STZ-induced IDDM. The immune-tolerance to IDDM may be associated with promoting the production of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells and inducing regulatory Th2 responses in vivo."

This study assessed the impact of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type-1-diabetes (T1D) on intestinal microbiota composition and diversity in Sprague-Dawley rats, compared with healthy controls over time. T1D was induced by injection of a single dose (60 mg STZ kg(-1)) of STZ, administered via the intraperitoneal cavity. Total DNA was isolated from faecal pellets at weeks 0 (pre-STZ injection), 1, 2 and 4 and from caecal content at week 5 from both healthy and T1D groups. High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to investigate intestinal microbiota composition. The data revealed that although intestinal microbiota composition between the groups was similar at week 0, a dramatic impact of T1D development on the microbiota was apparent post-STZ injection and for up to 5 weeks. Most notably, T1D onset was associated with a shift in the Bacteroidetes\u200a:\u200aFirmicutes ratio (P<0.05), while at the genus level, increased proportions of lactic acid producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were associated with the later stages of T1D progression (P<0.05). Coincidently, T1D increased caecal lactate levels (P<0.05). Microbial diversity was also reduced following T1D (P<0.05). Principle co-ordinate analyses demonstrated temporal clustering in T1D and control groups with distinct separation between groups. The results provide a comprehensive account of how T1D is associated with an altered intestinal microbiota composition and reduced microbial diversity over time. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune responses resulting in destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exhibit immunomodulatory potential, migratory capacity to injured areas and may contribute to tissue regeneration by the secretion of bioactive factors. Therefore, MSCs are considered as a promising approach to treat patients with different autoimmune diseases (AID), including T1D patients. Phenotypical and functional alterations have been reported in MSCs derived from patients with different AID. However, little is known about the properties of MSCs derived from patients with T1D. Since autoimmunity and the diabetic microenvironment may affect the biology of MSCs, it becomes important to investigate whether these cells are suitable for autologous transplantation. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro properties and the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of MSCs isolated from bone marrow of newly diagnosed T1D patients (T1D-MSCs) and to compare them with MSCs from healthy individuals (C-MSCs). METHODS: T1D-MSCs and C-MSCs were isolated and cultured until third passage. Then, morphology, cell diameter, expression of surface markers, differentiation potential, global microarray analyses and immunosuppressive capacity were in vitro analyzed. T1D-MSCs and C-MSCs therapeutic potential were evaluated using a murine experimental model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. RESULTS: T1D-MSCs and C-MSCs presented similar morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation potential, gene expression of immunomodulatory molecules and in vitro immunosuppressive capacity. When administered into diabetic mice, both T1D-MSCs and C-MSCs were able to reverse hyperglycemia, improve beta cell function and modulate pancreatic cytokine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, bone marrow MSCs isolated from T1D patients recently after diagnosis are not phenotypically or functionally impaired by harmful inflammatory and metabolic diabetic conditions. Our results provide support for the use of autologous MSCs for treatment of newly diagnosed T1D patients."

T1D induces oxidative stress in various tissues and organs. Vitamin C plays an important role in the attenuation of oxidative stress; however, little is known about the effect of T1D induced oxidative stress on the regulation of vitamin C transporter in bone and bone marrow cells. To investigate this, T1D was induced in mice by multiple low dose injections of streptozotocin. We have demonstrated that endogenous antioxidants, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are down-regulated in the bone and bone marrow of T1D. The vitamin C transporter isoform SVCT2, the only known transporter expressed in bone and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), is negatively regulated in the bone and bone marrow of T1D. The \u03bcCT imaging of the bone showed significantly lower bone quality in the 8 week T1D mouse. The in-vitro study in BMSCS showed that the knockdown of SVCT2 transporter decreases ascorbic acid (AA) uptake, and increases oxidative stress. The significant reversing effect of antioxidant vitamin C is only possible in control cells, not in knockdown cells. This study suggested that T1D induces oxidative stress and decreases SVCT2 expression in the bone and bone marrow environment. Furthermore, this study confirms that T1D increases bone resorption, decreases bone formation and changes the microstructure of bones. This study has provided evidence that the regulation of the SVCT2 transporter plays an important role not only in T1D osteoporosis but also in other oxidative stress-related musculoskeletal complications."

                "abstract": "AIM: This study set forth a question: are there any differences in bone responses to insulin and/or vitamin D3 treatment in female and male type 1 diabetic (T1D) mice? MAIN METHODS: To address this issue, a non-critical sized femur defect was created in streptozotocin (STZ)-T1D mice. Control non-diabetic and T1D female and male mice received: saline; vitamin D3; insulin; or vitamin D3 plus insulin, for 21\u00a0days. KEY FINDINGS: Female and male T1D mice showed impaired bone healing, as indicated by histological and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. Vitamin D3 or insulin improved the bone regeneration in T1D mice, irrespective of sex. Vitamin D3 plus insulin did not exhibit any additional effects. There were no differences regarding the numbers of TRAP-stained osteoclasts in either evaluated groups. The osteoblast-related gene osterix was upregulated in vitamin D3-treated male T1D mice, as revealed by RT-qPCR. Female T1D mice treated with vitamin D3, insulin, or vitamin D3 plus insulin presented an increased expression of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA. Conversely, IGF-1 mRNA levels were reduced by the same treatments in male TD1 mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, the results suggested that T1D similarly delayed the osseous healing in female and male mice, with beneficial effects for either vitamin D3 or insulin in T1D mice of both sexes. However, data indicated marked sex differences regarding the expression of genes implicated in bone formation, in T1D mice treated with vitamin D3 and/or insulin."

                "abstract": "A deficit in bone formation is a major factor in diabetes-related osteopenia. We examined here whether diabetes-associated changes in osteoblast phenotype might in part result from a decrease in PTH-related protein (PTHrP). We used a bone marrow ablation model in diabetic mice by multiple streptozotocin injections. PTHrP (1-36) (100 microg/kg, every other day) or vehicle was administered to mice for 13 d starting 1 wk before marrow ablation. Diabetic mice showed bone loss in both the intact femur and the regenerating tibia on d 6 after ablation; in the latter, this was related to decreased bone-forming cells, osteoid surface, and blood vessels, and increased marrow adiposity. Moreover, a decrease in matrix mineralization occurred in ex vivo bone marrow cultures from the unablated tibia from diabetic mice. These skeletal alterations were associated with decreased gene expression (by real-time PCR) of Runx2, osterix, osteocalcin, PTHrP, the PTH type 1 receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors, and osteoprotegerin to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand mRNA ratio, and increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 mRNA levels. Similar changes were induced by hyperosmotic (high glucose or mannitol) medium in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, which were mimicked by adding a neutralizing anti-PTHrP antibody or PTH type 1 receptor antagonists to these cells in normal glucose medium. PTHrP (1-36) administration reversed these changes in both intact and regenerating bones from diabetic mice in vivo, and in MC3T3-E1 cells exposed to high glucose. These findings strongly suggest that PTHrP has an important role in the altered osteoblastic function related to diabetes."

            "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Thousands of years of clinical practice in the treatment of joint-related diseases support the efficacy and safety of Wutou decoction (WTD). Nevertheless, the lack of pharmacological evidence and unclear mechanisms make it difficult for WTD to become a recognized complementary therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effect of WTD against synovial inflammation in RA and whether this effect depends on the regulation of macrophage polarization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. WTD with low and high doses was administered for 45 days. RAW264.7\u00a0cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin (IL)-4 to polarize M1 and M2 macrophages, which were pre-treated with WTD extract for 4\u00a0h. The anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory effects of WTD were studied using arthritis score, histopathological staining, immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The polarization state of RAW264.7\u00a0cells and related pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines was detected by ELISA, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the effect of WTD on nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) activation both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: WTD significantly reduced the arthritis score and the pathological damage of the knee joint and decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6 in serum, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in the knee synovium. WTD inhibited M1 type polarization and promoted M2 type polarization, both in vitro and in vivo, and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Experiments showed that WTD inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB and downstream p38 in the synovium of CIA rats and LPS-induced M1 type polarized RAW264.7\u00a0cells. In addition, PPAR\u03b3 expression in the synovium of CIA rats was mainly located in the cytoplasm, and WTD treatment increased the nuclear translocation of PPAR\u03b3, which was further verified in RAW264.7\u00a0cells. CONCLUSIONS: NF-\u03baB and PPAR\u03b3 regulating M1 and M2 macrophage polarization and subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are the underlying mechanisms of WTD that ameliorate RA synovial inflammation."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saposhnikovia divaricata (SD), called \"Fangfeng\" in China, is commonly used in clinical compound prescription for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its actions on RA have not been clarified. The present study aims to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of SD chromone extract (SCE), the major bioactive component of SD, on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, and elucidate its underlying mechanisms with regards to its molecular basis of action on human fibroblast-like synoviocytes derived from RA patients (HFLS-RA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CIA model on rats was constructed by injection of bovine type II collagen. Rats were pre-treated with different dosages of SCE from 3 days before till 35 days after model building. The progression of CIA was evaluated by macroscopic scoring, X-ray observation and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of paws. HFLS-RA were pre-treated with different concentrations of SCE prior to stimulation with 10 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1. By radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were quantified respectively. Nuclear factor (NF-\u03baB) p65 expression and DNA-binding activity were tested by immunohistochemisty and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) respectively. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPKs were examined by immunohistochemisty staining and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Histological examination and radiological observation demonstrated that SCE significantly reduced the inflammatory responses in the joints of CIA rats. SCE inhibited the production of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in the joint tissues and sera. The level of PGE2 in sera was also decreased by SCE. Moreover, SCE treatment in vivo was able to reduce protein level of NF-\u03baB, the transcriptional factor closely related to the inflammatory process, in articular synovium and cartilage of CIA rats. In addition, SCE inhibited p-ERK, p-JNK and p-p38 expression, which were considered to be involved in the phosphorylation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors. Further, SCE inhibited NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity and attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs, in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured HFLS-RA. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the anti-arthritic potential of SCE, and provide further evidence of the involvement of the NF-\u03baB and MARKs inhibition in the effects of SCE."

                "abstract": "Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder, characterized by an increased number of M1-like macrophages in the joints. Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the main components in the Rhizoma of Paris polyphyllin, displays a selective inhibitory effect on various tumor cells. Here we sought to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects and mechanisms of PPI on macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Materials and Methods:In vitro, primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and peritoneal elucidated macrophages (PEMs) were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and then treated with PPI. We determined the degree of activation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and p65, two key mediators of the NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory pathway, by measuring their phosphorylated forms by Western blot. The p65 nuclear localization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Further, a NF-\u03baB-linked luciferase reporter plasmid, as well as those expressing key mediators of the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway, such as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) associated kinase (IRAK)-1, TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF)-6, Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p65, were used to identify the mechanism by which PPI achieves its inhibitory effects on macrophage-mediated inflammation. Moreover, a NF-\u03baB inhibitor, p65-targeted siRNAs, and a p65 plasmid were further used to validate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPI. In vivo, PPI (1 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically one time a day for 7 weeks starting on the 42nd day after the first immunization with collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Micro-computed Tomography scanning, histological examination, F4/80 and iNOS double immunofluorescent staining and CD4 immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine the effect of PPI treatment on joint structure and inflammation in this model. Results: PPI reduced the inflammatory cytokines production of PEMs stimulated by LPS/IFN-\u03b3, inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and p65, and prevented p65 nuclear localization. The NF-\u03baB luciferase assay showed that the target of PPI was closely related to the NF-\u03baB pathway. Moreover, NF-\u03baB inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p65, and p65 overexpression eliminated PPI's inhibitory effect. In addition, PPI attenuated the bone erosion and synovitis, as well as M1-like macrophage and T cell infiltration, in the ankle joint of the CIA model. Conclusion: PPI demonstrated effective amelioration of synovial inflammation in the ankle joint of CIA mice while suppressing NF-\u03baB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory effectors in activated macrophages."

                "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) effect of Lonicerin (LON), a safe compound with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Nevertheless, the exact role of LON in RA remains elusive. In this test, the anti-RA effect of LON was evaluated in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Relevant parameters were measured during the experiment; ankle tissue and serum were collected at the end of the experiment for radiology, histopathology, and inflammation analysis. ELISA, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot were used to explore the effect of LON on the polarization of macrophages and related signal pathways. It was discovered that LON treatment attenuated the disease progression of CIA mice with lower paw swelling, clinical score, mobility, and inflammatory response. LON treatment significantly decreased M1 marker levels in CIA mice and LPS/IFN-\u03b3-induced RAW264.7 cells, while slightly increasing M2 marker levels in CIA mice and IL-4-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, LON attenuated the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which contributes to M1 macrophage polarization and inflammasome activation. In addition, LON inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in M1 macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation by inhibiting IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 release. These results indicated that LON might exert anti-RA effects by regulating the polarization of M1/M2 macrophage, especially by inhibiting macrophage polarization toward M1."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The stems of Tinospora sinensis (Lour.) Merr commonly named \"Kuan-Jin-Teng\" in Chinese, have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis as a Tibetan medicine. PURPOSE: The effects of the EtOAc fraction of ethanolic extract from the stems of T. sinensis (KJT) on the pro-inflammatory cytokines and MAPK pathway were studied in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. STUDY DESIGN: Anti-arthritic activity of KJT was investigated in CIA model. METHODS: The chemical constituents of KJT were analyzed by LC-MS and HPLC. The CIA model was established with injecting the bovine CII emulsified in Freund's adjuvant in Wistar rats. Several doses of KJT (50.0, 100.0 and 200.0\u00a0mg/kg) were administrated via oral gavage to CIA rats daily for 4 weeks. The anti-arthritic activity of KJT was investigated by clinical arthritis scoring, paw swelling inspection and hyperalgesia measurement, as well as radiological and histological analysis in CIA rats. The impacts of KJT on the activation of MAPK pathway, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17) in ankle joints, serum, and spleen in CIA rats were examined by western blot, immunohistochemical staining, ELISA, and quantitative real-time PCR respectively. Lastly, the effects of KJT on production of the nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the regulation of the phosphorylation of p38 and Erk were detected in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. RESULTS: KJT significantly alleviated the paw swelling, hyperalgesia and arthritic severity, and reduced the synovial tissue proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration in the CIA rats. Moreover, KJT suppressed the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17 in ankle joints, serum, and spleen and reversed the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of p38 and Erk in CIA rats. KJT was also demonstrated to inhibit the production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), and phosphorylation of p38 and Erk in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the mechanisms of KJT performing its anti-arthritis effect may be attributed to inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulating the MAPK signaling pathway."

The RA cell model was simulated following the treatment of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). After the treatment of various concentrations of plumbagin, the impact of plumbagin on the cell viability was examined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was established using the solution of bovine type II collagen. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the changes of ankle joint tissue, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot were applied to detect the level of inflammatory cytokines. Plumbagin inhibited the viability of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS) at the concentration of 1\u00a0~\u00a03.5\u00a0\u03bcM. The inhibitory effect of 1\u00a0\u03bcM plumbagin on cell proliferation was similar to that of methotrexate, the drug used as the positive control. Plumbagin downregulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in IL-1\u03b2-treated HFLS, and suppressed the activation of I\u03baB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) as well as the entry of p65 into the nucleus. It was also demonstrated in animal experiments that plumbagin inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway, down-regulated the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and MMPs, and alleviated joint damage in CIA-modeled mice. Collectively speaking, plumbagin might down-regulate the levels of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs through inhibiting the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, thereby attenuating RA-induced damage to cells and joints.Abbreviations: CIA: Collagen-induced arthritis; ELISA: Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay; HFLS: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes; IL-6: Interleukin-6; IL-1\u03b2: Interleukin-1\u03b2; NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor kappa-B; MTT: 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; MMPs: Matrix metalloproteinase; OD: Optical density; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; SDS: Sodium dodecyl sulfate; SD: Standard deviation; TNF-\u03b1: Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1; PVDF: Polyvinylidene fluoride."

Chebulanin is a natural polyphenol acid isolated from the traditional Tibetan medicine Terminalia chebula Retz that has previously been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of chebulanin and explore its underlying mechanisms in vivo and in vitro using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW264.7 cell inflammation model. Arthritis severity scores were assessed twice weekly; the levels of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in serum were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits; histopathological assessment was performed using micro computed tomography and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were assessed using western blotting. The inhibition of translocation of cytosolic p38 and p65 into the nucleus was observed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting in vitro. Chebulanin significantly suppressed the progression and development of RA in CIA mice by decreasing the arthritis severity scores, attenuating paw swelling and joint destruction, and reducing the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, chebulanin reduced the levels of excised phosphorylated (p)-p38, phosphorylated-c-JUN N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), p-p65 and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB inhibitor alpha (p-I\u03baB\u03b1) in CIA mice, but did not affect the level of phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In addition, chebulanin could inhibit the nuclear translocation of p38 and p65 in LPS-stimulated macrophages in dose-dependent manner.

Previous research showed that SKN has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects, and inhibits the development of arthritis and the condition of collagen arthritis (CIA) mice; nevertheless, its role in the angiogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate the antiangiogenic activity of SKN in CIA rats and various angiogenesis models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The anti-arthritic effect of SKN on CIA rats was tested by arthritis score, arthritis incidence, radiological observation and histopathology evaluation of inflamed joints. Vessel density evaluated with CD31 immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence in joint synovial membrane tissues of CIA rats, chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, rat aortic ring assay, and the migration, invasion, adhesion and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were used to measured the antiangiogenenic activity of SKN. Moreover, the effect of SKN on the expression of angiogenic mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGFR2, TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 in sera and joint synovia of rats, and in TNF-\u03b1-induced MH7A/HUVEC cells were measured by immunohistochemistry, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Through the analysis of protein and mRNA levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and PTEN, and the autophosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 in joint synovia of rats and in TNF-\u03b1-induced HUVEC cells, the molecular mechanism of its inhibition was elucidated by using Western blot and/or real-time PCR. RESULTS: SKN significantly reduced the arthritis score and arthritis incidence, and inhibited inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage and bone destruction of inflamed joints in CIA rats. Partially, SKN remarkably decreased the immature blood vessels in synovial membrane tissues of inflamed joints from CIA rats. It also suppressed in vivo angiogenesis in chick embryo and VEGF165-induced microvessel sprout formation ex vivo. Meanwhile, SKN inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced migration, invasion, adhesion and tube formation of HUVEC cells. Moreover, SKN significantly decreased the expression of angiogenic activators including VEGF, VEGFR2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, PDGF and TGF-\u03b2 in synovia of CIA rats and/or in MH7A/HUVEC cells. More interestingly, SKN downregulated PI3K and Akt, and simultaneously upregulated PTEN both at protein and mRNA levels in synovia tissues and/or in TNF-\u03b1-induced HUVEC cells. It also suppressed the phosphorylation and gene level of TNF-\u03b1-induced signaling molecules, as ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 in synovium and/or in TNF-\u03b1-induced HUVEC cells. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate for the first time that SKN has the anti-angiogenic effect in RA in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro by interrupting the PI3K/AKT and MAPKs signaling pathways."

It has long been used for dispelling wind-dampness, unblocking meridians, and stopping diarrhea and dysentery. Previous investigations have revealed that 50% ethanolic extract of G. Wilfordii has anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation activities on TNF-\u03b1 induced murine fibrosarcoma L929\u00a0cells. Corilagin (COR) is a main compound in G. Wilfordii with the content up to 1.69\u00a0mg/g. Pharmacology study showed that COR has anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-microorganism, anti-oxidant, and hepatoprotective effects. However, there is no any investigation on its anti-proliferation and anti-inflammation effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The anti-proliferation activity of COR was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and the anti-migration and anti-invasion activity of COR was determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. Furthermore, apoptosis assay by flow cytometer was used to measure the pro-apoptotic effect of COR. The mRNA expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, COX-2, and iNOS were measured by qRT-PCR, and related protein were further verified by ELISA kits or Western blot.

The nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB-p65 was detected by immunofluorescent staining. In vivo, adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model was used, and the body weight, paw swelling, and arthritis score during the entire period were measured. Histopathological analysis of joints of synovial tissues was also determined. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17 were measured. RESULTS: The in vitro results showed that COR could dose-dependently inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of IL-1\u03b2-induced MH7A cells, as well as promote its apoptosis. Moreover, it also suppressed the over-expression of Bcl-2, IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, COX-2, and iNOS while up-regulated the level of Bax. Besides, the ratios of P-p65/p65, P-I\u03baB\u03b1/I\u03baB\u03b1, P-ERK/ERK, P-JNK/JNK, and P-p38/p38 were decreased, and the nuclear translocation of p65 induced by IL-1\u03b2 was blocked by COR. In vivo results indicated that COR significantly reduced the paw swelling and arthritis score in AIA rats, and inhibited synovial tissue hyperplasia and erosion, as well as inflammatory cells infiltration. It also decreased the serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17) production. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that COR exerted anti-rheumatoid arthritis effect, and its underlying mechanisms may be related to inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of synovial fibroblasts, enhancing cell apoptosis, and suppressing inflammatory responses via downregulating NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways."

                "abstract": "Securidaca inappendiculata (SI) Hassk. is a traditional medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies have reported that macrophages are the primary regulators of joint homeostasis and their polarization is closely related to their metabolic mode. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the joint protective effect of SI's xanthone-rich fraction (XRF) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats and the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-glycolysis-polarization axis of macrophages. CIA model rats were treated with oral XRF and therapeutic efficacy was assessed based on arthritis score, degree of paw swelling, histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis. Serum levels of cytokines, cellular metabolite concentrations, and protein and mRNA expression were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting (WB), and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), respectively. The effects of dihydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyxanthone (XAN), a representative SI-derived compound, on RAW264.7 macrophages was analyzed in vitro using confocal laser scanning and flow cytometry. We found that XRF treatment significantly alleviated disease severity in CIA model rats. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and M1 markers in synovium were reduced after XRF treatment, accompanied by an increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and M2 markers. Further, XRF significantly suppressed synovial glycolysis by regulating NAMPT. In vitro studies further showed that XAN induced repolarization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages with M1-M2 phenotype. Moreover, XAN negatively regulated glycolysis in the LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages in correlation with changes in NAMPT expression. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the joint protective effects of XRF are achieved by inhibiting the NAMPT/glycolysis pathway and thereby regulating macrophage polarization."

However, the underlying mechanism of SW remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effect of SW and its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CIA rat model in vivo, and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated synoviocytes or chondrocytes and a co-culture system (IL-1\u03b2-stimulated synoviocytes/chondrocytes) in vitro were used to evaluate the effects of SW on the treatment of RA. Arthritic score, paw swelling rate, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and Safranin-O-Fast green (S-O) staining were used to evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of SW in CIA rats. TUNEL assay or flow cytometry were performed to measure chondrocytes apoptosis in vivo and invitro. The effects of SW on the expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed by qRT-PCR and Elisa. The inhibitory effects of SW on the phosphorylation of p38, Erk1/2, and STAT3 were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: SW treatment significantly alleviated paw swelling, severity of arthritic and cartilage destruction in CIA rats. Moreover, SW decreased the expression of mRNAs of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the synovium, suppressed the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and hind paws, downregulated the protein expression of p-p38, p-Erk1/2 and p-STAT3, and protected the chondrocytes apoptosis in CIA rats. Consistent with the results in vivo, SW also inhibited the activation of MAPK and STAT3 pathways, suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated synoviocytes, and attenuated chondrocytes apoptosis in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes. In the co-culture system, SW pre-treatment in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated synoviocytes exhibited inhibition of chondrocytes apoptosis, which was associated with attenuation of inflammation in synoviocytes. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the underlying mechanisms by which SW exerts its anti-arthritis effect may be related to the reduction of proinflammatory cytokine levels, inhibition of p38, Erk1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation, and attenuating of chondrocyte apoptosis."

(\u0f66\u0f7a\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f63\u0fa1\u0f7a\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d, RG) is a traditional Tibetan medicinal plant that is currently grown throughout Tibet. According to the theory of Tibetan medicine, RG is efficient for removing rheumatism, reducing swelling, and relieving pain. Hence, it has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Tibet for many years. However, there are no previous reports on the anti-RA activities of ethyl acetate extract of RG (RGEA). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the anti-RA effect and mechanism of RGEA on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CIA model was established in male Wister rats by intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen and Complete Freund's Adjuvant at the base of the tail and left sole, respectively. The rats were orally administered with RGEA (9.71, 19.43, or 38.85\u00a0mg/kg) for 23 days. The body weight, swelling volume, arthritis index score, thymus and spleen indices, and pathological changes were observed to evaluate the effect of RGEA on RA. Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines in serum, such as interleukin1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin6 (IL-6), interleukin17 (IL-17), interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3), interleukin4 (IL-4), and interleukin10 (IL-10) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of RGEA. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining was used to examine apoptosis. Finally, the protein and gene expression of B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Caspase3, janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), suppressor of cytokine signaling1 (SOCS1), and 3 (SOCS3) in synovial tissue were detected using immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: After the treatment with RGEA, the body weight of rats was restored, both the arthritis index and paw swelling were suppressed, and spleen and thymus indices were decreased. RGEA reduced the inflammatory cells and synovial hyperplasia in the synovial tissue of the knee joint, and suppressed bone erosion. Meanwhile, RGEA decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, and INF-\u03b3, while increased the levels of IL-4 and IL-10. TUNEL fluorescence apoptosis results confirmed that RGEA obviously promoted the apoptosis of synovial cells. Further studies showed that RGEA inhibited the proteins and mRNAs expression of JAK2 and STAT3 as well as increased the proteins and mRNAs expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. In addition, RGEA upregulated the expression of Bax and Caspase3, and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: The anti-RA effectof RGEA might be related to the promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of inflammation, which regulated the JAK-STAT pathway."

Its efficacy is to relieve inflammation, dispel cold, remove dampness, and alleviate pain. However, its anti-RA mechanism is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effect of QSD on rheumatoid arthritis and explore its anti-inflammatory mechanism against human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLSs) by regulating the notch family of receptors (NOTCH1)/Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)/nucleotide-binding (NLRP3) pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to identify the chemical composition of QSD. Then, HFLSs were exposed to drug-containing serum. The effect of QSD drug-containing serum on HFLS viability was detected using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Next, we explored the anti-inflammatory effect of QSD using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-18 (IL-18), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The expression of NOTCH-related proteins, a member of the NOTCH1, Cleaved NOTCH1, hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES-1), NF-\u03baB p65, NF-\u03baB pp65, NLRP3, and delta-like 1 (DLL-1), was examined using western blotting. Furthermore, the relative mRNA expression levels of NOTCH1, NF-\u03baB p65, NLRP3, DLL-1, and HES-1 were detected using real-time quantitative (RT-qPCR). To explore the mechanism underlying the anti-RA effect of QSD, we the used the NOTCH signaling pathway inhibitor LY411575 and transfection with a NOTCH1 siRNA. In addition, we employed immunofluorescence to determine the expression of HES-1 and NF-\u03baB p65 in vitro. RESULT: Our results revealed that QSD ameliorated inflammation in HFLSs. Compared with the model group, the QSD drug-containing serum group had obviously down-regulated levels of IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. Consistently, the CCK-8 results showed that the QSD drug-containing serum had no obvious toxicity towards HFLSs. Moreover, both LY411575 and siNOTCH1, QSD could reduce NOTCH1, NLRP3, and HES-1 protein expression levels, and LY411575 could significantly inhibit the expression levels of NF-\u03baB p65, NF-\u03baB pp65, and Cleaved NOTCH1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). siNOTCH1 could also suppress the expression of DLL-1. The RT-qPCR results indicated that QSD could downregulate the relative mRNA expression levels of NOTCH1, NF-\u03baB p65, NLRP3, DLL-1, and HES-1 in HFLSs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the immunofluorescence experiment, the fluorescence intensities of HES-1 and NF-\u03baB p65 in HFLSs were found to decrease after exposure to QSD drug-containing serum (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Ultimately, 44 chemical components were detected in QSD using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that the QSD can markedly ameliorate inflammation induced by TNF-\u03b1 on HFLS. The effect of QSD on HFLS may be exerted by inhibition of the NOTCH1/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 signaling pathway."

The pathogenesis of RA is complex with multiple targets and links. This study aims to investigate pharmacological effects and mechanism of Rhodojaponin III in RA. METHODS: The bovine type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) model were constructed. Different concentrations of Rhodojaponin III were utilized for intervention. The progression of CIA was assessed by the arthritis index (AI). Pathological changes in knee joints and synovium were observed. The expressions of angiogenesis-related cytokines were detected. The proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of HUVECs were detected. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined. The expressions of nuclear factor kappa B-inducing kinase (NIK) pathway-related proteins were analyzed. The binding of Rhodojaponin III to NIK was simulated by molecular docking. RESULTS: Rhodojaponin III suppressed cartilage damage and bone erosion in the knee joints. Rhodojaponin III inhibited expressions of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) to decrease vascular density. Rhodojaponin III suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of HUVECs, and decreased the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. Molecular docking showed that Rhodojaponin III could spontaneously bind to NIK. Rhodojaponin III decreased the expression of NIK, p52, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and the phosphorylation level of I\u03baB kinase-alpha (IKK\u03b1) in the synovium of CIA rats and TNF-\u03b1-induced HUVECs. NIK overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of Rhodojaponin III on activation of the NIK/NF-\u03baB pathway, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of HUVECs, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Rhodojaponin III affected the angiogenesis and inflammation of CIA rats and TNF-\u03b1-induced HUVECs by regulating the NIK/IKK\u03b1/CXCL12 pathway. These findings suggest that Rhodojaponin III has potential as a therapeutic agent for RA. Further studies are needed to explore its precise mechanism of action and evaluate its clinical efficacy."

                "abstract": "Berberine (BBR) is a traditional folk medicine with excellent anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effects of BBR in adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rats and its regulatory role in the polarization of macrophages. Rats were immunized with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), and then BBR (40, 80, 160\u202fmg/kg) was administered orally for 14 days. BBR significantly reduced paw swelling and arthritis global assessment as well as alleviated joint destruction and inflammatory cell infiltration. The index of the thymus and thymocyte proliferation were significantly reduced by BBR. Moreover, BBR treatment restrained the phagocytic function of macrophages and restored the balance of M1/M2 by reducing the levels of M1 cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-6), increasing the levels of M2 cytokines (interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21), increasing the expression of arginase 1(Arg1) (M2 marker) and decreasing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (M1 marker). BBR also downregulated the ratio of Th17/Treg cells. Further research on the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway found that BBR upregulated the activity of AMPK, while it downregulated the expression of phospho-RelA (p-p65), phospho-NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (p-I\u03baB\u03b1) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Therefore, our findings suggest BBR has significantly therapeutic effects in AA rats by regulating the polarization of macrophages through the AMPK/NF-\u043aB pathway."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To observe the multiple immunoregulating effects of beta-endorphin (beta-END) on synovium cells of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats and to determine whether the regulation involves the transcriptional factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal pathway. METHODS: CIA was induced in female Wistar rats by immunization with native bovine type-II collagen emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Synovial cells in the knees of the CIA rats were cultivated, and the effects of beta-END, beta-END receptor inhibitor (naloxone, Nal) in proliferation and apoptosis of the synovial cells were assayed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, flow cytometry, and DNA integrity, respectively. The effects of beta-END and Nal on mRNA expression of several cytokines in the synovial cells, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were estimated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Effects of beta-END and Nal on NF-kappaB activity were analyzed using luciferase gene reporter assays. The effects of beta-END and Nal on p65NF-kappaB expression of the synovial cells were examined using Western blot. RESULTS: 75% of the rats were demonstrated to have established the CIA model successfully. beta-END was shown to exert multiple effects on synovial cells of CIA rats including decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis, and downregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, RANTES, iNOS, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression. beta-END seemed to play an immunoregulating role by downregulating the activity and expression of NF-kappaB. It was found that the beta-END receptor blockage could counteract all the effects. CONCLUSIONS: beta-END ameliorates synovial cell functions of CIA rats through binding with receptors and downregulating the NF-kappaB signal pathway. This suggests that beta-END, by blocking the activity and expression of NF-kappaB, is a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic agent against CIA."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and arthritic pain. Sinomenine (SIN), derived from the rhizome of Chinese medical herb Qing Teng (scientific name: Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. Et Wils), has a longstanding use in Chinese traditional medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis. It has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and immunosuppressive effects with minimal side-effects clinically. However, the mechanisms governing its effects in treatment of joint pathology, especially on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) dysfunction, and arthritic pain remains unclear. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of SIN on arthritic joint inflammation and joint FLSs dysfunctions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in rats and the therapeutic effects of SIN on joint pathology were evaluated histopathologically. Next, we conducted a series of experiments using LPS-induced FLSs, which were divided into five groups (Na\u00efve, LPS, SIN 10, 20, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). The expression of inflammatory factors was measured by qPCR and ELISA. The invasive ability of cells was detected by modified Transwell assay and qPCR. Transwell migration and cell scratch assays were used to assess the migration ability of cells. The distribution and content of relevant proteins were observed by immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscopy, as well as Western Blot and qPCR. FLSs were transfected with plasmids (CRMP2 T514A/D) to directly modulate the post-translational modification of CRMP2 protein and downstream effects on FLSs function was monitored. RESULTS: SIN alleviated joint inflammation in rats with CIA, as evidenced by improvement of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration and cartilage damage, as well as inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines release from FLSs induced by LPS. In vitro studies revealed a concentration-dependent suppression of SIN on the invasion and migration of FLSs induced by LPS. In addition, SIN downregulated the expression of cellular CRMP2 that was induced by LPS in FLSs, but increased its phosphorylation at residue T514. Moreover, regulation of pCRMP2 T514 by plasmids transfection (CRMP2 T514A/D) significantly influenced the migration and invasion of FLSs. Finally, SIN promoted nuclear translocation of pCRMP2 T514 in FLSs. CONCLUSIONS: SIN may exert its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects by modulating CRMP2 T514 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation of FLSs, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and suppressing abnormal invasion and migration. Phosphorylation of CRMP2 at the T514 site in FLSs may present a new therapeutic target for treating inflammatory joint's destruction and arthritic pain in RA."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder associated with joint damage and attendant cardiovascular complications. Wedelolactone (Wed), derived from Eclipta alba, possesses anti-inflammatory activity. Whether Wed regulates RA inflammation and related heart damage remains unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was well-established by two subcutaneous injections of type II collagen (days 0 and 21). Wed was then administered via intraperitoneal injection every other day from day 28 to day 48. Joint swelling was monitored and paw thickness was calculated. Histopathological changes in synovial tissues or ankle cartilage were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Safranin O-Fast Green staining. The concentrations of inflammatory factors in serum and synovial tissues were detected by ELISA. The qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed to assess receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa ligand (RANKL), matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-3, NLRP3, caspase-1 (pro- and cleaved forms), p-p65, I\u03baB\u03b1, p-I\u03baB\u03b1, p65, \u03b1smooth-actin 2 (ACTA2), collagen type I and E-cadherin expression. H&E and Masson staining were used to assess the pathological alterations in the heart. RESULTS: Treatment with Wed ameliorated ankle joint swelling and cartilage degradation. Wed decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-18), and the expression of RANKL and MMP-3 in serum and synovial tissues of CIA mice. Moreover, Wed increased the expression of NLRP3 and cleaved-caspase-1 in the synovium, leading to IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) activation in synovial tissues was suppressed by Wed, as manifested by reduced phosphorylation of p65 and I\u03baB\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of p65. Furthermore, Wed reduced in CIA mice heart weight/body weight ratio and dampened cardiac inflammation and fibrosis that was accompanied at the mRNA level by down-regulation of ACTA2 and collagen I and up-regulation of E-cadherin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that Wed attenuated synovial inflammation and joint damage in a mouse model of RA via inhibiting NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and ameliorated RA-induced cardiac complications."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glaucocalyxin B (Gla B) is a type of sesquiterpenoids. At present, there are rare studies on the pharmacological effects and targets of sesquiterpenoids, while multiple sesquiterpenoids have good anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of Gla B on macrophages and rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: LPS/IFN-\u03b3 was used to induce M1 polarization of synovial macrophage (SMG) in vitro, followed by Gla B pretreatment (5 \u03bcM and 15 \u03bcM). Afterwards, flow cytometry was performed to detect the proportion of M1 cells (F4/80+CD86+), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the expression levels of M1 cell markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS and IL-12) as well as M2 cell markers (IL-10 and TGF- \u03b21), immunofluorescence (IF) staining was utilized to measure the expression of CD86, the level of ROS was assessed by probe and Western blot was conducted to detect the expression of P65 and p-P65. M1 polarization was detected in SMG cells with P65 silencing after 15 \u03bcM Gla B intervention. The culture medium from M1 cell was used to culture cartilage cells in vitro, followed by detection of cartilage cell injury. In animal models, collagen antibodies and LPS were combined to induce RA mouse model. Afterwards, H and E staining was performed to detect pathological changes in mouse joint synovium, safranin O-fast green staining was used to determine cartilage injury, and immunohistochemistry was utilized to detect CD86 and P65 expression. Small molecule-protein docking and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were used to verify the targeted binding relationship between Gal B and P65. RESULTS: LPS and IFN-\u03b3 could induce M1 polarization in SMG. Gal B could inhibit M1 polarization, decrease the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS and IL-12, inhibit the expression of P65 and p-P65 while did not affect the expression of IL-10 or TGF-\u03b21. Gal B had no significant effect in SMG cells with P65 silencing. The small molecule-protein docking and Co-IP both showed that Gal B had a targeted binding relationship with P65, and Gal B could inhibit joint injury and inflammation in mice. CONCLUSION: Gal B could target the P65 protein. Moreover, Gal B could inhibit the inflammatory injury of articular cartilage in RA by regulating M1 polarization of SMG through inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease characterized by chronic synovial infiltration and proliferation, cartilage destruction, and joint injury. Ginkgolide B (GB) is an extract of the leaves of Ginkgo biloba, and pharmacological studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-RA properties of GB. METHODS: In vivo, we established a collagen II-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Mice were divided into five groups (n=10): sham, CIA, GB (10 \u00b5M), GB (20 \u00b5M), and GB (40 \u00b5M). We measured arthritis score, synovial histopathological change, and peripheral blood cytokine levels. In vitro, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) as the study subject. Cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokines levels were detected by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Finally, the protein expression of wingless-type family member 5A (Wnt5a), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) p65 were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Arthritis scores, synovial hyperplasia, and cartilage and bone destruction were significantly ameliorated by GB. Additionally, GB decreased the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13, and increased IL-10. In vitro, we found that GB remarkably inhibited RA-FLSs viability at 24 or 48 h in a concentration-dependent manner. The apoptotic ratio was reduced by GB, and it increased the expression of cleaved-Caspase-3 and Bax while decreasing Bcl-2 expression in RA-FLSs. Furthermore, GB attenuated the progression of inflammation by mediating inflammatory cytokine release and MMPs gene expression. Meanwhile, GB inactivated the expression levels of Wnt5a, phosphorylated (p)-JNK, and p-P65 in the synovial tissues and RA-FLSs. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to demonstrate that the anti-RA effect of GB is related to reducing articular cartilage and bone destruction, inducing RA-FLSs apoptosis, and regulating inflammatory cytokine release and the Wnt5a/JNK/NF-\u03baB axis. All the findings highlight that GB might provide a novel treatment approach for RA."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Divergent therapeutic outcomes on different disease domains have been noted with IL-23 and IL-17A-blockade in PsA. Therefore, elucidating the role of ROR\u03b3t, the master regulator of type 17 immune responses, is of potential therapeutic interest. To this end, ROR\u03b3t inhibition was assessed in combined skin, joint and gut inflammation in vivo, using a PsA model. METHODS: We tested the efficacy of a ROR\u03b3t antagonist in B10.RIII mice challenged with systemic overexpression of IL-23 by hydrodynamic injection of IL-23 enhanced episomal vector (IL-23 EEV). Clinical outcomes were evaluated by histopathology. Bone density and surface erosions were examined using micro-computed tomography. Cytokine production was measured in serum and by intracellular flow cytometry. Gene expression in PsA-related tissues was analysed by qPCR. RESULTS: ROR\u03b3t-blockade significantly ameliorated psoriasis, peripheral arthritis and colitis development in IL-23 EEV mice (improvement of clinical scores and weight loss respectively by 91.8%, 58.2% and 7.0%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), in line with profound suppression of an enhanced type IL-17 immune signature in PsA-affected tissues. Moreover, inflammation-induced bone loss and bone erosions were reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.05 in calcaneus, P\u2009<\u20090.01 in tibia). Sustained IL-23 overexpression resulted in only mild signs of sacroiliitis. Gamma-delta (\u03b3\u03b4)-T cells, the dominant source of T cell-derived IL-17A and IL-22, were expanded during IL-23 overexpression, and together with Th17 cells, clearly countered by ROR\u03b3t inhibition (P\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: ROR\u03b3t-blockade shows therapeutic efficacy in a preclinical PsA model with protection towards extra-musculoskeletal manifestations, reflected by a clear attenuation of type 17 cytokine responses by \u03b3\u03b4-T cells and Th17 cells."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Th17 cells and its effective cytokine IL-17A play an important role in the pathogenesis of abnormal immune responses in psoriasis. Notch1 signaling has been implicated in Th17 cell differentiation and function. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the possible inhibitory effect of Notch1 signaling inhibitor, \u03b3-secretase inhibitor DAPT, on psoriatic Th17 cell differentiation and function in a mouse model of psoriasis-like skin inflammation. METHODS: Mouse psoriasis-like skin inflammation model was established by topical 5% imiquimod (IMQ) application, and experimental mice were divided into control group, IMQ-treated group and IM\u2009+\u2009DAPT-treated group. DAPT and the equivalent amount of Dimethyl sulfoxide was intraperitoneally injected in IMQ\u2009+\u2009DAPT-treated group and the other two experimental groups respectively. Skin tissues of the three experimental groups were acquired and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Splenic single-cells and serum were collected to detect the percentage of Th17 cells, the mRNA expression levels of Notch1 and its target gene Hes-1, Th17-specific transcription factor ROR\u03b3t and its effective cytokines IL-17A, as well as IL-17A serum concentration. In addition, splenic CD4+ T cells from IMQ-treated mice were isolated and treated by DAPT to further measure the inhibitory effect of DAPT on the Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A secretion in vitro. RESULTS: DAPT treatment alleviated the severity of IMQ-induced mouse psoriasis-like skin inflammation and decreased the scores of erythema, scaling and thickening. HE stain reveals obviously reduced epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammatory cells infiltration in IMQ\u2009+\u2009DAPT-treated mice. The increased expression of splenic Th17 cell percentage, along with Notch1, Hes-1, ROR\u03b3t and IL-17A mRNA and IL-17A serum concentration in IMQ-treated mice were significantly decreased when experimental mice were treated by IMQ and DAPT combinedly. Data obtained from in vitro study in IMQ-treated mice also demonstrated that blocking Notch1 signaling by DAPT can result in a dose-dependent decrease of Th17 cell proportion, mRNA expression of Notch1, Hes-1, ROR\u03b3t and IL-17A as well as IL-17A secretion in splenic CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Notch1 inhibition by DAPT can effectively alleviate the severity of mouse psoriasis-like skin inflammation by regulating the differentiation and function of Th17 cells, indicating that DAPT might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of psoriatic inflammation."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Interleukin (IL)-23 is essential for the development of various experimental autoimmune models. However, the role of IL-23 in non-autoimmune experimental arthritis remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of IL-23 in the non-autoimmune antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) model. In addition, the regulatory potential of IL-23 in IL-17A and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORgammat) expression in CD4+ and TCRgammadelta+ T cells was evaluated systemically as well as at the site of inflammation. METHODS: Antigen-induced arthritis was induced in wild-type, IL-23p19-deficient and IL-17 Receptor A - knockout mice. At different time points, synovial cytokine and chemokine expression was measured. At days 1 and 7 of AIA, splenocytes and joint-infiltrating cells were isolated and analyzed for intracellular IL-17A and interferon (IFN)-gamma ex-vivo by flow cytometry. In splenic CD4+ and TCRgammadelta+ T cells gene expression was quantified by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: IL-23 was critical for full-blown AIA. Lack of IL-23 did not prevent the onset of joint inflammation but stopped the progression to a destructive synovitis. IL-23 regulated IL-17A expression in CD4+ T cells in the spleen. Of note, IL-17A and IFN-gamma expression was reduced in CD4+ T cells in the inflamed joints of IL-23p19-deficient mice. Interestingly, IL-23 was also critical for the induction of IL-17A and RORgammat but not IFN-gamma in TCRgammadelta+ T cells in the inflamed joints. The importance of the IL-23/IL-17 axis was further confirmed using IL-17 Receptor A knockout mice showing significantly milder AIA compared to control mice, with a disease course comparable to that of IL-23p19-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that IL-23 is critical for full-blown expression of a non-autoimmune destructive arthritis and regulates the proportion of IL-17A and IFN-gamma-positive CD4+ T cells at the site of inflammation. Furthermore, IL-23 regulates IL-17A and RORgammat expression in TCRgammadelta T cells in arthritis. These findings indicate that regulating the IL-23 pathway may have therapeutic potential in non-autoimmune arthritis."

                "abstract": "IL-17-producing CD4(+)Th17 cells, CD8(+)Tc17 cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune psoriasis. ROR\u03b3t is required for the differentiation of Th17 cells and expression of IL-17. In this article, we describe a novel, potent, and selective ROR\u03b3t inverse agonist (TMP778), and its inactive diastereomer (TMP776). This chemistry, for the first time to our knowledge, provides a unique and powerful set of tools to probe ROR\u03b3t-dependent functions. TMP778, but not TMP776, blocked human Th17 and Tc17 cell differentiation and also acutely modulated IL-17A production and inflammatory Th17-signature gene expression (Il17a, Il17f, Il22, Il26, Ccr6, and Il23) in mature human Th17 effector/memory T cells. In addition, TMP778, but not TMP776, inhibited IL-17A production in both human and mouse \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. IL-23-induced IL-17A production was also blocked by TMP778 treatment. In vivo targeting of ROR\u03b3t in mice via TMP778 administration reduced imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like cutaneous inflammation. Further, TMP778 selectively regulated Th17-signature gene expression in mononuclear cells isolated from both the blood and affected skin of psoriasis patients. In summary, to our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that ROR\u03b3t inverse agonists: 1) inhibit Tc17 cell differentiation, as well as IL-17 production by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and CD8(+) Tc17 cells; 2) block imiquimod-induced cutaneous inflammation; 3) inhibit Th17 signature gene expression by cells isolated from psoriatic patient samples; and 4) block IL-23-induced IL-17A expression. Thus, ROR\u03b3t is a tractable drug target for the treatment of cutaneous inflammatory disorders, which may afford additional therapeutic benefit over existing modalities that target only IL-17A. "

                "abstract": "Increased IL-17-producing helper T (Th17) cells have been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The retinoic-acid-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR\u03b3t) is the master regulator of Th17 cells. Our previous research showed that FC99 possesses anti-inflammation activity. However, to date the effects of FC99 on ROR\u03b3t expression in Th17 cell differentiation have not been investigated yet. In the present study, we found that FC99 significantly attenuated arthritis-like symptoms, i.e., suppressing the development of paw edema in zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) mice. H&E staining showed that the infiltration of inflammatory cells in ankle synovial tissues was significantly suppressed. FC99 also reduced the mRNA levels of pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines in ankle synovial tissues as shown by Q-PCR analysis. The protein levels of the pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines in sera were also suppressed after FC99 treatment. Moreover, FC99 decreased the ROR\u03b3t mRNA level in spleen tissues. Th17 cell percentage was significantly decreased in spleens and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). The mRNA and protein levels of IL-17A and IL-23 were reduced after FC99 treatment in ZIA mice. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that FC99 inhibited the expression of IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells and BMDCs. Moreover, FC99 significantly inhibited the ROR\u03b3t expression in PMA-induced CD4(+) T cells and LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. These data indicate that FC99 improves arthritis-like pathological symptoms in vivo and in vitro, which might be related to the inhibition of ROR\u03b3t expression in Th17 cells. Our findings suggest that FC99 may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of RA and other in\ufb02ammatory disorders. "

METHODS: A chemical library was screened using cell-based high-throughput methods, luciferase reporter assay, competitive binding assay, and T cell differentiation assay. To evaluate in vivo effects of a novel ROR\u03b3t antagonist, A213, we orally administrated it to two independent mouse models of psoriasis; IL-23-injection model and K5.Stat3C transgenic mouse. RESULTS: Oral administration of A213 resulted in attenuation of skin inflammation in the both mouse models. At the same time, increased levels of IL-17A expression were significantly reduced in the skin lesions and skin-draining lymph nodes.

METHODS: In this study, we performed interleukin-23 (IL-23) gene transfer in wild-type (WT) and T cell receptor \u03b4-deficient (TCR\u03b4-/- ) mice and conducted tissue phenotyping in the joint, skin, and nails to characterize the inflammatory infiltrate. We further performed detailed flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, T cell repertoire analysis, and in vitro T cell polarization assays to identify regulatory mechanisms of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. RESULTS: We demonstrated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells support systemic granulopoiesis, which is critical for murine PsA-like pathology. Briefly, \u03b3\u03b4 T cell ablation inhibited the expression of neutrophil chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 and neutrophil CD11b+Ly6G+ accumulation in the aforementioned PsA-related tissues. Although significantly reduced expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-17A was detected systemically in TCR\u03b4-/- mice, no GM-CSF+/IL-17A+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were detected locally in the inflamed skin or bone marrow in WT mice. Our data showed that nonresident \u03b3\u03b4 T cells regulate the expansion of an CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophil population and their recruitment to joint and skin tissues, where they develop hallmark pathologic features of human PsA. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support the notion that tissue-resident \u03b3\u03b4 T cells initiate the disease but demonstrate a novel role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in neutrophil regulation that can be exploited therapeutically in PsA patients."

The IL-23/IL-17 axis is implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and biologics targeting IL-23 and IL-17 have shown significant clinical efficacy in treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. JNJ-61803534 is a potent ROR\u03b3t inverse agonist, selectively inhibiting ROR\u03b3t-driven transcription versus closely-related family members, ROR\u03b1 and ROR\u03b2. JNJ-61803534 inhibited IL-17A production in human CD4+ T cells under Th17 differentiation conditions, but did not inhibit IFN\u03b3 production under Th1 differentiation conditions, and had no impact on in vitro differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg), nor on the suppressive activity of natural Tregs. In the mouse collagen-induced arthritis model, JNJ-61803534 dose-dependently attenuated inflammation, achieving\u2009~\u200990% maximum inhibition of clinical score. JNJ-61803534 significantly inhibited disease score in the imiquimod-induced mouse skin inflammation model, and dose-dependently inhibited the expression of ROR\u03b3t-regulated genes, including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22 and IL-23R. Preclinical 1-month toxicity studies in rats and dogs identified doses that were well tolerated supporting progression into first-in-human studies. An oral formulation of JNJ-61803534 was studied in a phase 1 randomized double-blind study in healthy human volunteers to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. The compound was well tolerated in single ascending doses (SAD) up to 200 mg, and exhibited dose-dependent increases in exposure upon oral dosing, with a plasma half-life of 164 to 170 h. In addition, dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo stimulated IL-17A production in whole blood was observed, demonstrating in vivo target engagement. In conclusion, JNJ-61803534 is a potent and selective ROR\u03b3t inhibitor that exhibited acceptable preclinical safety and efficacy, as well as an acceptable safety profile in a healthy volunteer SAD study, with clear evidence of a pharmacodynamic effect in humans."

                "abstract": "Background and Aims: Despite the negative results of blocking IL-17 in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, selective modulation of Th17-dependent responses warrants further study. Inhibition of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR\u03b3t), the master regulator of the Th17 signature, is currently being explored in inflammatory diseases. Our aim was to determine the effect of a novel oral ROR\u03b3t antagonist (BI119) in human CD and on an experimental model of intestinal inflammation. Methods: 51 CD patients and 11 healthy subjects were included. The effects of BI119 were tested on microbial-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), intestinal crypts and biopsies from CD patients. The ability of BI119 to prevent colitis in vivo was assessed in the CD4+CD45RBhigh T cell transfer model. Results: In bacterial antigen-stimulated PBMCs from CD patients, BI119 inhibits Th17-related genes and proteins, while upregulating Treg and preserving Th1 and Th2 signatures. Intestinal crypts cultured with supernatants from BI119-treated commensal-specific CD4+ T cells showed decreased expression of CXCL1, CXCL8 and CCL20. BI119 significantly reduced IL17 and IL26 transcription in colonic and ileal CD biopsies and did not affect IL22. BI119 has a more profound effect in ileal CD with additional significant downregulation of IL23R, CSF2, CXCL1, CXCL8, and S100A8, and upregulation of DEFA5. BI119 significantly prevented development of clinical, macroscopic and molecular markers of colitis in the T-cell transfer model. Conclusions: BI119 modulated CD-relevant Th17 signatures, including downregulation of IL23R while preserving mucosa-associated IL-22 responses, and abrogated experimental colitis. Our results provide support to the use of ROR\u03b3t antagonists as a novel therapy to CD treatment."

FINDINGS: Male B10.RIII mice developed arthritis in the forepaws and feet within 6 days after IL-23 EEV injection; they also exhibited psoriasis-like skin disease, colitis, weight loss, and osteopenia. In contrast to previous reports, we did not observe spondylitis or uveitis. Male C57BL/6 mice injected with IL-23 EEV had serum IL-23 levels comparable with B10.RIII mice and developed skin inflammation, colitis, weight loss, and osteopenia but failed to develop arthritis. Female B10.RIII mice had more severe arthritis than male B10.RIII mice but did not lose weight. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of IL-23 induced disease in mice is controlled by genetic background and sex of the animals. The development of extra-articular manifestations but absence of arthritis in C57BL/6 mice suggests that organ-specificity of IL-23 driven inflammation is genetically determined. The mechanisms behind the strain-specific differences and the sexual dimorphism observed in this study may be relevant for human spondyloarthritis and warrant further exploration."

                "abstract": "Objectives: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and cutaneous psoriasis (PsO) are different phenotypes of psoriatic disease (PsD), whose underlying specific mechanisms remain incompletely understood. As cytokines are key elements to induce and tune up immune responses to drive inflammatory diseases, our objective was to assess whether clinical features, disease phenotype and PsA and PsO activity were associated with a particular ex vivo cytokine production profile. Methods: Forty-eight patients (37 PsA and 11 PsO) and 11 healthy subjects (HS) were studied. Cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that were either unstimulated, or stimulated with LPS or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, were analysed by multiplex assay in the culture supernatants. Results: Cytokine signature of PsD includes a high level of TNF\u03b1 in supernatants of LPS-stimulated PBMC, higher levels of IL-6 and lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A after CD3-CD28 stimulation, as well as higher spontaneous IL-1RA and TNF\u03b1 production compared to HS. High body mass index (BMI) was associated with lower levels of IL-1\u03b2, and metabolic syndrome with lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 after LPS stimulation. In PsD, dermatological activity was related with higher IL-17A level, while rheumatic activity was linked with lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. Comparing each PsD subtype to HS, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 productions are higher when using LPS stimulation in PsO patients with higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1 in peripheral PsA patients after CD3/CD28 stimulation. LPS stimulation induced high levels of IL-17A in peripheral PsA compared to axial PsA. PsA patients with axial PsA share some features with PsO but shows a distinct cytokine pattern compared to peripheral PsA. Conclusion: PsO and the different PsA subtypes exhibit distinct ex vivo cytokine production profiles and common features of the so-called PsD. Analysis of IL-1 cytokine family and IL-6 seems to be of particular interest to distinguish PsO and peripheral PsA since it depends on monocytes in PsO and T-lymphocytes in peripheral PsA. Peripheral cytokine profiles are influenced by rheumatic and dermatological activity of the disease, and also by metabolic syndrome features. Our results highlight the crucial role of immune cell interactions with different patterns of interaction depending on clinical phenotype."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The transcription factor IRF4 is involved in several T-cell-dependent chronic inflammatory diseases. To elucidate the mechanisms for pathological cytokine production in colitis, we addressed the role of the IRF transcription factors in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental colitis. METHODS: IRF levels and cytokine production in IBD patients were studied as well as the effects of IRF4 deficiency in experimental colitis. RESULTS: In contrast to IRF1, IRF5, and IRF8, IRF4 expression in IBD was augmented in the presence of active inflammation. Furthermore, IRF4 levels significantly correlated with IL-6 and IL-17 mRNA expression and to a lesser extent with IL-22 mRNA expression in IBD. To further explore the role of IRF4 under in vivo conditions, we studied IRF4-deficient and wildtype mice in experimental colitis. In contrast to DSS colitis, IRF4 deficiency was protective in T-cell-dependent transfer colitis associated with reduced ROR\u03b1/\u03b3t levels and impaired IL-6, IL-17a, and IL-22 production, suggesting that IRF4 acts as a master regulator of mucosal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent mechanistic studies using database analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a novel IRF4 binding site in the IL-17 gene promoter. Overexpression of IRF4 using retroviral infection induced IL-17 production and IL-17 together with IL-6 induced ROR\u03b3t expression. CONCLUSIONS: IRF4 can directly bind to the IL-17 promotor and induces mucosal ROR\u03b3t levels and IL-17 gene expression thereby controlling Th17-dependent colitis. Targeting of this molecular mechanism may lead to novel therapeutic approaches in human IBD."

                "abstract": "T-bet is a key transcription factor for the T helper 1 lineage and its expression level is negatively correlated to inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our previous study using T-bet transgenic mice revealed over-expression of T-bet completely suppressed collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a murine model of RA, indicating a potential suppressive role of T-bet in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis. Here, we show T-bet-deficiency exacerbated CIA. T-bet in CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, but not in CD11c\u2009+\u2009dendritic cells, was critical for regulating the production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and TNF\u03b1 from CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells. T-bet-deficient CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells showed higher ROR\u03b3t expression and increased IL-17A production in ROR\u03b3t-positive cells after CII immunization. In addition, T-bet-deficient na\u00efve CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells showed accelerated Th17 differentiation in vitro. CIA induced in CD4-Cre T-betfl/fl (cKO) mice was more severe and T-bet-deficient CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells in the arthritic joints of cKO mice showed higher ROR\u03b3t expression and increased IL-17A production. Transcriptome analysis of T-bet-deficient CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells revealed that expression levels of Th17-related genes were selectively increased. Our results indicate that T-bet in CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells repressed ROR\u03b3t expression and function resulting in suppression of arthritogenic Th17 cells and CIA."

                "abstract": "Thiostrepton (TST) is a natural antibiotic with pleiotropic properties. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic effect of TST on experimental colitis and identify its targets. The effect of TST on colon inflammation was evaluated in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model and a T-cell transfer colitis model. The therapeutic targets of TST were investigated by cytokine profiling, immunophenotyping and biochemical approaches. The effect of TST on the gut microbiota and its contribution to colitis were evaluated in mice with DSS-induced colitis that were subjected to gut microbiota depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Alterations in the gut microbiota caused by TST were determined by 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing. Here, we showed that TST treatment significantly ameliorated colitis in the DSS-induced and T-cell transfer models. Specifically, TST targeted the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor ROR\u03b3t to reduce the production of IL-17A by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and Th17 cells in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Similarly, TST selectively prevented the development of Th17 cells in the T-cell transfer colitis model and the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells in vitro. Mechanistically, TST induced the ubiquitination and degradation of ROR\u03b3t by promoting the binding of Itch to ROR\u03b3t. Moreover, TST also reversed dysbiosis to control colonic inflammation. Taken together, these results from our study describe the previously unexplored role of TST in alleviating colonic inflammation by reducing IL-17A production and modulating dysbiosis, suggesting that TST is a promising candidate drug for the treatment of IBD."

In other types of inflammatory arthritis, T regulatory cell (Treg) dysfunction and plasticity at sites of inflammation were suggested to negatively affect peripheral tolerance. We here addressed if Treg variances associate with psoriatic disease. We collected clinical data, sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 healthy controls, 21 psoriasis and 21 PsA patients.

We studied characteristics of CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009CD127loFoxp3\u2009+\u2009Tregs by flow cytometry and used ELISA to quantify antibodies against ADAMTSL5, a recently discovered autoantigen in psoriatic disease. In comparison with their circulating counterparts, Tregs from inflamed joints express increased levels of ICOS, CTLA-4 and TIGIT. Furthermore, synovial fluid-derived Tregs have a distinct phenotype, characterized by IL-17A production and upregulation of CD161 and ROR\u03b3t. We identified a subset of Tregs with intermediate Foxp3 expression as the major cytokine producer. Furthermore, ICOS\u2009+\u2009Tregs associate with PsA disease activity as measured by PASDAS. Lastly, we observed that presence of the Foxp3int Tregs associates with an increased abundance of anti-ADAMTSL5 autoantibodies. Tregs derived from the inflammatory environment of inflamed PsA joints exhibit a distinct phenotype, which associates with loss of peripheral immune tolerance in psoriatic disease."

                "abstract": "The nuclear hormone receptor retinoic acid receptor-related-orphan-receptor-gamma t (ROR\u03b3t) is the key transcription factor required for Th17 cell differentiation and for production of IL-17 family cytokines by innate and adaptive immune cells. Dysregulated Th17 immune responses have been associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In this article, we describe the in vitro pharmacology of a potent and selective low molecular weight ROR\u03b3t inhibitor identified after a structure-based hit-to-lead optimization effort. The compound interfered with co-activator binding to the ROR\u03b3t ligand binding domain and impaired the transcriptional activity of ROR\u03b3t as evidenced by blocked IL-17A secretion and RORE-mediated transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene. The inhibitor effectively reduced IL-17A production by human naive and memory T-cells and attenuated transcription of pro-inflammatory Th17 signature genes, such as IL17F, IL22, IL26, IL23R, and CCR6. The compound selectively suppressed the Th17/IL-17 pathway and did not interfere with polarization of other T helper cell lineages. Furthermore, the inhibitor was selective for ROR\u03b3t and did not modify the transcriptional activity of the closely related family members ROR\u03b1 and ROR\u03b2. Using human keratinocytes cultured with supernatants from compound treated Th17 cells we showed that pharmacological inhibition of ROR\u03b3t translated to suppressed IL-17-regulated gene expression in keratinocyte cell cultures. Furthermore, in ex vivo immersion skin cultures our ROR\u03b3t inhibitor suppressed IL-17A production by Th17-skewed skin resident cells which correlated with reduced human \u03b2 defensin 2 expression in the skin. Our data suggests that inhibiting ROR\u03b3t transcriptional activity by a low molecular weight inhibitor may hold utility for the treatment of Th17/IL-17-mediated skin pathologies."

                "abstract": "The management of acute pancreatitis (AP) remains a challenge to clinicians worldwide for limited effective interventions. Retinoid orphan receptor gamma t (ROR\u03b3t) is a therapeutic target for several diseases; however, it is unclear whether inhibiting ROR\u03b3t can ameliorate AP. The relative expression of ROR\u03b3t, IL-17 and IL-23 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of AP patients was measured by RT-PCR. An AP mouse model was induced by ceruletide, and SR1001 was injected before ceruletide administration. ROR\u03b3t+ cells, T helper 17 cells (Th17), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were assessed in the pancreas and spleen by flow cytometry. Higher ROR\u03b3t expression in patients indicated the potential role of ROR\u03b3t in AP progression. Analyses of the IL-17/IL-23 axis confirmed its role. SR1001 significantly alleviated AP histologically in the mouse model. Serum levels of amylase, IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-17 and IL-23 decreased upon SR1001 treatment. SR1001 selectively decreased the number of ROR\u03b3t+, Th17, Tregs and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the pancreas but not the spleen. Collectively, these results showed that SR1001 exerted therapeutic effects on AP by suppressing IL-17-secreting Th17 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the pancreas. Thus, SR1001 may be a promising drug for the treatment of AP in the clinic."

However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating psoriasis with potentially less side effects. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action. A murine model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4+ and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4+FoxP3+ Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including ROR\u03b3t, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. Importantly, it suppressed NF\u03baB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4+ T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates psoriasis and inhibits Th17 development."

We undertook this study to clarify the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of IL-6 blockade in RA and to find a novel target for treatment of RA. METHODS: We examined gene expression profiles of CD4+ T cells by DNA microarray analysis before and after treatment with an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), in RA patients who exhibited good clinical responses to the treatment. Using murine CD4+ T cells, we then examined the roles of a newly identified molecule whose expression was significantly reduced in CD4+ T cells by TCZ therapy. We also examined the effect of the forced expression of the molecule on retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t)-induced IL-17A production in CD4+ T cells and on ROR\u03b3t-induced IL-17A promoter activation. RESULTS: We identified AT-rich-interactive domain- containing protein 5A (ARID-5A) as a new molecule down-regulated by IL-6 blockade in the form of TCZ therapy. IL-6 induced the expression of ARID-5A in CD4+ T cells during Th17 cell differentiation by a STAT-3-dependent mechanism, whereas IL-6-induced ARID-5A expression was not affected by the absence of ROR\u03b3t, a lineage-specifying transcription factor of Th17 cells. Furthermore, ARID-5A physically associated with ROR\u03b3t through its N-terminal region and inhibited ROR\u03b3t-induced Th17 cell differentiation. CONCLUSION: ARID-5A is a lineage-specific attenuator of Th17 cell differentiation and may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA."

Indigo Naturalis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease in which \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play an important role. This study aims to determine the immunoregulatory effects and the underlying mechanisms of Indirubin in psoriasis-related inflammatory responses. METHODS: BALB/c mice with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis were treated with saline (Model), 1\u202fmg/kg methotrexate (MTX) that serves as a positive control, or 12.5, 25 and 50\u202fmg/kg Indirubin(IR) intragastrically. Keratinocytes proliferation, inflammatory cells infiltration, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and Jak/Stat pathway-related proteins in the skin lesion were examined. The abundance of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in lymph nodes and spleen was determined by flow cytometry. The IL-17 expression and secretion, and the activation of Jak3/Stat3 pathways in in vitro cultured \u03b3\u03b4 T cell were tested. RESULTS: Indirubin ameliorated keratinocyte proliferation, reduced the infiltration of CD3+ T cells, IL-17\u202fA-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and CD11b+ neutrophils, inhibited the mRNA expression of Il1, Il6, Il23, Il17a and Il22, and the protein expression of Jak/Stat pathway-related molecules in the skin lesion. Indirubin also reduced the abundance of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell and CCR6+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (the major IL-17\u202fA producer) in spleen and lymph nodes. In cultured \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, Indirubin inhibited the mRNA expression of Il17a and Ifng, and the secretion of IL-17\u202fA, while suppressed the activation of Jak3/Stat3 pathways. CONCLUSION: Indirubin alleviates IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mainly through reducing the inflammatory responses mediated by IL-17\u202fA-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells involving Jak3/Stat3 activation. Our results highlighted the novel mechanisms by which Indirubin ameliorates psoriasis-related inflammatory responses, supporting its therapeutic potential."

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the rapid onset of the effects of ozoralizumab, we compared the biodistribution kinetics of ozoralizumab and adalimumab after subcutaneous injection in an animal model of arthritis. Alexa Fluor 680-labeled ozoralizumab and adalimumab were administered by subcutaneous injection once (2\u00a0mg/kg) at five weeks after induction of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in an animal arthritis model. The time-course of changes in the fluorescence intensities of the two compounds in the paws and serum were evaluated. The paws of the CIA mice were harvested at four and eight hours after the injection for fluorescence microscopy. Biofluorescence imaging revealed better distribution of ozoralizumab to the joint tissues than of adalimumab, as early as at four hours after the injection. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a greater fluorescence intensity of ozoralizumab in the joint tissues than that of adalimumab at eight hours after the injection. Ozoralizumab showed a significantly higher absorption rate constant as compared with adalimumab. These results indicate that ozoralizumab enters the systemic circulation more rapidly and is distributed to the target tissues earlier and at higher levels than conventional IgG antibodies. Our investigation provides new insight into the mechanism underlying the rapid onset of the effects of ozoralizumab in clinical practice."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ozoralizumab (Nanozora), a novel TNF inhibitor, was first approved in Japan in September 2022 as a next-generation antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ozoralizumab potently inhibits TNF action through two human TNF\u03b1-binding domains, and a human serum albumin-binding domain that prolongs its plasma half-life enabling 4-week administration intervals. Its molecular weight is 38 kDa, which is one-fourth that of the conventional immunoglobulin G. AREAS COVERED: Structural characteristics of ozoralizumab, preclinical findings, clinical data, and its recommended positioning in current RA treatments have been summarized. EXPERT OPINION: Studies using mouse models have shown the rapid distribution of ozoralizumab in inflamed joint tissues, presumably because of its small molecular size and albumin-binding action. In clinical studies, remarkable improvements in clinical symptoms and patient-reported outcomes were observed 2\u2009days after subcutaneous administration of 30\u2009mg ozoralizumab with concurrent methotrexate therapy. Moreover, the efficacy and tolerability of the drug for up to 52\u2009weeks, with or without methotrexate, were confirmed. Ozoralizumab is expected to be a highly practical option for patients with RA as a new type of TNF inhibitor with early symptom improvement despite subcutaneous administration."

                "abstract": "Although the introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors represented a significant advance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), traditional anti-TNF\u03b1 antibodies are somewhat immunogenic, and their use results in the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and loss of efficacy (secondary failure). Ozoralizumab is a trivalent, bispecific NANOBODY\u00ae compound that differs structurally from IgGs. In this study we investigated the suppressant effect of ozoralizumab and adalimumab, an anti-TNF\u03b1 IgG, on arthritis and induction of ADAs in human TNF transgenic mice. Ozoralizumab markedly suppressed arthritis progression and did not induce ADAs during long-term administration. We also developed an animal model of secondary failure by repeatedly administering adalimumab and found that switching from adalimumab to ozoralizumab was followed by superior anti-arthritis efficacy in the secondary-failure animal model. Moreover, ozoralizumab did not form large immune complexes that might lead to ADA formation. The results of our studies suggest that ozoralizumab, which exhibited low immunogenicity in the animal model used and has a different antibody structure from that of IgGs, is a promising candidate for the treatment of RA patients not only at the onset of RA but also during secondary failure of anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment."

                "abstract": "Ozoralizumab, a novel TNF inhibitor, is the first NANOBODY\u00ae compound in Japan for rheumatoid arthritis. This compound consists of a humanized fusion protein with a trimeric structure having two anti-human TNF\u03b1 NANOBODY\u00ae molecules and one anti-human serum albumin NANOBODY\u00ae molecule, and has the unique structure without an Fc portion. Ozoralizumab showed an inhibitory effect on TNF\u03b1-induced cell death, and its inhibitory concentration was lower than that of etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab. Ozoralizumab also showed inhibitory effects on human TNF\u03b1-induced cellular infiltration in the murine air pouch model and reduced the arthritis scores in a murine rheumatoid arthritis model. In addition, ozoralizumab showed distinctive pharmacological characteristics different from the traditional IgG antibodies, which may be attributed to its unique structure, such as its ability to rapidly distribute to inflamed joint tissues in a murine rheumatoid arthritis model, and its immune complexes with TNF\u03b1 do not induce inflammation in a murine subcutaneous inflammation model. In clinical trials, ozoralizumab demonstrated clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis patients with inadequate response to methotrexate, which was observed from day 3 of treatment. Ozolalizumab also showed improvements in clinical symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis patients without methotrexate. The safety profile of the compound was not significantly different from that of current TNF inhibitors. Based on these results, ozoralizumab was approved in September 2022. Ozoralizumab shows early improvement of clinical symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and its characteristic structure is expected to be new treatment options for patients who have an inadequate response to current bDMARDs."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pharmacokinetic models that are applied to describe the disposition of therapeutic antibodies assume that the interaction between an antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. However, an increasing number of therapeutic antibodies are directed towards soluble/mobile targets. A flawed conclusion can be reached if the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis assumes that the interaction between the therapeutic antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of local versus systemic interactions between adalimumab and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), identify localization of the site of adalimumab action and assess the efficacy of local (intra-articular) versus systemic adalimumab administration for treatment of RA. METHODS: The clinical and preclinical data on adalimumab and TNF\u03b1 disposition were analysed using a pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation approach. The disposition of adalimumab and TNF\u03b1 and the interaction between them at the individual compartments (the synovial fluid of the affected joints, central and peripheral compartments) following different routes of adalimumab administration were studied. RESULTS: Outcomes of modelling and simulation using the pharmacokinetic model developed indicate that adalimumab can efficiently permeate from the diseased joints to the central circulation in RA patients. Permeability of TNF\u03b1, which is excessively secreted in the joints, is even higher than that of adalimumab. As a result, subcutaneous, intravenous and intra-articular administration of the clinically used dose of adalimumab (40 mg) exert similar effects on the time course of TNF\u03b1 concentrations at different locations in the body and efficiently deplete the TNF\u03b1 in all of the compartments for a prolonged period of time (8-10 weeks). At this dose, adalimumab exhibits predominantly systemic anti-TNF\u03b1 effects at the central and peripheral compartments (\u223c93% of the overall effect) and the contribution of the local effects in the rheumatic joints is \u223c7% for all of the studied routes, including the local intra-articular injections. The major pathway of TNF\u03b1 elimination from the synovial fluid (\u223c77% for subcutaneous administration, and \u223c72% for intravenous and intra-articular administration of adalimumab 40 mg) is interaction with adalimumab, which reaches the joints following local or systemic administration. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of adalimumab permeation to the synovial fluid (0.00422 L/h clearance of permeation) versus the rate of TNF\u03b1 turnover in the affected joints (1.84 pmol/h synthesis rate and 0.877 h(-1) degradation rate constant) are apparently the major parameters that determine the time course of TNF\u03b1 concentrations in the synovial fluid and the TNF\u03b1-neutralizing effects of adalimumab in RA patients. Outcomes of this study suggest that intra-articular administration of adalimumab is not preferable to subcutaneous or intravenous treatment. Local and systemic permeability, turnover and interactions between the drug and the target should be taken into account for optimization of the use of drugs acting on soluble targets (growth factors, interferons, interleukins, immunoglobulins, etc.)."

However, non-uniform efficacy, incidence of infections, and high costs are major concerns. Novel tissue-specific agents may overcome the current limitations of systemic administration, providing improved potency, and safety. We developed a bispecific antibody (BsAb), combining human arthritic joint targeting, via the synovial-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-A7 antibody, and TNF\u03b1 neutralization, via the scFv-anti-TNF\u03b1 of adalimumab, with the binding/blocking capacity comparable to adalimumab -immunoglobulin G (IgG). Tissue-targeting capacity of the BsAb was confirmed on the human arthritic synovium in vitro and in a synovium xenograft Severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mouse model. Peak graft accumulation occurred at 48 h after injection with sustained levels over adalimumab-IgG for 7 days and increased therapeutic effect, efficiently decreasing tissue cellularity, and markers of inflammation with higher potency compared to the standard treatment. This study provides the first description of a BsAb capable of drug delivery, specifically to the disease tissue, and a strong evidence of improved therapeutic effect on the human arthritic synovium, with applications to other existing biologics."

                "abstract": "Etanercept is a widespread biological drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which inhibits tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Recently, the presence of antibodies targeting TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors such as infliximab and adalimumab, was reported. However, few reports have studied etanercept in a mouse model of arthritis. We investigated the induction of anti-etanercept antibody production, along with the antibody's potential interfering effects on the biological function of etanercept, in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA mice received an intraperitoneal injection of etanercept (25, 100 or 400 \u00b5g per mouse). The degree of inflammation and cartilage erosion was evaluated, and the number of osteoclasts in the ankle joints was assessed by TRAP staining. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum was measured. To analyze the anti-osteoporotic effect of etanercept, microfocal computed tomography analyses of femurs and tibias were performed. Etanercept treatment decreased both the incidence and severity of arthritis in a dose-dependent manner, except for the highest dose of 400 \u00b5g. The mice that were treated with 25 and 100 \u00b5g etanercept showed an improvement in inflammation, cartilage damage, and even bone loss. However, mice treated with 400 \u00b5g etanercept showed no significant improvement in any of the tested parameters. Using a customized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the presence of the anti-etanercept antibody was detected in the serum in this treatment-refractory group. The therapeutic effect of etanercept was reduced in the CIA mice that developed the anti-etanercept antibody. In conclusion, the production of an anti-etanercept antibody can be induced in CIA mice, and this antibody can considerably reduce the anti-arthritic and anti-osteoporotic effects of etanercept."

CNI-1493 was injected daily intraperitoneally either before the onset of arthritis or after the establishment of clinical disease. Prophylactic treatment with CNI-1493 significantly prevented or delayed the onset and suppressed the severity of arthritis in a dose-dependent manner. Therapeutic intervention with CNI-1493 in established joint disease also resulted in a significant reduction of clinical signs of arthritis in treated animals. No severe side-effects were noted when animals were treated with daily CNI-1493 doses up to 5 mg/kg. An immunohistochemical study was performed which demonstrated that CNI-1493 led to a reduced expression of TNF-alpha at the site of disease activity. Thus, CNI-1493 with documented inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha synthesis, has proven successful in ameliorating the course of arthritis in CIA. We believe that the use of a compound such as CNI-1493 with a defined mode of action provides a useful tool for dissecting and understanding important pathogenic mechanisms operating in the development of chronic arthritis."

It has been long used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cough with dyspnea, spontaneous sweating, night sweating, chronic diarrhea, and neurasthenia. As a woody liana growing in mountain jungles at the altitudes of 750-1800m, it is mainly distributed in Sichuan and Hubei Provinces of China. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antiarthritic activity of acetate (EA) and n-butanol (Bu) fractions of SGD extract on a collagen-induced arthritis mice model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute toxicity of EA and Bu fractions of SGD extract was evaluated by gavage on normal mice. Pharmacological investigations were conducted on arthritis male Balb/c mice. The animal model was induced by immunization with type II bovine collagen (CII) on the 1st and the 14th day of the experimental schedule. EA fraction (104, 312, 936mg/kg), Bu fraction (156, 469, 1407mg/kg) of SGD extract was orally administered every two days since the 15th day for 3 weeks. Progression of edema in the paws was measured using a vernier caliper every 3 days since the 10th day. At the end of the experiment, the spleen index and histological changes of the hind knee joints were investigated. Additionally, to explore the possible antirheumatic mechanisms of the EA and Bu fractions, ELISA was carried out to analyze TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in the serum. RESULTS: The half lethal doses of both EA and Bu fractions were much higher than the dose administered in the pharmacological investigations. Oral administration of EA fraction and Bu fraction of SGD extract significantly and does-dependently inhibited type \u0406\u0406 collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, as indicated by the effects on paws swelling and spleen index. Histopathological examinations demonstrated that SGD effectively protected the bones and cartilages of knee joints from erosion, lesion and deformation. Besides, the serum concentrations of cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were significantly lower than the ones from the vehicle control group. Respectively, while cytokine IL-10 was remarkably higher compare with the vehicle control group. CONCLUSIONS: SGD might be a safe and effective candidate for the treatment of RA, and deserves further investigation on the chemical components in both EA and Bu fractions of SGD extract."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and IL-1 beta in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), immediately after onset and during the phase of established arthritis. METHODS: Male DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis were treated with antibodies against murine TNF alpha and IL-1 alpha/beta at different time points of the disease. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was administered using Alzet osmotic minipumps. The effect of anticytokine treatment was monitored by visual scoring. Histology and cytokine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Anti-TNF alpha treatment showed efficacy shortly after onset of the disease, but had little effect on fully established CIA. Histologic analysis after early treatment revealed that anti-TNF alpha significantly reduced joint pathology, as determined by infiltration of inflammatory cells and cartilage damage. Anti-IL-1 alpha/beta treatment ameliorated both early and full-blown CIA. This clear suppression of established arthritis was confirmed by administration of high doses of IL-1Ra. Dose-response experiments showed that a continuous supply of 1 mg/day was needed for optimal suppression. Histologic analysis showed markedly reduced cartilage destruction both in the knee and the ankle joints. Autoradiography demonstrated full recovery of chondrocyte synthetic function of articular cartilage. In addition, we found that the IL-1 beta isoform plays a dominant role in established CIA. Profound suppression of CIA was observed with anti-IL-1 beta, although elimination of both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta still gave better protection. Analysis of messenger RNA with RT-PCR revealed that IL-1 beta was highly upregulated in synovium and cartilage at late stages of CIA, whereas anti-IL-1 beta treatment markedly reduced IL-1 beta message in the synovium. CONCLUSION: The present study identified different TNF alpha/IL-1 dependencies in various stages of CIA and revealed that blocking of TNF alpha does not necessarily eliminate IL-1. Continuous, high doses of IL-1Ra are needed to block CIA."

A novel BsAb targeting TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL10 was generated by conjugating a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of the anti-CXCL10 monoclonal antibody to the Fc region of adalimumab (ADA). The effects of the BsAb on the inflammatory response in the in vitro and in vivo development of arthritis and joint destruction were evaluated in human TNF transgenic (hTNF-Tg) mice, and K/BxN serum transfer arthritis models. The BsAb inhibited CXCL10-mediated CD8+ T cell migration. The binding affinity of the BsAb to TNF-\u03b1 was comparable to that of ADA and suppressed TNF-\u03b1 induced cell death and inhibited TNF-\u03b1 induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). The BsAb decreased the expression of TNFSF11 and the production of IL-6 in RA-FLS cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL10. Treatment with the BsAb attenuated the development of arthritis in hTNF-Tg mice and suppressed LPS-induced bone erosion. In the K/BxN serum transfer model, BsAb effectively attenuated ankle swelling, synovial inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone destruction, reducing the activation of osteoclasts. The additional neutralization of TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL10 from treatment with the novel BsAb was more effective than TNF-\u03b1 inhibition alone in the in vitro and in vivo models of RA. Thus, the BsAb, targeting both TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL10, may provide a new therapeutic opportunity for RA patients who fail to respond to the blockade of a single cytokine."

The purpose of this in vivo study was to identify a methodology to enable effective quantification of antibody-type reagents in normal and inflamed tissue by investigating the distribution of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab, in healthy and inflamed murine tissue using a novel non-invasive biofluorescence method. Certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab were labeled with the low molecular weight dye alexa680. The agents were administered intravenously at a dose of 2mg/kg in na\u00efve DBA/1 mice and in DBA/1 mice with ongoing collagen-induced arthritis. Concentrations of the TNF inhibitors in the hind paws were measured using a Xenogen IVIS200 biofluorescence imager at multiple time points up to 26h post-administration. In 2 independent experiments, the distribution of certolizumab pegol was compared with that of adalimumab and infliximab. Certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab all distributed more effectively into inflamed tissue than non-inflamed tissue in this animal model of arthritis. However, the ratio of penetration of certolizumab pegol into inflamed arthritic paws compared with normal tissue was greater than that observed with adalimumab and infliximab. Furthermore, the duration of exposure in the inflamed versus normal tissue was more prolonged for certolizumab pegol than for both adalimumab and infliximab, and the accumulation of certolizumab pegol in diseased tissue was more responsive to the severity of inflammation when compared with adalimumab and infliximab. It is probable that these features of certolizumab pegol are conferred on the molecule by PEGylation. It is important to assess exposure to drug at the site of inflammation, because distinct structural features of certain agents may affect efficacy, tolerability, rapidity and/or sustainability of effect. The novel non-invasive biofluorescence method used in this study is an effective tool for comparing tissue penetration of therapeutic agents."

Because different proteases are highly up-regulated in RA and contribute significantly to joint destruction, in the present study we investigated whether such enzymes are suitable in vivo imaging biomarkers for early evaluation of treatment response in a murine model of RA. METHODS: Using a protease-activated near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging \"smart\" probe, we examined the presence and distribution of fluorescence in arthritic joints of mice with collagen-induced arthritis by both noninvasive fluorescence imaging and histology. Proteases that target the Lys-Lys cleavage site, including cathepsin B, activate probe fluorescence. Treatment monitoring data were obtained following methotrexate (MTX) therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after intravenous injection of the protease sensor, affected toes and paws of arthritic mice showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than did toes and paws of healthy mice. Fluorescence from the protease probe and cathepsin B antibody histologic staining were localized in the vast majority of cells in the inflamed synovium. In arthritic animals treated with MTX (35 mg of MTX/kg 48 hours prior to probe injection), a significantly lower fluorescent signal (inflamed paws 50%, inflamed toes 70%) was observed as compared with untreated arthritic animals. CONCLUSION: Protease-activated NIRF probes are sensitive means of imaging the presence of target enzymes in arthritic joints and can be used for early monitoring of treatment response to antirheumatic drugs such as MTX."

Kinsenoside is an essential and active compound of A. formosanus (Orchidaceae). However, the anti-arthritic activity of kinsenoside has still not been demonstrated. In the present study, we confirmed that the kinsenoside treatment rheumatoid arthritis induced by collagen-induced arthritis in mice. METHODS: Male DBA/1 J mice were immunized by intradermal injection of 100 \u03bcg of type II collagen in CFA. Kinsenoside was administered orally at a dose of 100 and 300 mg/kg once a day after 2nd booster injection. Paw swelling, arthritic score and histological change were measured. ELISA was used to measure cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in the splenocyte according to the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: Compared with model group, kinsenoside significantly inhibited paw edema and decreased the arthritis score and disease incidence. Histopathological examination demonstrated that kinsenoside effectively protected bone and cartilage of knee joint from erosion, lesion and deformation versus those from the CIA group. Kinsenoside also decreased IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP-9 expression, and increased the expression of IL-10 in inflamed joints. The administration of kinsenoside significantly suppressed levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17, but increased concentrations of IL-10 in the supernatants of each of the splenocytes in CIA mice compared with that in the H2O-treated mice with CIA. Using flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrated that kinsenoside increases the population of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells, thereby inhibiting the Th1 cell and B cell populations. Anticollagen IgG1 and IgG2a levels decreased in the serum of kinsenoside-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the administration of kinsenoside effectively suppressed inflammatory mediators' production and bone erosion in mice with collagen-induced arthritis showing the potential as an anti-arthritis agent."

We undertook this study to compare the effects of the WP9QY peptide on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice with those of anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody. METHODS: CIA was induced by primary and secondary immunizations. Osmotic minipumps were implanted in the backs of all mice on the day of the booster injection (day 21), and vehicle, anti-TNF antibody (4 mg/kg/day), or WP9QY peptide (2 mg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day) was continuously infused until the mice were killed (day 40). Thereafter, clinical, radiographic, and histologic assessments were performed. RESULTS: WP9QY treatment inhibited CIA-induced increases in the arthritis score, but onset of disease was not delayed by the peptide. The inhibitory effect of WP9QY on inflammation was definitely weaker than that of anti-TNF antibody. Microfocal computed tomography analyses, however, revealed that WP9QY blocked CIA-induced bone destruction at the knee joints to the same extent as did anti-TNF antibody. In addition, WP9QY inhibited synovial pannus infiltration and reduced osteoclast number. Furthermore, inhibition of CIA-induced systemic bone loss by WP9QY was more apparent than that by anti-TNF antibody. CONCLUSION: The TNFalpha antagonist WP9QY would be a useful template for the development of small molecular inhibitors to prevent both inflammatory bone destruction and systemic bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis."

Cytokine and chemokine levels were measured, and neutrophil infiltration into inflamed joints was quantitated. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed to measure protein nitrosylation. Chondrocyte apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. RESULTS: Macroscopic clinical evidence of CIA first appeared as periarticular erythema and edema in the hind paws. The incidence of CIA was 100% by day 27 in the CII-challenged mice, and the severity of CIA progressed over a 35-day period, with radiographic evaluation revealing focal resorption of bone. Histopathologic features of CIA included erosion of the cartilage at the joint margins. Treatment with EPO starting at the onset of arthritis (day 25) ameliorated the clinical signs on days 26-35 and improved histologic status in the joints and paws. The degree of oxidative and nitrosative damage was significantly reduced in EPO-treated mice as indicated by decreased nitrotyrosine formation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. Plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha were also significantly reduced by EPO treatment. In addition, EPO reduced the levels of apoptosis in chondrocytes in articular cartilage, as indicated by decreased TUNEL staining. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that EPO exerts an antiinflammatory effect during chronic inflammation and is able to ameliorate the tissue damage associated with CIA."

                "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can cause growth disturbances of the lower jaw (mandible). The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) juvenile rat model may be an appropriate model for studying how juvenile arthritis affects this joint during growth. However, studies using this animal model to investigate TMJ arthritis are limited. To validate an animal model for studying TMJ arthritis in growing rats, our study aimed to investigate the changes in mandibular growth and expression of proteins and cytokines in the mandibular condyle of CIA juvenile rat TMJs. A total of 27 male Wistar rats (3 weeks old) were scanned with microcomputed tomography (MicroCT) and divided into three groups (n\u2009=\u20099); CIA was induced in each TMJ in the CIA group, the Saline group received saline injections (sham injections) into their TMJs, and the Healthy group remained untreated (no TMJ injections) as negative controls. After 4 weeks, our results show that mandibular growth was significantly reduced in the CIA group compared with the Saline group (p\u2009<\u20090.01). There was no difference in mandibular growth between the two control groups (Saline and Healthy). Inflamed synovial tissue, cartilage invaginations, and lipid accumulation were observed in the CIA TMJs. Toluidine blue staining revealed decreased proteoglycan production in the CIA cartilage. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that type II collagen expression decreased, interleukin-1\u03b2 expression increased, and matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression increased in the CIA TMJs in comparison with the two control groups (Saline and Healthy). Immunostaining of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was quantified and we showed that TNF-\u03b1 expression was significantly greater in the CIA cartilage compared with both control groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and there was no difference in TNF-\u03b1 expression between the Saline and Healthy groups. This CIA juvenile rat model of TMJ juvenile arthritis shows that CIA reduced mandibular growth and induced degenerative changes in TMJ condylar cartilage. This new information will help to understand the pathogenesis involved in CIA in juvenile rat TMJs for this animal model to be used in research investigating new therapeutics to treat TMJ juvenile arthritis. Impact statement In this study, the effects of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) using a juvenile rat model were investigated. Our results showed that local injection of CIA in the TMJ significantly reduced mandibular growth and caused degenerative changes in condylar cartilage. This information helps to validate this animal model for studying the effect of arthritis in TMJs in growing rats. This model has the potential to be used in future studies to evaluate possible therapies for TMJ arthritis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of M40403, a synthetic mimetic of superoxide dismutase (SOD), on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. METHODS: CIA was elicited in Lewis rats by intradermal injection of 100 microl of an emulsion of bovine type II collagen (CII) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at the base of the tail. A second injection was given on day 21. RESULTS: Immunization induced an erosive arthritis of the hind paws. Macroscopic evidence of CIA first appeared as periarticular erythema and edema in the hind paws by days 24-26 after the first injection, with a 100% incidence by days 27. Severity progressed over a 35-day period. Radiography revealed soft tissue swelling and focal resorption of bone, together with osteophyte formation in the tibiotarsal joint. Histopathologic features included erosion of the articular cartilage at the joint margins and subchondral bone resorption associated with bone-derived multinucleated cell-containing granulomatous lesions. Treatment with M40403 (2-10 mg/kg/day) starting at the onset of arthritis (day 25) ameliorated the clinical signs on days 26-35 and improved the histologic findings in the joint and paw. Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine (a marker of peroxynitrite formation) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; a nuclear enzyme activated by DNA single-strand damage) revealed positive staining in the inflamed joints of CII-treated rats, suggestive of the formation of peroxynitrite and DNA damage, both of which were markedly reduced by M40403 treatment. Radiographic evidence of protection from bone resorption, osteophyte formation, and soft tissue swelling was apparent in the tibiotarsal joints of M40403-treated rats. Arthritic rats treated with M40403 gained weight at the same rate and to the same extent as normal, nonarthritic rats. CONCLUSION: This study shows that a low molecular weight mimetic of SOD, M40403, attenuates the degree of chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and bone damage associated with CIA in the rat, and supports the possible use of SOD mimetics as therapeutic agents for the management of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis associated with high concentrations of pro-inflammatory, cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Adalimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds TNF-\u03b1, and is widely used to treat RA. Despite its proven clinical efficacy, adalimumab and other therapeutic mAbs have disadvantages, including the requirement for repeated bolus injections and the appearance of treatment limiting anti-drug antibodies. To address these issues, we have developed an innovative ex vivo gene therapy approach, termed transduced autologous restorative gene therapy (TARGT), to produce and secrete adalimumab for the treatment of RA. METHODS: Helper-dependent (HD) adenovirus vector containing adalimumab light and heavy chain coding sequences was used to transduce microdermal tissues and cells of human and mouse origin ex vivo, rendering sustained secretion of active adalimumab. The genetically engineered tissues were subsequently implanted in a mouse model of RA. RESULTS: Transduced human microdermal tissues implanted in SCID mice demonstrated 49\u00a0days of secretion of active adalimumab in the blood, at levels of tens of microgram per milliliter. In addition, transduced autologous dermal cells were implanted in the RA mouse model and demonstrated statistically significant amelioration in RA symptoms compared to na\u00efve cell implantation and were similar to recombinant adalimumab bolus injections. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study report microdermal tissues engineered to secrete active adalimumab as a proof of concept for sustained secretion of antibody from the novel ex vivo gene therapy TARGT platform. This technology may now be applied to a range of antibodies for the therapy of other diseases."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic strategies to block tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) activity in experimental autoimmune arthritis models and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have proved highly successful, and provide sustained beneficial effects. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether TNFalpha inhibition has immunological activity beyond the reduction of inflammation in collagen induced arthritis (CIA), an established experimental model of RA. METHODS: Arthritic DBA/1 mice received single periarticular injections of retroviral constructs encoding human TNF receptor (TNF-R) into the affected arthritic paw, at the onset of arthritis. Severity of arthritis, antibodies to collagen type II (CII), and extent of pathological joint damage of arthritic paws were compared between TNF-R and media treated (control) animals 3, 7, 14, 21, and 49 days after disease onset. RESULTS: Severity of CIA was significantly decreased in TNF-R treated animals compared with controls, 14-34 days after disease onset. Joint destruction was reduced in TNF-R injected joints and in the uninjected contralateral and ipsilateral paws of TNF-R treated animals. Seven days after disease onset, TNF-R treated mice had lower levels of inflammatory Th1 driven IgG2a antibodies to CII (p<0.05) than controls. This altered the anticollagen IgG2a:IgG1 ratio towards Th2 driven IgG1. CONCLUSIONS: Local TNF-R gene therapy in CIA appears to have systemic effects on the anti-CII antibodies. The overall influence of TNF-R gene therapy is that it inhibits the progression of CIA mainly by suppressing the inflammatory Th1 response rather than by stimulating a Th2 response. Therefore, periarticular TNF-R gene therapy may have excellent therapeutic potential in RA."

                "title": "Protection against cartilage and bone destruction by systemic interleukin-4 treatment in established murine type II collagen-induced arthritis.",
                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased production of a range of cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1, which display potent proinflammatory actions that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Although TNF-alpha seems to be the major cytokine in the inflammatory process, IL-1 is the key mediator with regard to cartilage and bone destruction. Apart from direct blockage of IL-1/TNF, regulation can be exerted at the level of modulatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-10. IL-4 is a pleiotropic T-cell derived cytokine that can exert either suppressive or stimulatory effects on different cell types, and was originally identified as a B-cell growth factor and regulator of humoral immune pathways. IL-4 is produced by activated CD4+T cells and it promotes the maturation of TH2 cells. IL-4 stimulates proliferation, differentiation and activation of several cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. IL-4 is also known to be a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 by macrophages and monocytes. Moreover, IL-4 stimulates the synthesis of several cytokine inhibitors such as interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), soluble IL-1-receptor type II and TNF receptors IL-4 suppresses metalloproteinase production and stimulates tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 production in human mononuclear phagocytes and cartilage explants, indicating a protective effect of IL-4 towards extracellular matrix degradation. Furthermore, IL-4 inhibits both osteoclast activity and survival, and thereby blocks bone resorption in vitro. Of great importance is that IL-4 could not be detected in synovial fluid or in tissues. This absence of IL-4 in the joint probably contributes to the disturbance in the Th1/Th2 balance in chronic RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used model of arthritis that displays several features of human RA. Recently it was demonstrated that the onset of CIA is under stringent control of IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that exposure to IL-4 during the immunization stage reduced onset and severity of CIA. However, after cessation of IL-4 treatment disease expression increased to control values. AIMS: Because it was reported that IL-4 suppresses several proinflammatory cytokines and matrix degrading enzymes and upregulates inhibitors of both cytokines and catabolic enzymes, we investigated the tissue protective effect of systemic IL-4 treatment using established murine CIA as a model. Potential synergy of low dosages of anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids and IL-4 was also evaluated. METHODS: DBA-1J/Bom mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen and boosted at day 21. Mice with established CIA were selected at day 28 after immunization and treated for days with IL-4, prednisolone, or combinations of prednisolone and IL-4. Arthritis score was monitored visually. Joint pathology was evaluated by histology, radiology and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). In addition, serum levels of IL-1Ra and anticollagen antibodies were determined. RESULTS: Treatment of established CIA with IL-4 (1microgram/day) resulted in suppression of disease activity as depicted in Figure 1. Of great interest is that, although 1 microgram/day IL-4 had only a moderate effect on the inflammatory component of the disease activity, it strongly reduced cartilage pathology, as determined by histological examination (Fig. 1). Moreover, serum COMP levels were significantly reduced, confirming decreased cartilage involvement. In addition, both histological and radiological analysis showed that bone destruction was prevented (Fig. 1). Systemic IL-4 administration increased serum IL-1Ra levels and reduced anticollagen type II antibody levels. Treatment with low-dose IL-4 (0.1 microgram/day) was ineffective in suppressing disease score, serum COMP or joint destruction. Synergistic suppression of both arthritis severity and COMP levels was noted when low-dose IL-4 was combined with prednisolone (0.05 mg/kg/day), however, which in itself was not effective. DISCUSSION: In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic IL-4 treatment ameliorates disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression of established CIA. Although clinical disease progression was only arrested and not reversed, clear protection against cartilage and bone destruction was noted. This is in accord with findings in both human RA and animal models of RA that show that inflammation and tissue destruction sometimes are uncoupled processes. Of great importance is that, although inflammation was still present, strong reduction in serum COMP was found after exposure to IL-4. This indicated that serum COMP levels reflected cartilage damage, although a limited contribution of the inflamed synovium cannot be excluded. Increased serum IL-1Ra level (twofold) was found after systemic treatment with IL-4, but it is not likely that this could explain the suppression of CIA. We and others have reported that high dosages of IL-1Ra are needed for marked suppression of CIA. As reported previously, lower dosages of IL-4 did not reduce clinical disease severity of established CIA. Of importance is that combined treatment of low dosages of IL-4 and IL-10 appeared to have more potent anti-inflammatory effects, and markedly protected against cartilage destruction. Improved anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with IL-4/prednisolone treatment. In addition, synergistic effects were found for the reduction of cartilage and bone destruction. This indicates that systemic IL-4/prednisolone treatment may provide a cartilage and bone protective therapy for human RA."

            "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with high mortality and poor prognosis. Oncogenic transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) plays an important role in promoting HCC. A small molecule inhibitor of LSF, Factor Quinolinone Inhibitor 1 (FQI1), significantly inhibited human HCC xenografts in nude mice without harming normal cells. Here we evaluated the efficacy of FQI1 and another inhibitor, FQI2, in inhibiting endogenous hepatocarcinogenesis. HCC was induced in a transgenic mouse with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of c-myc (Alb/c-myc) by injecting N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) followed by FQI1 or FQI2 treatment after tumor development. LSF inhibitors markedly decreased tumor burden in Alb/c-myc mice with a corresponding decrease in proliferation and angiogenesis. Interestingly, in vitro treatment of human HCC cells with LSF inhibitors resulted in mitotic arrest with an accompanying increase in CyclinB1. Inhibition of CyclinB1 induction by Cycloheximide or CDK1 activity by Roscovitine significantly prevented FQI-induced mitotic arrest. A significant induction of apoptosis was also observed upon treatment with FQI. These effects of LSF inhibition, mitotic arrest and induction of apoptosis by FQI1s provide multiple avenues by which these inhibitors eliminate HCC cells. LSF inhibitors might be highly potent and effective therapeutics for HCC either alone or in combination with currently existing therapies. "

                "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Despite the prevalence of HCC, there is no effective, systemic treatment. The transcription factor LSF is a promising protein target for chemotherapy; it is highly expressed in HCC patient samples and cell lines, and promotes oncogenesis in rodent xenograft models of HCC. Here, we identify small molecules that effectively inhibit LSF cellular activity. The lead compound, factor quinolinone inhibitor 1 (FQI1), inhibits LSF DNA-binding activity both in vitro, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and in cells, as determined by ChIP. Consistent with such inhibition, FQI1 eliminates transcriptional stimulation of LSF-dependent reporter constructs. FQI1 also exhibits antiproliferative activity in multiple cell lines. In LSF-overexpressing cells, including HCC cells, cell death is rapidly induced; however, primary or immortalized hepatocytes are unaffected by treatment with FQI1. The highly concordant structure-activity relationship of a panel of 23 quinolinones strongly suggests that the growth inhibitory activity is due to a single biological target or family. Coupled with the striking agreement between the concentrations required for antiproliferative activity (GI(50)s) and for inhibition of LSF transactivation (IC(50)s), we conclude that LSF is the specific biological target of FQIs. Based on these in vitro results, we tested the efficacy of FQI1 in inhibiting HCC tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. As a single agent, tumor growth was dramatically inhibited with no observable general tissue cytotoxicity. These findings support the further development of LSF inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy."

                "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common cancer worldwide. It is intrinsically resistant toward standard chemotherapy, making it imperative to develop novel selective chemotherapeutic agents. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays critical roles in development and oncogenesis, and is dysregulated in HCC. Our study aims to evaluate the activity of 3 small molecule antagonists of the Tcf4/beta-catenin complex (PKF118-310, PKF115-584 and CGP049090) on HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. All 3 chemicals displayed dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro against all 3 HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep40 and Huh7), but were at least 10 times less cytotoxic to normal hepatocytes (from 3 donors) by using ATP assay. In HepG2 and Huh7 cells, treatment with the antagonists decreased Tcf4/beta-catenin binding capability and transcriptional activity, associated with downregulation of the endogenous Tcf4/ beta-catenin target genes c-Myc, cyclin D1 and survivin. In HepG2 and Huh7 cells, treatment with the antagonists induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. All antagonists suppressed in vivo tumor growth in a HepG2 xenograft model, associated with apoptosis and reduced c-Myc, cyclin D1 and survivin expressions. Our results suggest that these 3 antagonists of the Tcf4/beta-catenin complex are potential chemotherapeutic agents which may offer a pathway specific option for the clinical management of HCC."

                "title": "The transcription factor LSF: a novel oncogene for hepatocellular carcinoma.",
                "abstract": "The transcription factor LSF (Late SV40 Factor), also known as TFCP2, belongs to the LSF/CP2 family related to Grainyhead family of proteins and is involved in many biological events, including regulation of cellular and viral promoters, cell cycle, DNA synthesis, cell survival and Alzheimer's disease. Our recent studies establish an oncogenic role of LSF in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LSF overexpression is detected in human HCC cell lines and in more than 90% cases of human HCC patients, compared to normal hepatocytes and liver, and its expression level showed significant correlation with the stages and grades of the disease. Forced overexpression of LSF in less aggressive HCC cells resulted in highly aggressive, angiogenic and multi-organ metastatic tumors in nude mice. Conversely, inhibition of LSF significantly abrogated growth and metastasis of highly aggressive HCC cells in nude mice. Microarray studies revealed that as a transcription factor LSF modulated specific genes regulating invasion, angiogenesis, chemoresistance and senescence. LSF transcriptionally regulates thymidylate synthase (TS) gene, thus contributing to cell cycle regulation and chemoresistance. Our studies identify a network of proteins, including osteopontin (OPN), Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), c-Met and complement factor H (CFH), that are directly regulated by LSF and play important role in LSF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. A high throughput screening identified small molecule inhibitors of LSF DNA binding and the prototype of these molecules, Factor Quinolinone inhibitor 1 (FQI1), profoundly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in human HCC cells without exerting harmful effects to normal immortal human hepatocytes and primary mouse hepatocytes. In nude mice xenograft studies, FQI1 markedly inhibited growth of human HCC xenografts as well as angiogenesis without exerting any toxicity. These studies establish a key role of LSF in hepatocarcinogenesis and usher in a novel therapeutic avenue for HCC, an invariably fatal disease."

Herein we report \u03c8-Bufarenogin, a novel active compound that we isolated from the extract of toad skin, exhibited potent therapeutic effect in xenografted human hepatoma without notable side effects. In vitro, \u03c8-Bufarenogin suppressed HCC cells proliferation through impeding cell cycle progression, and it facilitated cell apoptosis by downregulating Mcl-1 expression. Moreover, \u03c8-Bufarenogin decreased the number of hepatoma stem cells through Sox2 depression and exhibited synergistic effect with conventional chemotherapeutics. Mechanistic study revealed that \u03c8-Bufarenogin impaired the activation of MEK/ERK pathway, which is essential in the proliferation of hepatoma cells. \u03c8-Bufarenogin notably suppressed PI3-K/Akt cascade, which was required in \u03c8-Bufarenogin-mediated reduction of Mcl-1 and Sox2. \u03c8-Bufarenogin inhibited the auto-phosphorylation and activation of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), thereafter suppressed their primary downstream cascades Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3-K/Akt signaling. Taken together, \u03c8-Bufarenogin suppressed HCC growth via inhibiting, at least partially, receptor tyrosine kinases-regulated signaling, suggesting that \u03c8-Bufarenogin could be a novel lead compound for anti-HCC drug.

                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis due to a lack of effective treatment options. In HCC a significant role is played by DNA damage and the inflammatory response. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is an important protein that regulates both these mechanisms. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of pharmacology PARP-1 inhibition on the reduction of tumor volume of HCC xenograft and on the hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN). Pharmacologic PARP-1 inhibition with DPQ greatly reduces tumor xenograft volume with regard to a nontreated xenograft (394 mm(3) versus 2,942 mm(3), P < 0.05). This observation was paralleled by reductions in xenograft mitosis (P = 0.02) and tumor vasculogenesis (P = 0.007, confirmed by in vitro angiogenesis study), as well as by an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in DPQ-treated mice (P = 0.04). A substantial difference in key tumor-related gene expression (transformed 3T3 cell double minute 2 [MDM2], FLT1 [vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, VEGFR1], epidermal growth factor receptor [EPAS1]/hypoxia-inducible factor 2 [HIF2A], EGLN1 [PHD2], epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], MYC, JUND, SPP1 [OPN], hepatocyte growth factor [HGF]) was found between the control tumor xenografts and the PARP inhibitor-treated xenografts (data confirmed in HCC cell lines using PARP inhibitors and PARP-1 small interfering RNA [siRNA]). Furthermore, the results obtained in mice treated with DEN to induce hepatocarcinogenesis showed, after treatment with a PARP inhibitor (DPQ), a significant reduction both in preneoplastic foci and in the expression of preneoplastic markers and proinflammatory genes (Gstm3, Vegf, Spp1 [Opn], IL6, IL1b, and Tnf), bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and NF-kappaB activation in the initial steps of carcinogenesis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study shows that PARP inhibition is capable of controlling HCC growth and preventing tumor vasculogenesis by regulating the activation of different genes involved in tumor progression."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE OF STUDY: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death. Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have refractory disease. The purpose of this study is to assess the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities of foretinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and c-Met inhibitor using mouse models of human HCC. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES: SK-HEP1 and 21-0208 HCC cells as well as patient-derived HCC models were employed to study the anti-tumor and antiangiogenic activities of foretinib. Changes of biomarkers relevant to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling pathways were determined by Western blotting. Microvessel density, apoptosis and cell proliferation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Treatment of SK-HEP1 cells with foretinib resulted in growth inhibition, G2/M cell cycle arrest, reduced colony formation and blockade of HGF-induced cell migration. In both orthotopic and ectopic models of HCC, foretinib potently inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of angiogenesis correlated with inactivation of VEGFR-2/c-Met signaling pathways. Foretinib also caused elevation of p27 and Bim but reduced cyclin B1 expression and p-c-Myc, which resulted in a reduction in cellular proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. In an orthotopic model, foretinib potently inhibited primary tumor growth and significantly prolonged mouse survival. DATA INTERPRETATIONS: Foretinib demonstrated significant antitumor activities in patient-derived HCC xenograft models. This study provides a compelling rationale for clinical investigation in patients with advanced HCC."

                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist have been shown to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, the role of PPARgamma in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of PPARgamma against HCC. PPARgamma-deficient (PPARgamma(+/-)) and wild-type (PPARgamma(+/+)) littermates were used in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model and treated with PPARgamma agonist (rosiglitazone) or the vehicle alone for 8 months. The effects of PPARgamma on HCC cell growth and apoptosis were examined using PPARgamma-expressing adenovirus (Ad-PPARgamma). PPARgamma(+/-) mice were more susceptible to DEN-induced HCC than PPARgamma(+/+) mice (94% versus 62%, P < 0.05), and rosiglitazone significantly reduced the incidence of HCC in PPARgamma(+/+) mice (vehicle 62% versus treatment 24%, P < 0.01), but not in PPARgamma(+/-) mice, indicating that PPARgamma suppresses hepatocellular carcinogenesis. A pronounced expression of PPARgamma was observed in a HCC cell line (Hep3B) infected with Ad-PPARgamma. Such induction markedly suppressed HCC cell viability (P < 0.01). Further, Hep3B infection with Ad-PPARgamma revealed a decreased proportion of cells in S-phase (12.92% versus 11.58%, P < 0.05), with arrest at G(2)/M phase (38.2% versus 55.68%, P < 0.001), and there was concomitant phosphorylation of the key G(2)/M phase inhibitors cdc25C and cdc2. PPARgamma overexpression increased cell apoptosis (21.47% versus 35.02%, P < 0.01), mediated by both extrinsic (Fas and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and intrinsic (caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7, and poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) pathways. Moreover, PPARgamma directly induced a putative tumor suppressor gene, growth differentiation factor-15. CONCLUSION: Loss of one PPARgamma allele is sufficient to enhance susceptibility to HCC. PPARgamma suppresses tumor cell growth through reducing cell proliferation and inducing G(2)/M phase arrest, apoptosis, and up-regulating growth differentiation factor-15. Thus, PPARgamma acts as a tumor-suppressor gene in the liver."

                "abstract": "Smad7 is a principal inhibitor of the TGF\u03b2-Smad signalling pathway. We have investigated the functional significance of Smad7 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Smad7 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce HCC. The effects of Smad7 on cellular features were examined in HCC cells, using a Smad7 over-expression or deletion approach. Signalling pathway components modulated by Smad7 in HCC were evaluated using luciferase reporter assay and co-immunoprecipitation. Smad7 was down-regulated in human HCCs compared with the adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.001). Smad7 KO mice were more susceptible to DEN-induced HCC than WT mice (78% versus 22%, p < 0.05). HCCs from KO mice displayed a greater proliferation activity (p < 0.05) and a reduced apoptotic index compared with WT littermates (p < 0.05). Deletion of Smad7 promoted cell proliferation in primary cultured HCC cells. In addition, over-expression of Smad7 in HCC cell lines markedly suppressed cell growth (p < 0.0001) and colony formation (p < 0.01). Cell cycle analysis revealed an increase in the G1 phase and a reduction in the S-phase populations, accompanied by up-regulation of p27(Kip1) and down-regulation of cyclin D1. Smad7 increased cell apoptosis (p < 0.01) by mediating an intrinsic [caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] apoptotic pathway. Moreover, Smad7 inhibited NF-\u03baB signalling by interacting with TAB2, an upstream activator of NF-\u03baB, and inhibited TGF\u03b2 signalling by suppressing phosphorylation of Smad3. In conclusion, loss of Smad7 enhances susceptibility to HCC. Smad7 suppresses HCC cell growth by inhibiting proliferation and G1 -S phase transition and inducing apoptosis through attenuation of NF-\u03baB and TGF\u03b2 signalling. Smad7 acts as a potential tumour suppressor in liver."

                "abstract": "Regulatory factor X-1 (RFX-1) is a transcription factor that has been linked to negative regulation of tumor progression; however, its biological function and signaling cascades are unknown. Here, we performed several studies to elucidate the roles of RFX-1 in the regulation of SHP-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Overexpression of RFX-1 resulted in the activation of SHP-1 and repressed colony formation of HCC cells. In addition, by a mouse xenograft model, we demonstrated that RFX-1 overexpression also inhibited the tumor growth of HCC cells in vivo, suggesting that RFX-1 is of potential interest for small-molecule-targeted therapy. We also found that SC-2001, a bipyrrole molecule, induced apoptosis in HCC cells through activating RFX-1 expression. SC-2001 induced RFX-1 translocation from the cytosol to nucleus, bound to the SHP-1 promoter, and activated SHP-1 transcription. In a xenograft model, knockdown of RFX-1 reversed the antitumor effect of SC-2001. Notably, SC-2001 is much more potent than sorafenib, a clinically approved drug for HCC, in in vitro and in vivo assays. Our study confirmed that RFX-1 acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC and might be a new target for HCC therapy. The findings of this study also provide a new lead compound for targeted therapy via the activation of the RFX-1/SHP-1 pathway. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) regulate genes involved in carcinogenesis and progression of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein (pVHL) targets HIF\u03b1 subunits for destruction and participates in modulating the activity of NF-\u03baB. The present study aimed to investigate whether the overexpression of pVHL synergizes with doxorubicin in the treatment of HCC. METHODS: Overexpression of pVHL was induced by infecting mouse HCC Hepa1-6 and H22 cells, or injecting subcutaneous Hepa1-6 tumors in C57BL/c mice, with adenoviral vectors encoding mouse VHL gene. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumoral angiogenesis, and gene expression and DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB were examined. The therapeutic effects of pVHL were also evaluated in orthotopic Hepa1-6 tumors by intraportal delivery of Ad-VHL. RESULTS: Ad-VHL enhanced the anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin by inhibiting cell proliferation, and causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The Ad-VHL infection downregulated HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 expression, and inhibited NF-\u03baB activity and the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Injection of Ad-VHL into HCC tumors augmented doxorubicin-induced suppression of tumor growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, and by inducing cell apoptosis. Effects on the expression of HIF\u03b1s, activity of NF-\u03baB, and their downstream genes were in accordance with the in vitro findings. Intraportal injection of Ad-VHL enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin to suppress the growth of orthotopic liver tumors. CONCLUSIONS: By targeting HIF and NF-\u03baB, overexpression of pVHL enhances the efficacy of doxorubicin, and warrants consideration as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HCC."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a pivotal role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies indicated that inhibition of mTORC1 enhanced histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis)-mediated anti-tumor activity, accompanied with feedback activation of AKT. Therefore, dual targeting of mTORC1/C2 should be more efficient in suppressing AKT activity and in enhancing the anti-tumor activity of HDACi in HCC. METHODS: The interactions between mTOR kinase inhibitors (mTORKis) (i.e., Pp242, AZD8055, OSI027) and HDACis (i.e., SAHA, LBH589) were examined in vitro using HCC cell lines and in vivo using patient-derived primary HCC xenografts on SCID mice. RESULTS: mTORKis significantly enhanced HDACi-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. The inhibition of both mTORC1/2 not only efficiently blocked mTORC1 signaling, but also abrogated AKT-feedback activation caused by selective mTORC1 inhibition. The co-treatment of mTORKi and HDACi further inhibited AKT signaling and upregulated Bim. Dysfunction of mTORC2 by shRNA significantly lowered the threshold of HDACi-induced cytotoxicity by abrogating AKT activation. Knockdown of AKT1 sensitized Pp242/HDACi-induced apoptosis and ectopic expression of constitutively active AKT1 abrogated the combination-induced cytotoxicity, indicating AKT plays a vital role in the combination-induced effects. Knockdown of Bim prevented Pp242/HDACis-induced cytotoxicity in HCC. Lastly, in vivo studies indicated that the combination of AZD8055 and SAHA almost completely inhibited tumor-growth, without obvious adverse effects, by abrogating AKT and upregulating Bim; while either agent alone shows only 30% inhibition in primary HCC xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a combining-regimen of mTORKi and HDACi may be an effective therapeutic strategy for HCC."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a particularly vascularized solid tumor where the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is activated; suggesting that inhibition of this pathway may have therapeutic potential. METHODS: We treated patient-derived HCC xenografts with (i) sorafenib, (ii) AZD6244 (ARRY-142886), and (iii) sorafenib plus AZD6244. Western blotting was employed to determine pharmacodynamic changes in biomarkers relevant to both angiogenesis and MEK signaling. Apoptosis, microvessel density, and cell proliferation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We report here that sorafenib treatment resulted in suppression of tumor growth, reduction in cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and inhibition of mTOR targets. Sorafenib-induced elevation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R), phospho-c-Raf Ser338, phospho-MEK Ser217/221 and phospho-ERK Thr202/Tyr204 was attenuated by co-treating cells with anti-human IGF-1R antibody or over-expression of activated mutant p70S6K. Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway by AZD6244 enhanced the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib in both orthotopic and ectopic models of HCC. Such inhibition led to a further increase in pro-apoptotic Bim, apoptosis and a profound inhibition of cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential of a combined therapeutic approach with sorafenib and MEK inhibitors in the treatment of HCC."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The oncogene LSF (encoded by TFCP2) has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target for multiple cancers. LSF overexpression in patient tumors correlates with poor prognosis in particular for both hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. The limited treatment outcomes for these diseases and disappointing clinical results, in particular, for hepatocellular carcinoma in molecularly targeted therapies targeting cellular receptors and kinases, underscore the need for molecularly targeting novel mechanisms. LSF small molecule inhibitors, Factor Quinolinone Inhibitors (FQIs), have exhibited robust anti-tumor activity in multiple pre-clinical models, with no observable toxicity. METHODS: To understand how the LSF inhibitors impact cancer cell proliferation, we characterized the cellular phenotypes that result from loss of LSF activity. Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were analyzed, using HeLa cells as a model cancer cell line responsive to FQI1. Cell cycle progression was studied either by time lapse microscopy or by bulk synchronization of cell populations to ensure accuracy in interpretation of the outcomes. In order to test for biological specificity of targeting LSF by FQI1, results were compared after treatment with either FQI1 or siRNA targeting LSF. RESULTS: Highly similar cellular phenotypes are observed upon treatments with FQI1 and siRNA targeting LSF. Along with similar effects on two cellular biomarkers, inhibition of LSF activity by either mechanism induced a strong delay or arrest prior to metaphase as cells progressed through mitosis, with condensed, but unaligned, chromosomes. This mitotic disruption in both cases resulted in improper cellular division leading to multiple outcomes: multi-nucleation, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support that cellular phenotypes observed upon FQI1 treatment are due specifically to the loss of LSF activity. Specific inhibition of LSF by either small molecules or siRNA results in severe mitotic defects, leading to cell death or senescence - consequences that are desirable in combating cancer. Taken together, these findings confirm that LSF is a promising target for cancer treatment. Furthermore, this study provides further support for developing FQIs or other LSF inhibitory strategies as treatment for LSF-related cancers with high unmet medical needs."

In this study we synthesized a novel PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor, IPD-196 [ethyl 6-(5-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonamido)pyridin-3-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxylate], and evaluated its anticancer effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. IPD-196 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream PI3K effectors such as Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1, and its antiproliferative effect was more potent than that of sorafenib or LY294002. It also induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase as well as apoptosis by increasing the proportion of sub-G1 apoptotic cells, and the levels of cleaved PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9. Furthermore, it decreased the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF in Huh-7 cells, and inhibited tube formation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was confirmed by a Matrigel plug assay in mice. Taken together, IPD-196 exhibited its anticancer activity through disruption of the PI3K/Akt pathway that caused cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of angiogenesis in human HCC cells. We therefore suggest that IPD-196 may be a potential candidate drug for targeted HCC therapy."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: STK33 has been reported to play an important role in cancer cell proliferation. We investigated the role of STK33 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its underlying mechanisms. DESIGN: 251 patients with HCC were analysed for association between STK33 expression and clinical stage and survival rate. Tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible, hepatocyte-specific STK33 transgenic and knockout mice models were used to study the role of STK33 in liver tumorigenesis. HCC cell lines were used to study the role of STK33 in cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: STK33 expression was found to be frequently upregulated in patients with HCC. Significant associations were found between increased expression of STK33 and advanced HCC staging and shorter disease-free survival of patients. Overexpression of STK33 increased HCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, whereas suppression of STK33 inhibited this effect. Using a TAM-inducible, hepatocyte-specific STK33 transgenic mouse model, we found that overexpression of STK33 resulted in increased hepatocyte proliferation, leading to tumour cell burst. Using a TAM-inducible, hepatocyte-specific STK33 knockout mouse model, we found that, when subjected to the diethylnitrosamine (DEN) liver cancer bioassay, STK33KO(flox/flox, Alb-ERT2-Cre) mice exhibited a markedly lower incidence of tumour formation compared with control mice. The underlying mechanism may be that STK33 binds directly to c-Myc and increases its transcriptional activity. In particular, the C-terminus of STK33 blocks STK33/c-Myc association, downregulates HCC cell proliferation, and reduces DEN-induced liver tumour cell number and tumour size. CONCLUSIONS: STK33 plays an essential role in hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumorigenesis. The C-terminus of STK33 could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with STK33-overexpressed HCC."

Understanding of the molecular mechanism of HCC development and progression is imperative for developing novel, effective, and targeted therapies for this lethal disease. In this article, we document that the cellular transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) plays an important role in HCC pathogenesis. LSF protein was significantly overexpressed in human HCC cells compared to normal hepatocytes. In 109 HCC patients, LSF protein was overexpressed in >90% cases, compared to normal liver, and LSF expression level showed significant correlation with the stages and grades of the disease. Forced overexpression of LSF in less aggressive HCC cells resulted in highly aggressive, angiogenic, and multiorgan metastatic tumors in nude mice. Conversely, inhibition of LSF significantly abrogated growth and metastasis of highly aggressive HCC cells in nude mice. Microarray studies revealed that as a transcription factor, LSF modulated specific genes regulating invasion, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and senescence. The expression of osteopontin (OPN), a gene regulating every step in tumor progression and metastasis, was robustly up-regulated by LSF. It was documented that LSF transcriptionally up-regulates OPN, and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that OPN plays an important role in mediating the oncogenic functions of LSF. Together, these data establish a regulatory role of LSF in cancer, particularly HCC pathogenesis, and validate LSF as a viable target for therapeutic intervention."

Sinomenine hydrochloride (SH), an anti\u2011arthritis drug applied in clinical practice, has been reported to have in vitro anti\u2011neoplastic activity in various cancer cells. Whether SH inhibits HCC remains unknown. For this purpose, in this study, MTT assay was used to determine cell growth. Flow cytometry, Hoechst staining, DNA fragmentation, western blot analysis, immunohistochemisty and TUNEL staining were performed to investigate the mechanisms involved. The in vivo activity of SH was determined using a mouse xenograft model. SH inhibited the growth of various types of human HCC cells in vitro. We found that SH promoted cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and sub\u2011G1 formation, associated with the increased p21/WAF1/Cip1 expression. Additionally, SH induced caspase\u2011dependent apoptosis, which involved the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, the increased release of cytochrome c and Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, the downregulation of Bcl\u20112 and the upregulation of Bax, the activation of a caspase cascade (caspase\u20118, -10, -9 and -3) and PARP, as well as the decreased expression of survivin. The SH\u2011suppressed growth of human HCC xenografts in vivo occurred due to the decrease in proliferation and the induction of apoptosis, implicating the activation of caspase\u20113, the upregulation of p21 and the downregulation of survivin. These findings suggest that SH exhibits anticancer efficacy in vitro and in vivo involving cell cycle and caspase\u2011dependent apoptosis and may serve as a potential drug candidate against HCC."

                "abstract": "Sorafenib is the approved systemic drug of choice for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but has demonstrated limited benefits because of drug resistance. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) has been shown to be a promising anticancer drug against various types of cancers and acts by dysregulating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1. Hypoxic cancer cells are extremely resistant to therapies since they elicit strong survival ability due to the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia, which is controlled by HIF-1 and HIF-2. The present study has demonstrated that sorafenib downregulated the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, making the hypoxic response switch from HIF-1\u03b1- to HIF-2\u03b1-dependent pathways, resulting in upregulation of HIF-2\u03b1, which contributes to the insensitivity of hypoxic HCC cells to sorafenib. HIF-2\u03b1 played a dominant role in regulating VEGF, thus sorafenib in turn increased the expression of VEGF (a downstream molecule of both HIF-1 and HIF-2) and cyclin D1 (a downstream molecule of HIF-2), but reduced the expression of LDHA (a downstream molecule of HIF-1), in hypoxic HCC cells. 2ME2 significantly reduced the expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, and their downstream molecules, VEGF, LDHA and cyclin D1, rendering hypoxic HCC cells to increased sensitivity to 2ME2. 2ME2 also inhibited the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 proteins, but had no effect on their mRNA expression. 2M2 synergized with sorafenib to suppress the proliferation and induction of apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited tumoral angiogenesis. These results indicate that 2ME2 given in combination with sorafenib acts synergistically for treating HCC. "

Therefore, in this study, the efficacy and inhibitory mechanisms of nicotinamide against HCC were investigated in mice and HCC cell lines, respectively. To evaluate the inhibitory effects of nicotinamide on HCC development, mice were injected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and simultaneously treated with 1% nicotinamide. Also, the effect of nicotinamide on human HCC cell lines was assessed by measuring caspase activity, cell proliferation, and DNA content using immunoblot analysis and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. It was found that nicotinamide significantly inhibited the development of pre-neoplastic lesions (foci and adenomas) during the early stages of HCC. Furthermore, nicotinamide inhibited cell proliferation and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in HCC cell lines. It also increased the expression of p21, and the expression and acetylation of p53. These results strongly suggest that nicotinamide inhibits the progression of early-stage HCC and may contribute to the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation of HCC cells.

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy and is a devastating clinical complication of chronic liver disease. Therapeutic options are limited mainly because the genetic and biochemical understanding of this disease remains fragmented. We intended to study the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) aberrant signaling in HCC malignancy, and the therapeutic potential of inhibition of STAT3 expression for HCC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A 2'-O-methoxyethylribose-modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was used to knock down STAT3 expression in different human HCC cell lines, including the highly metastatic HCCLM3 derived from orthotopic implantation and subsequent lung metastasis in athymic mice. The effects of STAT3 ASO treatment on HCC cells, metastasis, and animal survival following HCCLM3 orthotopic implantation were evaluated. RESULTS: Specific suppression of phosphorylated STAT3 reduced its DNA-binding activity, inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, survivin, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, reduced cell proliferation and migratory potential, induced apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited intradermal angiogenesis and s.c. tumorigenesis upon injection in mice. In mice bearing orthotopically implanted HCCLM3, STAT3 inhibition following therapeutic treatment with STAT3 ASO reduced circulating vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, decreased intratumor CD34-positive microvessel density, intrahepatic and intraperitoneal transmission, and lung metastasis. HCC tumor volume and weight were reduced and the survival time of mice bearing orthotopically xenografted HCC was approximately doubled in STAT3 ASO-treated mice (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Constitutively activated STAT3 is essential for the growth, survival, and metastasis of HCC, suggesting that STAT3-targeted therapy may have utility for HCC."

Here, we analyze the activation of HSCs and PFs in CCL4 -induced and bile duct ligation-induced fibrosis mouse models, using single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We demonstrate that HSCs, rather than PFs, undergo dramatic transcriptomic changes, with the sequential activation of inflammatory, migrative, and extracellular matrix-producing programs. The data also reveal that HSCs are the exclusive source of myofibroblasts in CCL4 -treated liver, while PFs are the major source of myofibroblasts in early cholestatic liver fibrosis. Single-cell and lineage-tracing analysis also uncovers differential gene-expression features between HSCs and PFs; for example, nitric oxide receptor soluble guanylate cyclase is exclusively expressed in HSCs, but not in PFs. The soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator Riociguat potently reduced liver fibrosis in CCL4 -treated livers but showed no therapeutic efficacy in bile duct ligation livers. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a transcriptional roadmap for the activation of HSCs during liver fibrosis and yields comprehensive evidence that the differential transcriptomic features of HSCs and PFs, along with their relative contributions to liver fibrosis of different etiologies, should be considered in developing effective antifibrotic therapeutic strategies."

                "title": "Origin of myofibroblasts in the fibrotic liver in mice.",
                "abstract": "Hepatic myofibroblasts are activated in response to chronic liver injury of any etiology to produce a fibrous scar. Despite extensive studies, the origin of myofibroblasts in different types of fibrotic liver diseases is unresolved. To identify distinct populations of myofibroblasts and quantify their contribution to hepatic fibrosis of two different etiologies, collagen-\u03b11(I)-GFP mice were subjected to hepatotoxic (carbon tetrachloride; CCl4) or cholestatic (bile duct ligation; BDL) liver injury. All myofibroblasts were purified by flow cytometry of GFP(+) cells and then different subsets identified by phenotyping. Liver resident activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) and activated portal fibroblasts (aPFs) are the major source (>95%) of fibrogenic myofibroblasts in these models of liver fibrosis in mice. As previously reported using other methodologies, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major source of myofibroblasts (>87%) in CCl4 liver injury. However, aPFs are a major source of myofibroblasts in cholestatic liver injury, contributing >70% of myofibroblasts at the onset of injury (5 d BDL). The relative contribution of aPFs decreases with progressive injury, as HSCs become activated and contribute to the myofibroblast population (14 and 20 d BDL). Unlike aHSCs, aPFs respond to stimulation with taurocholic acid and IL-25 by induction of collagen-\u03b11(I) and IL-13, respectively. Furthermore, BDL-activated PFs express high levels of collagen type I and provide stimulatory signals to HSCs. Gene expression analysis identified several novel markers of aPFs, including a mesothelial-specific marker mesothelin. PFs may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver fibrosis and, therefore, serve as an attractive target for antifibrotic therapy. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver fibrosis is a pathological healing process resulting from hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and the generation of myofibroblasts from activated HSCs. The precise underlying mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis are still largely vague due to lack of understanding the functional heterogeneity of activated HSCs during liver injury. Approach and Results: In this study, to define the mechanism of HSC activation, we performed the transcriptomic analysis at single-cell resolution (scRNA-seq) on HSCs in mice treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). By employing LRAT-Cre:Rosa26mT/mG mice, we were able to isolate an activated GFP-positive HSC lineage derived cell population by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). A total of 8 HSC subpopulations were identified based on an unsupervised analysis. Each HSC cluster displayed a unique transcriptomic profile, despite all clusters expressing common mouse HSC marker genes. We demonstrated that one of the HSC subpopulations expressed high levels of mitosis regulatory genes, velocity, and monocle analysis indicated that these HSCs are at transitioning and proliferating phases at the beginning of HSCs activation and will eventually give rise to several other HSC subtypes. We also demonstrated cell clusters representing HSC-derived mature myofibroblast populations that express myofibroblasts hallmark genes with unique contractile properties. Most importantly, we found a novel HSC cluster that is likely to be critical in liver regeneration, immune reaction, and vascular remodeling, in which the unique profiles of genes such as Rgs5, Angptl6, and Meg3 are highly expressed. Lastly, we demonstrated that the heterogeneity of HSCs in the injured mouse livers is closely similar to that of cirrhotic human livers. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our scRNA-seq data provided insight into the landscape of activated HSC populations and the dynamic transitional pathway from HSC to myofibroblasts in response to liver injury."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies of the identity and pathophysiology of fibrogenic HSCs have been hampered by a lack of genetic tools that permit specific and inducible fate-mapping of these cells in vivo. Here, by single-cell RNA sequencing of nonparenchymal cells from mouse liver, we identified transcription factor 21 (Tcf21) as a unique marker that restricted its expression to quiescent HSCs. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Tracing Tcf21+ cells by Tcf21-CreER (Cre-Estrogen Receptor fusion protein under the control of Tcf21 gene promoter) targeted ~10% of all HSCs, most of which were located at periportal and pericentral zones. These HSCs were quiescent under steady state but became activated on injuries, generating 62%-67% of all myofibroblasts in fibrotic livers and ~85% of all cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in liver tumors. Conditional deletion of Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) by Tcf21-CreER blocked HSC activation, compromised liver fibrosis, and inhibited liver tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Tcf21-CreER-targeted perivenous stellate cells are the main source of myofibroblasts and CAFs in chronically injured livers.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts is a key event in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are canonical HSC activators after liver injury. The aim of this study was to analyze the epigenetic modulators that differentially control TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF signaling pathways. METHODS: We performed a transcriptomic comparison of HSCs treated with TGF-\u03b2 or PDGF-BB using RNA sequencing. Among the targets that distinguish these 2 pathways, we focused on the histone methyltransferase class of epigenetic modulators. RESULTS: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was expressed differentially, showing significant up-regulation in HSCs activated with TGF-\u03b2 but not with PDGF-BB. Indeed, EZH2 inhibition using either a pharmacologic (GSK-503) or a genetic (small interfering RNA) approach caused a significant attenuation of TGF-\u03b2-induced fibronectin, collagen 1\u03b11, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, both at messenger RNA and protein levels. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of EZH2 in HSCs resulted in a significant stimulation of fibronectin protein and messenger RNA levels in TGF-\u03b2-treated cells. Finally, we conducted in\u00a0vivo experiments with mice chronically treated with carbon tetrachloride or bile duct ligation. Administration of GSK-503 to mice receiving either carbon tetrachloride or bile duct ligation led to attenuated fibrosis as assessed by Trichrome and Sirius red stains, hydroxyproline, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin/collagen protein assays. CONCLUSIONS: TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF share redundant and distinct\u00a0transcriptomic targets, with the former predominating in HSC\u00a0activation. The EZH2 histone methyltransferase is\u00a0preferentially involved in the TGF-\u03b2 as opposed to the PDGF signaling pathway. Inhibition of EZH2 attenuates fibrogenic gene transcription in TGF-\u03b2-treated HSCs and reduces liver\u00a0fibrosis in\u00a0vivo.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal cells, including hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), fibroblasts (FBs), myofibroblasts (MFBs), and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), are the main cells that affect liver fibrosis and play crucial roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis. The dynamic evolution of mesenchymal cells is very important but remains to be explored for researching the reversible mechanism of hepatic fibrosis and its evolution mechanism of hepatic fibrosis to cirrhosis. METHODS: Here, we analysed the transcriptomes of more than 50,000 human single cells from three cirrhotic and three healthy liver tissue samples and the mouse hepatic mesenchymal cells of two healthy and two fibrotic livers to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of hepatic mesenchymal cells from a healthy to a cirrhotic state, and a subsequent integrative analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of HSCs from quiescent to active (using transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) to stimulate LX-2) to inactive states. RESULTS: We identified core genes and transcription factors (TFs) involved in mesenchymal cell differentiation. In healthy human and mouse livers, the expression of NR1H4 and members of the ZEB families (ZEB1 and ZEB2) changed significantly with the differentiation of FB into HSC and VSMC. In cirrhotic human livers, VSMCs transformed into HSCs with downregulation of MYH11, ACTA2, and JUNB and upregulation of PDGFRB, RGS5, IGFBP5, CD36, A2M, SOX5, and MEF2C. Following HSCs differentiation into MFBs with the upregulation of COL1A1, TIMP1, and NR1H4, a small number of MFBs reverted to inactivated HSCs (iHSCs). The differentiation trajectory of mouse hepatic mesenchymal cells was similar to that in humans; however, the evolution trajectory and proportion of cell subpopulations that reverted from MFBs to iHSCs suggest that the mouse model may not accurately reflect disease progression and outcome in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis elucidates primary genes and TFs involved in mesenchymal cell differentiation during liver fibrosis using scRNA-seq data, and demonstrated the core genes and TFs in process of HSC activation to MFB and MFB reversal to iHSC using bulk RNA-seq data of human fibrosis induced by TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, our findings suggest promising targets for the treatment of liver fibrosis and provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its onset and progression."

During chronic liver disease, resting HSCs become activated by inflammatory and injury signals. However, HSCs/MFB not only produce collagen, but also secrete cytokines, participate in metabolism, and have biomechanical properties. We herein aimed to characterize the heterogeneity of these liver mesenchymal cells by single cell RNA sequencing. In vivo resting HSCs or activated MFB were isolated from C57BL6/J mice challenged by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intraperitoneally for 3 weeks to induce liver fibrosis and compared to in vitro cultivated MFB. While resting HSCs formed a homogenous population characterized by high platelet derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) expression, in vivo and in vitro activated MFB split into heterogeneous populations, characterized by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagens, or immunological markers. S100 calcium binding protein A6 (S100A6) was a universal marker of activated MFB on both the gene and protein expression level. Compared to the heterogeneity of in vivo MFB, MFB in vitro sequentially and only transiently expressed marker genes, such as chemokines, during culture activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate the heterogeneity of HSCs and MFB, indicating the existence of functionally relevant subsets in hepatic fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Mesothelial cells (MCs) form a single layer of the mesothelium and cover the liver surface. A previous study demonstrated that, upon liver injury, MCs migrate inward from the liver surface and give rise to hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in biliary fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) or myofibroblasts in CCl4-induced fibrosis. The present study analyzed the role of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling in mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT) and the fate of MCs during liver fibrosis and its regression. Deletion of TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor (Tgfbr2) gene in cultured MCs suppressed TGF-\u03b2-mediated myofibroblastic conversion. Conditional deletion of Tgfbr2 gene in MCs reduced the differentiation of MCs to HSCs and myofibroblasts in the BDL and CCl4 models, respectively, indicating that the direct TGF-\u03b2 signaling in MCs is responsible to MMT. After BDL and CCl4 treatment, MC-derived HSCs and myofibroblasts were distributed near the liver surface and the thickness of collagen was increased in Glisson's capsule beneath the liver surface. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that MC-derived HSCs and myofibroblasts store little vitamin A lipids and have fibrogenic phenotype in the fibrotic livers. MCs contributed to 1.4 and 2.0% of activated HSCs in the BDL and CCl4 models, respectively. During regression of CCl4-induced fibrosis, 20% of MC-derived myofibroblasts survived in the liver and deactivated to vitamin A-poor HSCs. Our data indicate that MCs participate in capsular fibrosis by supplying vitamin A-poor HSCs during a process of liver fibrosis and regression. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) belongs to the lipocalin superfamily, sharing a barrel-shaped tertiary structure with a hydrophobic pocket and an ability to bind lipophilic molecules. LCN2 has recently emerged as an important modulator of cellular homeostasis in several organs, i.e. heart, lung and kidney, but little is known about the expression of LCN2 in acute and chronic liver injury. AIMS: In this study, we wanted to analyse the expression and regulation of LCN2 in models of acute and chronic experimental liver injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed LCN2 expression in livers of rats subjected to bile duct ligation or repeated doses of carbon tetrachloride and tested the impact of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary liver cells. RESULTS: By using primary cultures of hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes isolated from normal and injured rat livers, we found a significant LCN2 expression in early hepatic stellate cell cultures, a lower expression in fully transdifferentiated myofibroblasts and no expression in freshly isolated hepatocytes. However, LCN2 expression and secretion in hepatocytes increased dramatically during culturing. In addition, chronic in vivo liver injury resulting from both bile duct ligation and repeated application of carbon tetrachloride resulted in rapid and well-sustained induction of LCN2 expression. Immunohistochemistry and primary liver cell isolation identified injured hepatocytes as the main source of LCN2 production. LCN2 is strongly induced in both primary hepatocytes and immortalized hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 via nuclear factor-\u03baB activation, but not by the profibrotic cytokines platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. CONCLUSION: LCN2 expression shows clear correlation to liver damage and resulting inflammatory responses, rather than to the degree of liver fibrosis, which in fact may imply a distinct diagnostic value as an early biomarker of liver inflammation."

                "abstract": "Background & Aims: Chronic liver disease (CLD) remains a global health issue associated with a significant disease burden. Liver fibrosis, a hallmark of CLD, is characterised by the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that gain profibrotic characteristics including increased production of extracellular matrix protein. Currently, no antifibrotic therapies are available clinically, in part because of the lack of HSC-specific drug targets. Here, we aimed to identify HSC-specific membrane proteins that can serve as targets for antifibrotic drug development. Methods: Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of GPR176 was used to assess the in\u00a0vitro function of GPR176 in HSCs and in precision cut liver slices (PCLS). The in\u00a0vivo role of GPR176 was assessed using the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and common bile duct ligation (BDL) models in wild-type and GPR176 knockout mice. GPR176 in human CLD was assessed by immunohistochemistry of diseased human livers and RNA expression analysis in human primary HSCs and transcriptomic data sets. Results: We identified Gpr176, an orphan G-protein coupled receptor, as an HSC-enriched activation associated gene. In vitro, Gpr176 is strongly induced upon culture-induced and hepatocyte-damage-induced activation of primary HSCs. Knockdown of GPR176 in primary mouse HSCs or PCLS cultures resulted in reduced fibrogenic characteristics. Absence of GPR176 did not influence liver homeostasis, but Gpr176-/- mice developed less severe fibrosis in CCl4 and BDL fibrosis models. In humans, GPR176 expression was correlated with in\u00a0vitro HSC activation and with fibrosis stage in patients with CLD. Conclusions: GPR176 is a functional protein during liver fibrosis and reducing its activity attenuates fibrogenesis. These results highlight the potential of GPR176 as an HSC-specific antifibrotic candidate to treat CLD. Impact and implications: The lack of effective antifibrotic drugs is partly attributed to the insufficient knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the development of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate that the G-protein coupled receptor GPR176 contributes to fibrosis development. Since GPR176 is specifically expressed on the membrane of activated hepatic stellate cells and is linked with fibrosis progression in humans, it opens new avenues for the development of targeted interventions."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Liver fibrosis is a prelude to a host of end-stage liver diseases. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), switching from a quiescent state to myofibroblasts, are the major source for excessive production of extracellular matrix proteins. In the present study, we investigated the role of Suv39h1, a lysine methyltransferase, in HSC-myofibroblast transition and the implication in liver fibrosis. DESIGN: HSC-specific or myofibroblast-specific Suv39h1 deletion was achieved by crossbreeding the Suv39h1 f/f mice to the Lrat-Cre mice or the Postn-CreERT2 mice. Liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injection or bile duct ligation. RESULTS: We report that Suv39h1 expression was universally upregulated during HSC-myofibroblast transition in different cell and animal models of liver fibrosis and in human cirrhotic liver tissues. Consistently, Suv39h1 knockdown blocked HSC-myofibroblast transition in vitro. HSC-specific or myofibroblast-specific deletion of Suv39h1 ameliorated liver fibrosis in mice. More importantly, Suv39h1 inhibition by a small-molecule compound chaetocin dampened HSC-myofibroblast transition in cell culture and mitigated liver fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, Suv39h1 bound to the promoter of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and repressed HMOX1 transcription. HMOX1 depletion blunted the effects of Suv39h1 inhibition on HSC-myofibroblast transition in vitro and liver fibrosis in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HMOX1 might contribute to HSC-myofibroblast transition by modulating retinol homeostasis. Finally, myofibroblast-specific HMOX1 overexpression attenuated liver fibrosis in both a preventive scheme and a therapeutic scheme. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a previously unrecognised role for Suv39h1 in liver fibrosis and offer proof-of-concept of its targetability in the intervention of cirrhosis."

                "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis is the result of an excessive wound-healing response subsequent to chronic liver injury. A feature of liver fibrogenesis is the secretion and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here we report that upregulation of EphB2 is a prominent feature of two mouse models of hepatic fibrosis and also observed in humans with liver cirrhosis. EphB2 is upregulated and activated in mouse HSCs following chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure. Moreover, we show that EphB2 deficiency attenuates liver fibrosis and inflammation and this is correlated with an overall reduction in pro-fibrotic markers, inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. In an in vitro system of HSCs activation we observed an impaired proliferation and sub-optimal differentiation into fibrogenic myofibroblasts of HSCs isolated from EphB2-/- mice compared to HSCs isolated from wild type mice. This supports the hypothesis that EphB2 promotes liver fibrosis partly via activation of HSCs. Cellular apoptosis which is generally observed during the regression of liver fibrogenesis was increased in liver specimens of CCl4-treated EphB2-/- mice compared to littermate controls. This data is suggestive of an active repair/regeneration system in the absence of EphB2. Altogether, our data validate this novel pro-fibrotic function of EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase."

The present study aimed to isolate these cells, characterize their phenotypes, and examine their contribution to myofibroblasts in liver fibrosis. METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced in Collagen1a1-green fluorescent protein (Col1a1(GFP)) mice by bile duct ligation (BDL), 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet, or CCl4 injections. Combining vitamin A (VitA) lipid autofluorescence and expression of GFP and glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A), we separated HSCs, PFs, and MCs from normal and fibrotic livers by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS: Normal Col1a1(GFP) livers broadly expressed GFP in HSCs, PFs, and MCs. Isolated VitA+ HSCs expressed reelin, whereas VitA-GFP+GPM6A- PFs expressed ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-2 and elastin. VitA-GFP+GPM6A+ MCs expressed keratin 19, mesothelin, and uroplakin 1b. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 treatment induced the transformation of HSCs, PFs, and MCs into myofibroblasts in culture. TGF-\u03b21 suppressed cyclin D1 mRNA expression in PFs but not in HSCs and MCs. In biliary fibrosis, PFs adjacent to the bile duct expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. FACS analysis revealed that HSCs are the major source of GFP+ myofibroblasts in the injured Col1a1(GFP) mice after DDC or CCl4 treatment. Although PFs partly contributed to GFP+ myofibroblasts in the BDL model, HSCs were still dominant source of myofibroblasts. CONCLUSION: HSCs, PFs, and MCs have distinct phenotypes, and PFs partly contribute to myofibroblasts in the portal triad in biliary fibrosis."

Our study revealed that Reelin+ cells were a new HSC subset. In terms of activation, migration, and proliferation, Reelin+ HSCs displayed different properties from Desmin+ HSCs (total HSCs) in cholestatic liver injury model but shared similar properties to total HSCs in hepatotoxic liver injury model. Besides, we did not find evidence that Reelin+ HSCs transdifferentiated into hepatocytes or cholangiocytes through mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET).

The role of PSMP was evaluated in Psmp-/- mice and after treatment with a PSMP antibody in wild-type mice. The direct effects of PSMP on macrophages and hepatic stellate cells were studied in\u00a0vitro. RESULTS: In this study, we found that PSMP was highly expressed in fibrotic/cirrhotic tissues from patients with different etiologies of liver disease and in the 3 experimental mouse models of fibrosis. Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules HMGB-1 and IL-33 induced hepatocytes to produce PSMP. PSMP deficiency resulted in a marked amelioration of hepatic injury and fibrosis. In CCl4-induced hepatic injury, the infiltration of macrophages and CCR2+ monocytes into the liver was significantly decreased in Psmp-/- mice. Consistent with the decreased levels of intrahepatic macrophages, proinflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced. Moreover, adeno-associated virus-8 vectors successfully overexpressing human PSMP in Psmp-/- mouse livers could reverse the attenuation of liver injury and fibrosis induced by CCl4 in a CCR2-dependent manner. Treatment with a specific PSMP-neutralizing antibody, 3D5, prevented liver injury and fibrosis induced by CCl4 in mice. At the cellular level, PSMP directly promoted M1 polarization of macrophages and activation of LX-2 cells. CONCLUSION: PSMP enhances liver fibrosis through its receptor, CCR2. PSMP is a potentially attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis. LAY SUMMARY: Our present study identifies the essential role of the protein PSMP for the development and progression of liver fibrosis in humans and mice. PSMP promotes liver fibrosis through inflammatory macrophage infiltration, polarization and production of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as direct activation of hepatic stellate cells via its receptor CCR2. A PSMP antibody can significantly reduce liver fibrosis development in\u00a0vivo. These findings indicate that PSMP is a potential therapeutic target and its antibody is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for which there is currently no effective therapy. We previously showed that 2-(3-pentylphenyl)acetic acid (PBI-4050) is a dual G protein-coupled receptor GPR40 agonist/GPR84 antagonist that exerts antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative action. We evaluated PBI-4050 for the treatment of liver fibrosis in vivo and elucidated its mechanism of action on human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The antifibrotic effect of PBI-4050 was evaluated in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)- and bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis rodent models. Treatment with PBI-4050 suppressed CCl4-induced serum aspartate aminotransferase levels, inflammatory marker nitric oxide synthase, epithelial to mesenchymal transition transcription factor Snail, and multiple profibrotic factors. PBI-4050 also decreased GPR84 mRNA expression in CCl4-induced injury, while restoring peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) to the control level. Collagen deposition and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) protein levels were also attenuated by PBI-4050 treatment in the bile duct ligation rat model. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated primary HSCs were used to examine the effect of PBI-4050 and its mechanism of action in vitro. PBI-4050 inhibited HSC proliferation by arresting cells in the G0/G1 cycle phase. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that PBI-4050 signals through a reduction of intracellular ATP levels, activation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and blockade of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in reduced protein and mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA and connective tissue growth factor and restored PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression. Our findings suggest that PBI-4050 may exert antifibrotic activity in the liver through a novel mechanism of action involving modulation of intracellular ATP levels and the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR pathway in stellate cells, and PBI-4050 may be a promising agent for treating liver fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sept4, a subunit of the septin cytoskeleton specifically expressed in quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), is downregulated through transdifferentiation to fibrogenic and contractile myofibroblastic cells. Since Sept4(-/-)mice are prone to liver fibrosis, we aimed to identify the unknown molecular network underlying liver fibrosis by probing the association between loss of Sept4 and accelerated transdifferentiation of HSCs. METHODS: We compared the transcriptomes of Sept4(+/+) and Sept4(-/-) HSCs undergoing transdifferentiation by DNA microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Because Dickkopf2 (Dkk2) gene expression is reduced in Sept4(-/-) HSCs, we tested whether supplementing Dkk2 could suppress myofibroblastic transformation of Sept4(-/-) HSCs. We tested the involvement of the canonical Wnt pathway in this process by using a lymphoid enhancer-binding factor/transcription factor-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: We observed consistent upregulation of Dkk2 in primary cultured HSCs and in a carbon tetrachloride liver fibrosis in mice, which was decreased in the absence of Sept4. Supplementation with Dkk2 suppressed the induction of pro-fibrotic genes (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin and 2 collagen genes) and induced an anti-fibrotic gene (Smad7) in Sept4(-/-) HSCs. In human liver specimens with inflammation and fibrosis, Dkk2 immunoreactivity appeared to be positively correlated with the degree of fibrotic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-fibrotic transformation of HSCs through the loss of Sept4 is, in part, due to reduced expression of Dkk2 and its homologues, and the resulting disinhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a key player in the progression of liver fibrosis, are activated by various inflammatory stimuli and converted to myofibroblast-like cells with excessive collagen production. Despite many attempts to suppress activation of HSCs or inhibit collagen production in activated HSCs, their clinical applications have not been established yet. Recently, the deactivation of HSCs has been reported as a mechanism underlying the reversibility of experimental liver fibrosis. In the present study, we sought for deactivation factors of HSCs that induce regression of established liver fibrosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We identified transcription factor 21 (Tcf21) as one of the transcription factors whose expression was up-regulated in parallel to the differentiation of fetal HSCs. Expression of Tcf21 in HSCs remarkably decreased during culture-induced activation in vitro and in murine and human fibrotic liver tissue in vivo. This reduced Tcf21 expression was recovered during the spontaneous regression of murine liver fibrosis. Tcf21 was also examined for its effects by adeno-associated virus serotype 6-mediated Tcf21 gene transfer into cultured activated HSCs and mice with carbon tetrachloride- or methionine-choline deficient diet-induced liver fibrosis. Overexpression of Tcf21 in activated HSCs not only suppressed fibrogenic gene expression but also restored cells, at least in part, to a quiescent phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. These phenotypic changes of HSCs were accompanied by the regression of steatohepatitis and fibrosis and improved hepatic architecture and function. CONCLUSIONS: Tcf21 has been identified as a deactivation factor of fibrogenic HSCs, providing insight into a treatment strategy for the otherwise intractable liver fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of cirrhosis, a disabling outcome of defective liver repair, involves deregulated accumulation of myofibroblasts derived from quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), but the mechanisms that control transdifferentiation of HSCs are poorly understood. We investigated whether the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway controls the fate of HSCs by regulating metabolism. METHODS: Microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblot analyses were used to identify metabolic genes that were differentially expressed in quiescent vs myofibroblast HSCs. Glycolysis and lactate production were disrupted in HSCs to determine if metabolism influenced transdifferentiation. Hh signaling and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) activity were altered to identify factors that alter glycolytic activity. Changes in expression of genes that regulate glycolysis were quantified and localized in biopsy samples from patients with cirrhosis and liver samples from mice following administration of CCl(4) or bile duct ligation. Mice were given systemic inhibitors of Hh to determine if they affect glycolytic activity of the hepatic stroma; Hh signaling was also conditionally disrupted in myofibroblasts to determine the effects of glycolytic activity. RESULTS: Transdifferentiation of cultured, quiescent HSCs into myofibroblasts induced glycolysis and caused lactate accumulation. Increased expression of genes that regulate glycolysis required Hh signaling and involved induction of HIF1\u03b1. Inhibitors of Hh signaling, HIF1\u03b1, glycolysis, or lactate accumulation converted myofibroblasts to quiescent HSCs. In diseased livers of animals and patients, numbers of glycolytic stromal cells were associated with the severity of fibrosis. Conditional disruption of Hh signaling in myofibroblasts reduced numbers of glycolytic myofibroblasts and liver fibrosis in mice; similar effects were observed following administration of pharmacologic inhibitors of Hh. CONCLUSIONS: Hedgehog signaling controls the fate of HSCs by regulating metabolism. These findings might be applied to diagnosis and treatment of patients with cirrhosis."

                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Activation of the renin angiotensin system resulting in stimulation of angiotensin-II (AngII) type I receptor (AT1R) is an important factor in the development of liver fibrosis. Here, we investigated the role of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) as a newly described intracellular effector of AT1R in mediating liver fibrosis. Fibrotic liver samples from rodents and humans were compared to respective controls. Transcription, protein expression, activation, and localization of JAK2 and downstream effectors were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Experimental fibrosis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL), CCl4 intoxication, thioacetamide intoxication or continuous AngII infusion. JAK2 was inhibited by AG490. In vitro experiments were performed with primary rodent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatocytes as well as primary human and human-derived LX2 cells. JAK2 expression and activity were increased in experimental rodent and human liver fibrosis, specifically in myofibroblastic HSCs. AT1R stimulation in wild-type animals led to activation of HSCs and fibrosis in vivo through phosphorylation of JAK2 and subsequent RhoA/Rho-kinase activation. These effects were prevented in AT1R(-/-) mice. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK2 attenuated liver fibrosis in rodent fibrosis models. In vitro, JAK2 and downstream effectors showed increased expression and activation in activated HSCs, when compared to quiescent HSCs, KCs, and hepatocytes isolated from rodents. In primary human and LX2 cells, AG490 blocked AngII-induced profibrotic gene expression. Overexpression of JAK2 led to increased profibrotic gene expression in LX2 cells, which was blocked by AG490. CONCLUSION: Our study substantiates the important cell-intrinsic role of JAK2 in HSCs for development of liver fibrosis. Inhibition of JAK2 might therefore offer a promising therapy for liver fibrosis."

                "abstract": "The persistent transformation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts (MFs) and the excessive proliferation of MF-HSCs in the liver contribute to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Glycolysis inhibition of MF-HSCs can reverse their MF phenotype and suppress their abnormal expansion. Here, we have developed vitamin A-derivative (VA) decorated PEG-PCL polymeric micelles to encapsulate the labile and hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) and direct its active attack on HSCs, selectively inhibiting of HIF-1\u03b1 and cellular glycolysis, ultimately repressing hepatic fibrogenesis. The obtained micelles exhibited a good stability, biocompatibility, pH sensitivity, and exceptional HSC-targetability, allowing an efficient accumulation of their carried CPT in acutely and chronically injured livers. On their intracellular release of CPT specifically in MF-HSCs, these CPT micelles nicely inhibited the HIF-1\u03b1 and a series of glycolytic players in MF-HSCs and prominently suppressed their proliferation and MF phenotypic characteristics. Accordingly, on in vitro administration to the mice challenged by CCl4 or subjected to bile duct ligation, these VA-decorated CPT micelles ameliorated the pathological symptoms of the livers, as evidenced by the significant reduction in serum levels of ALT and AST, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and collagen accumulation, the drastic down-regulation of multiple fibrotic genes, and the good recovery of attenuated hepatocyte CYP2E1 and lipogenesis regulator PPAR\u03b3. Overall, the CPT carried by VA-decorated PEG-PCL polymeric micelles can selectively inhibit the glycolysis and expansion of HSCs and thus suppress fibrogenesis, providing an original and effective approach for anti-fibrotic therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our work introduces an innovative antifibrotic drug system that is developed upon the active targeting of CPT and aims for the fate reversal of HSCs. Through HSC-targeted delivery achieved by PEG-PCL polymeric micelles decorated with vitamin A-derivatives, CPT significantly suppressed the expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 and glycolytic enzymes in MF-HSCs, as well as their pathologic expansion in mouse livers. It effectively ameliorated chronic liver fibrosis in mice induced by CCl4 injection or BDL and restored the damaged liver structure and function. These compelling findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of glycolytic HSC-targeting in combating fibrosis and related disorders and thus provide new promise for future clinical management of such prevalent and life-threatening conditions."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatic steatosis is a hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common comorbidity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex and involves the crosstalk between the liver and the white adipose tissue (WAT). Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) has been shown to control tissue lipid accumulation by regulating the transport properties of the vasculature. The role of VEGF-B signaling and the contribution to hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in T2DM is currently not understood. METHODS: C57BL/6\u00a0J mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against VEGF-B, or mice with adipocyte-specific overexpression or under-expression of VEGF-B (AdipoqCre+/VEGF-BTG/+ mice and AdipoqCre+/Vegfbfl/+mice) were subjected to a 6-month high-fat diet (HFD), or chow-diet, whereafter NAFLD development was assessed. VEGF-B expression was analysed in WAT biopsies from patients with obesity and NAFLD in a pre-existing clinical cohort (n\u00a0= 24 patients with NAFLD and n\u00a0= 24 without NAFLD) and correlated to clinicopathological features. RESULTS: Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF-B signaling in diabetic mice reduced hepatic steatosis and NAFLD by blocking WAT lipolysis. Mechanistically we show, by using HFD-fed AdipoqCre+/VEGF-BTG/+ mice and HFD-fed AdipoqCre+/Vegfbfl/+mice, that inhibition of VEGF-B signaling targets lipolysis in adipocytes. Reducing VEGF-B signaling ameliorated NAFLD by decreasing WAT inflammation, resolving WAT insulin resistance, and lowering the activity of the hormone sensitive lipase. Analyses of human WAT biopsies from individuals with NAFLD provided evidence supporting the contribution of VEGF-B signaling to NAFLD development. VEGF-B expression levels in adipocytes from two WAT depots correlated with development of dysfunctional WAT and NAFLD in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data from mouse models and humans suggest that VEGF-B antagonism may represent an approach to combat NAFLD by targeting hepatic steatosis through suppression of lipolysis. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common comorbidity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and has a global prevalence of between 25-29%. There are currently no approved drugs for NAFLD, and given the scale of the ongoing diabetes epidemics, there is an urgent need to identify new treatment options. Our work suggests that VEGF-B antagonism may represent an approach to combat NAFLD by targeting hepatic steatosis through suppression of lipolysis. The neutralizing anti-VEGF-B antibody, which was used in this study, has already entered clinical trials for patients with diabetes. Therefore, we believe that our results are of great general interest to a broad audience, including patients and patient organizations, the medical community, academia, the life science industry and the public."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many chronic metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), are closely related to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state in tissues. The high prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with T2DM is related to the role of inflammation in the disease. In this study, we investigated the role of liraglutide in improving lipid metabolism disorders and preventing their progression to NAFLD by modulating inflammatory signaling pathways, thereby providing new treatment options for NAFLD. METHODS: We designed a 2\u00d72 factorial analysis experiment. A mouse model of NAFLD with T2DM was established by feeding the animals a high-fat diet (HFD). The NAFLD mice with HFD-induced diabetes were treated with liraglutide for 10 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining and electron microscopy were used to observe the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of \u03b1-SMA, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB and the NF-\u03baB inhibitory protein I\u03baB in the liver at the gene and protein levels, respectively. RESULTS: Liraglutide reduced the body weight and fasting blood glucose levels of HFD-fed mice. The expression of \u03b1-SMA, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB in the liver of HFD-fed mice was increased at the mRNA and protein levels, but liraglutide treatment decreased the expression of these molecules. The expression of I\u03baB in the liver decreased at the mRNA and protein levels but was upregulated after liraglutide treatment. CONCLUSION: Based on the current findings, liraglutide can significantly improve hepatic steatosis, primarily by downregulating the expression of inflammatory signaling mediators in the TNF-\u03b1 pathway."

                "abstract": "Background: ApoA5 mainly synthesized and secreted by liver is a key modulator of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Although the role of ApoA5 in extrahepatic triglyceride (TG) metabolism in circulation has been well documented, the relationship between ApoA5 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains incompletely understood and the underlying molecular mechanism still needs to be elucidated. Methods: We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to delete Apoa5 gene from Syrian golden hamster, a small rodent model replicating human metabolic features. Then, the ApoA5-deficient (ApoA5-/-) hamsters were used to investigate NAFLD with or without challenging a high fat diet (HFD). Results: ApoA5-/- hamsters exhibited hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) with markedly elevated TG levels at 2300 mg/dL and hepatic steatosis on a regular chow diet, accompanied with an increase in the expression levels of genes regulating lipolysis and small adipocytes in the adipose tissue. An HFD challenge predisposed ApoA5-/- hamsters to severe HTG (sHTG) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo revealed that targeting ApoA5 disrupted NR1D1 mRNA stability in the HepG2 cells and the liver to reduce both mRNA and protein levels of NR1D1, respectively. Overexpression of human NR1D1 by adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) in the livers of ApoA5-/- hamsters significantly ameliorated fatty liver without affecting plasma lipid levels. Moreover, restoration of hepatic ApoA5 or activation of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by cold exposure or CL316243 administration could significantly correct sHTG and hepatic steatosis in ApoA5-/- hamsters. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that HTG caused by ApoA5 deficiency in hamsters is sufficient to elicit hepatic steatosis and HFD aggravates NAFLD by reducing hepatic NR1D1 mRNA and protein levels, which provides a mechanistic link between ApoA5 and NAFLD and suggests the new insights into the potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of HTG and the related disorders due to ApoA5 deficiency in the clinical trials in future."

                "abstract": "NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is a multifactorial liver disease related to multiple causes or unhealthy conditions, including obesity and chronic inflammation. The accumulation of excess triglycerides, called steatosis, is known as a hallmark of an imbalance between the rates of hepatic fatty acid uptake/synthesis and oxidation/export. Furthermore, occurrence of NAFLD may lead to a cocktail of disease consequences caused by the altered metabolism of glucose, lipids, and lipoproteins, for instance, insulin resistance, type II diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, and even hepatocarcinogenesis. Due to the complexity of the occurrence of NAFLD, a multi-targeting strategy is highly recommended to effectively address the issue and combat the causal loop. Ethanol extracts of legumes are popular supplements due to their richness and diversity in phytochemicals, especially isoflavones and anthocyanins. Although many of them have been reported to have efficacy in the treatment of different metabolic syndromes and obesity, there have not been many studies on them as a supplemental mixture. In this study, the alleviative effects of selected legume ethanol extracts (CrE) on high-fat-diet- and fructose-induced obesity, liver steatosis, and hyperglycemia are discussed. As revealed by the findings, CrE not only ameliorated obesity in terms of weight gained and enlargement of adipose tissue, but also significantly reduced the incidence of steatosis via phosphorylation of AMPK, resulting in inhibition of the downstream SREBP-1c/FAS pathway and an increase in an indicator of \u03b2-oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a, CPT1A). Furthermore, CrE dramatically alleviated inflammatory responses, including both plasma and hepatic TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels. CrE also had attenuating effects on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance and significantly reduced the fasting glucose level, fasting insulin level, and plasma leptin, and it exhibited positive effects in the Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). At the molecular level, CrE could activate the PI3K/Akt/Glut2 pathway, which indicated an increase in insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that ethanol extracts of legumes could be potential supplements for metabolic syndromes, and their efficacy and effectiveness might facilitate the multi-targeting strategy required to mitigate NAFLD."

                "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most prevalent liver disease globally. Pea albumin (PA) has demonstrated positive impacts on reducing obesity and improving glucose metabolism. In this research, a mouse model of NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) was employed to examine the impact of PA on NAFLD and explore its potential mechanisms. The findings revealed that mice subjected to a HFD developed pronounced fatty liver alterations. The intervention with PA significantly lowered serum TC by 26.81%, TG by 43.55%, and LDL-C by 57.79%. It also elevated HDL-C levels by 1.2 fold and reduced serum ALT by 37.94% and AST by 31.21% in mice fed a HFD. These changes contributed to the reduction in hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation. Additionally, PA improved insulin resistance and inhibited hepatic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Mechanistic studies revealed that PA alleviated lipid accumulation in HFD-induced NAFLD by activating the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 and ACC, inhibiting the expression of SREBF1 and FASN to reduce hepatic lipogenesis, and increasing the expression of ATGL, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 to promote lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. These results indicate that PA could serve as a dietary supplement for alleviating NAFLD, offering a theoretical foundation for the rational intake of PA in NAFLD intervention."

                "title": "A novel fatty acid mimetic with pan-PPAR partial agonist activity inhibits diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.",
                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of metabolic diseases is increasing globally at an alarming rate; thus, it is essential that effective, accessible, low-cost therapeutics are developed. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that tightly regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism and are important drug targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. We previously identified LDT409, a fatty acid-like compound derived from cashew nut shell liquid, as a novel pan-active PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3/\u03b4 compound. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy of LDT409 in\u00a0vivo and investigate the molecular mechanisms governing the actions of the fatty acid mimetic LDT409 in diet-induced obese mice. METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice (6-11-month-old) were fed a chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks; mice thereafter received once daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, 10\u00a0mg/kg Rosiglitazone, 40\u00a0mg/kg WY14643, or 40\u00a0mg/kg LDT409 for 18 days while continuing the HFD. During treatments, body weight, food intake, glucose and insulin tolerance, energy expenditure, and intestinal lipid absorption were measured. On day 18 of treatment, tissues and plasma were collected for histological, molecular, and biochemical analysis. RESULTS: We found that treatment with LDT409 was effective at reversing HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities in mice. LDT409 lowered food intake and hyperlipidemia, while improving insulin tolerance. Despite being a substrate of both PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3, LDT409 was crucial for promoting hepatic fatty acid oxidation and reducing hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. We also highlighted a role for LDT409 in white and brown adipocytes in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo where it decreased fat accumulation, increased lipolysis, induced browning of WAT, and upregulated thermogenic gene Ucp1. Remarkably, LDT409 reversed HFD-induced weight gain back to chow-fed control levels. We determined that the LDT409-induced weight-loss was associated with a combination of increased energy expenditure (detectable before weight loss was apparent), decreased food intake, increased systemic fat utilization, and increased fecal lipid excretion in HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, LDT409 represents a fatty acid mimetic that generates a uniquely favorable metabolic response for the treatment of multiple abnormalities including obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and diabetes. LDT409 is derived from a highly abundant natural product-based starting material and its development could be pursued as a therapeutic solution to the global metabolic health crisis."

                "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a wide spectrum of liver diseases that extends from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Although the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains undefined, it is recognized that insulin resistance is present in almost all patients who develop this disease. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) act as an insulin sensitizer and have been used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and other insulin-resistant conditions, including NAFLD. Hence, therapy of NAFLD with insulin-sensitizing drugs should ideally improve the key hepatic histological changes, while also reducing cardiometabolic and cancer risks. Controversially, TZDs are associated with the development of cardiovascular events and liver problems. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve liver function in patients with chronic liver diseases. The aim of the present study was to assess the therapeutic effects of LPSF/GQ-02 on the liver of LDLR-/- mice after a high-fat diet. Eighty male mice were divided into 4 groups and two different experiments: 1-received a standard diet; 2-fed with a high-fat diet (HFD); 3-HFD+pioglitazone; 4-HFD+LPSF/GQ-02. The experiments were conducted for 10 or 12 weeks and in the last two or four weeks respectively, the drugs were administered daily by gavage. The results obtained with an NAFLD murine model indicated that LPSF/GQ-02 was effective in improving the hepatic architecture, decreasing fat accumulation, reducing the amount of collagen, decreasing inflammation by reducing IL-6, iNOS, COX-2 and F4 / 80, and increasing the protein expression of I\u03baB\u03b1, cytoplasmic NF\u03baB-65, eNOS and IRS-1 in mice LDLR -/-. These results suggest a direct action by LPSF/GQ-02 on the factors that affect inflammation, insulin resistance and fat accumulation in the liver of these animals. Further studies are being conducted in our laboratory to investigate the possible mechanism of action of LPSF/GQ-02 on hepatic lipid metabolism. "

                "abstract": "Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation that drives the development of metabolic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We recently showed that white adipose tissue (WAT) constitutes an important source of inflammatory factors. Hence, interventions that attenuate WAT inflammation may reduce NAFLD development. Male LDLr-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks followed by 7 weeks of HFD with or without rosiglitazone. Effects on WAT inflammation and NAFLD development were analyzed using biochemical and (immuno)histochemical techniques, combined with gene expression analyses. Nine weeks of HFD feeding induced obesity and WAT inflammation, which progressed gradually until the end of the study. Rosiglitazone fully blocked progression of WAT inflammation and activated PPAR\u03b3 significantly in WAT. Rosiglitazone intervention did not activate PPAR\u03b3 in liver, but improved liver histology and counteracted the expression of genes associated with severe NAFLD in humans. Rosiglitazone reduced expression of pro-inflammatory factors in WAT (TNF-\u03b1, leptin) and increased expression of adiponectin, which was reflected in plasma. Furthermore, rosiglitazone lowered circulating levels of pro-inflammatory saturated fatty acids. Together, these observations provide a rationale for the observed indirect hepatoprotective effects and suggest that WAT represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity-associated NAFLD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity-associated inflammation is a key player in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the role of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1, CD204) remains incompletely understood. METHODS: A total of 170 NAFLD liver biopsies were processed for transcriptomic analysis and correlated with clinicopathological features. Msr1-/- and wild-type mice were subjected to a 16-week high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. Mice and ex\u00a0vivo human liver slices were treated with a monoclonal antibody against MSR1. Genetic susceptibility was assessed using genome-wide association study data from 1,483 patients with NAFLD and 430,101 participants of the UK Biobank. RESULTS: MSR1 expression was associated with the occurrence of hepatic lipid-laden foamy macrophages and correlated with the degree of steatosis and steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD. Mice lacking Msr1 were protected against diet-induced metabolic disorder, showing fewer hepatic foamy macrophages, less hepatic inflammation, improved dyslipidaemia and glucose tolerance, and altered hepatic lipid metabolism. Upon induction by saturated fatty acids, MSR1 induced a pro-inflammatory response via the JNK signalling pathway. In\u00a0vitro blockade of the receptor prevented the accumulation of lipids in primary macrophages which inhibited the switch towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype and the release of cytokines such as TNF-\u0251. Targeting MSR1 using monoclonal antibody therapy in an obesity-associated NAFLD mouse model and human liver slices resulted in the prevention of foamy macrophage formation and inflammation. Moreover, we identified that rs41505344, a polymorphism in the upstream transcriptional region of MSR1, was associated with altered serum triglycerides and aspartate aminotransferase levels in a cohort of over 400,000 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that MSR1 plays a critical role in lipid-induced inflammation and could thus be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD. LAY SUMMARY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic disease primarily caused by excessive consumption of fat and sugar combined with a lack of exercise or a sedentary lifestyle. Herein, we show that the macrophage scavenger receptor MSR1, an innate immune receptor, mediates lipid uptake and accumulation in Kupffer cells, resulting in liver inflammation and thereby promoting the progression of NAFLD in humans and mice."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly associated with abdominal obesity. Growing evidence suggests that inflammation in specific depots of white adipose tissue (WAT) has a key role in NAFLD progression, but experimental evidence for a causal role of WAT is lacking. METHODS: A time-course study in C57BL/6J mice was performed to establish which WAT depot is most susceptible to develop inflammation during high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Crown-like structures (CLS) were quantified in epididymal (eWAT), mesenteric (mWAT) and inguinal/subcutaneous (iWAT) WAT. The contribution of inflamed WAT to NAFLD progression was investigated by surgical removal of a selected WAT depot and compared with sham surgery. Plasma markers were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cytokines/adipokines) and lipidomics (lipids). RESULTS: In eWAT, CLS were formed already after 12 weeks of HFD, which coincided with maximal adipocyte size and fat depot mass, and preceded establishment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). By contrast, the number of CLS were low in mWAT and iWAT. Removal of inflamed eWAT after 12 weeks (eWATx group), followed by another 12 weeks of HFD feeding, resulted in significantly reduced NASH in eWATx. Inflammatory cell aggregates (-40%; P<0.05) and inflammatory genes (e.g., TNF\u03b1, -37%; P<0.05) were attenuated in livers of eWATx mice, whereas steatosis was not affected. Concomitantly, plasma concentrations of circulating proinflammatory mediators, viz. leptin and specific saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, were also reduced in the eWATx group. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention in NAFLD progression by removal of inflamed eWAT attenuates the development of NASH and reduces plasma levels of specific inflammatory mediators (cytokines and lipids). These data support the hypothesis that eWAT is causally involved in the pathogenesis of NASH."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence indicates that high uric acid (UA) is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome and drives the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. Although urate transporter-1 (URAT1), which is primarily expressed in the kidneys, plays a critical role in the development of hyperuricemia, its pathophysiological implication in NAFLD and insulin resistance remains unclear. We herein investigated the role and functional significance of URAT1 in diet-induced obese mice. METHODS: Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16-18 weeks or a normal-fat diet (NFD) were treated with or without a novel oral URAT1-selective inhibitor (dotinurad [50\u00a0mg/kg/day]) for another 4 weeks. RESULTS: We found that URAT1 was also expressed in the liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT) other than the kidneys. Dotinurad administration significantly ameliorated HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance. HFD markedly induced NAFLD, which was characterized by severe hepatic steatosis as well as the elevation of serum ALT activity and tissue inflammatory cytokine genes (chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) and tissue necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1)), all of which were attenuated by dotinurad. Similarly, HFD significantly increased URAT1 expression in BAT, resulting in lipid accumulation (whitening of BAT), and increased the production of tissue reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were reduced by dotinurad via UCP1 activation. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a novel URAT1-selective inhibitor, dotinurad, ameliorates insulin resistance by attenuating hepatic steatosis and promoting rebrowning of lipid-rich BAT in HFD-induced obese mice. URAT1 serves as a key regulator of the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome and may be a new therapeutic target for insulin-resistant individuals, particularly those with concomitant NAFLD."

                "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as vinyl chloride (VC), can be directly toxic at high concentrations. However, we have shown that 'nontoxic' exposures to VC and its metabolite chloroethanol (CE) enhances experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), suggesting an unpredicted interaction. Importantly, VOC exposure has been identified as a potential risk factor for the development of obesity and its sequelae in humans. As there is a known axis between adipose and hepatic tissue in NAFLD, the impact of CE on white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation and lipolysis was investigated. Mice were administered CE (or vehicle) once, after 10\u00a0weeks of being fed high-fat or low-fat diet (LFD). CE significantly enhanced hepatic steatosis and inflammation caused by HFD. HFD significantly increased the size of epididymal fat pads, which was enhanced by CE. The relative size of adipocyte lipid droplets increased by HFD\u00a0+\u00a0CE, which was also correlated with increased expression of lipid-associated proteins (e.g., PLINs). CE also enhanced HFD-induced indices of WAT inflammation, and ER stress. Hepatic-derived circulating FGF21, a major modulator of WAT lipolysis, which is hypothesized to thereby regulate hepatic steatosis, was significantly increased by CE in animals fed HFD. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that environmental toxicant exposure can exacerbate the severity of NAFLD/NASH, involving the liver-adipose axis in this process. Specifically, CE enhances local inflammation and alters lipid metabolism and WAT-mediated hepatic steatosis due to changes in WAT lipolysis."

                "abstract": "Background: Recent research has shown that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F1 (Adgrf1; also known as GPR110; PGR19; KPG_012; hGPCR36) is an oncogene. The evidence is mainly based on high expression of Adgrf1 in numerous cancer types, and knockdown Adgrf1 can reduce the cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Adgrf1 is, however, mostly expressed in the liver of healthy individuals. The function of Adgrf1 in liver has not been revealed. Interestingly, expression level of hepatic Adgrf1 is dramatically decreased in obese subjects. Here, the research examined whether Adgrf1 has a role in liver metabolism. Methods: We used recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery system, and antisense oligonucleotide was used to manipulate the hepatic Adgrf1 expression level in diet-induced obese mice to investigate the role of Adgrf1 in hepatic steatosis. The clinical relevance was examined using transcriptome profiling and archived biopsy specimens of liver tissues from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with different degree of fatty liver. Results: The expression of Adgrf1 in the liver was directly correlated to fat content in the livers of both obese mice and NAFLD patients. Stearoyl-coA desaturase 1 (Scd1), a crucial enzyme in hepatic de novo lipogenesis, was identified as a downstream target of Adgrf1 by RNA-sequencing analysis. Treatment with the liver-specific Scd1 inhibitor MK8245 and specific shRNAs against Scd1 in primary hepatocytes improved the hepatic steatosis of Adgrf1-overexpressing mice and lipid profile of hepatocytes, respectively. Conclusions: These results indicate Adgrf1 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism through controlling the expression of Scd1. Downregulation of Adgrf1 expression can potentially serve as a protective mechanism to stop the overaccumulation of fat in the liver in obese subjects. Overall, the above findings not only reveal a new mechanism regulating the progression of NAFLD, but also proposed a novel therapeutic approach to combat NAFLD by targeting Adgrf1.

However, the role of GSDMD in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear. We investigated the role of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis. METHODS: Human liver tissues from patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and control individuals were obtained to evaluate GSDMD expression. Gsdmd knockout (Gsdmd-/-) mice, obese db/db mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were fed with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) or control diet to induce steatohepatitis. The Gsdmd-/- and WT mice were also used in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model. In addition, Alb-Cre mice were administered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector that expressed the gasdermin-N domain (AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N) and were fed with either MCD or control diet for 10\u202fdays. RESULTS: GSDMD and its pyroptosis-inducing fragment GSDMD-N were upregulated in liver tissues of human NAFLD/NASH. Importantly, hepatic GSDMD-N protein levels were significantly higher in human NASH and correlated with the NAFLD activity score and fibrosis. GSDMD-N remained a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH. MCD-fed Gsdmd-/- mice exhibit decreased severity of steatosis and inflammation compared with WT littermates. GSDMD was associated with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 [CCL2]) and persistent activation of the NF-\u0138B signaling pathway. Gsdmd-/- mice showed lower steatosis, mainly because of reduced expression of the lipogenic gene Srebp1c (Srebf1) and upregulated expression of lipolytic genes, including Ppar\u03b1, Aco [Klk15], Lcad [Acadl], Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14. Alb-Cre mice administered with AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N showed significantly aggravated steatohepatitis when fed with MCD diet. CONCLUSION: As an executor of pyroptosis, GSDMD plays a key role in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis, by controlling cytokine secretion, NF-\u0138B activation, and lipogenesis. LAY SUMMARY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become one of the most feared chronic liver diseases, because it is the most rapidly growing indication for adult liver transplantation and a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms involved in the transformation of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis remain unclear. Herein, we show that gasdermin D driven pyroptosis is prominent in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and gasdermin-N domain remains a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH. Gasdermin D plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NASH by regulating lipogenesis, the inflammatory response, and the NF-\u0138B signaling pathway, revealing potential treatment targets for NASH in humans."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease. Activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been implicated in the progression of NAFLD and proposed as a therapeutic target; however, the effects of Hh signaling inhibition have not been studied in humans with germline mutations that affect this pathway. METHODS: Patients with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a disorder associated with germline mutations disrupting Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, were clinically evaluated for NAFLD. A combined mouse model of Hh signaling attenuation (Gli2 heterozygous null: Gli2+/-) and diet-induced NAFLD was used to examine aspects of NAFLD and hepatic gene expression profiles, including molecular markers of hepatic fibrosis and inflammation. RESULTS: Patients with HPE had a higher prevalence of liver steatosis compared to the general population, independent of obesity. Exposure of Gli2+/- mice to fatty liver-inducing diets resulted in increased liver steatosis compared to wild-type mice. Similar to humans, this effect was independent of obesity in the mutant mice and was associated with decreased expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes, and increased expression of PPAR\u03b3, a potent anti-fibrogenic and anti-inflammatory regulator. Interestingly, tumor suppressors p53 and p16INK4 were found to be downregulated in the Gli2+/- mice exposed to a high-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that germline mutations disrupting Hh signaling promotes liver steatosis, independent of obesity, with reduced fibrosis. While Hh signaling inhibition has been associated with a better NAFLD prognosis, further studies are required to evaluate the long-term effects of mutations affecting this pathway. Lay summary: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excess fat deposition in the liver predominantly due to high calorie intake and a sedentary lifestyle. NAFLD progression is usually accompanied by activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway leading to fibrous buildup (scar tissue) and inflammation of the liver tissue. For the first time patients with holoprosencephaly, a disease caused by SHH signaling mutations, are shown to have increased liver steatosis independent of obesity. This observation was recapitulated in a mouse model of attenuated SHH signaling that also showed increased liver steatosis but with decreased fibrosis and inflammation. While SHH inhibition is associated with a good NAFLD prognosis, this increase in liver fat accumulation in the context of SHH signaling inhibition must be studied prospectively to evaluate its long-term effects, especially in individuals with Western-type dietary habits."

                "abstract": "Given the increasing prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, identification of intrinsic molecular programs responsible for ensuring fuel homeostasis and preventing metabolic disease is needed. We investigated whether the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1), a major regulator of energy metabolism, plays a role in lipid homeostasis and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in response to chronic high-fat diet (HFD) consumption and long-term fasting. Systemic ablation of ERR\u03b1 in mice demonstrated clear beneficial effects for loss of ERR\u03b1 function in protection from HFD-provoked body weight gain manifested not only from a reduction in white adipose tissue stores but also from an impediment in intrahepatic lipid accumulation. The prevention of HFD-induced NAFLD in ERR\u03b1-null mice was underscored by transcriptional repression of de novo lipogenesis, which was upregulated in wild-type mice, a known contributing factor to lipid-stimulated hepatic steatosis. Surprisingly, given these findings, ERR\u03b1 deficiency had no significant impact on the degree of fasting-induced NAFLD, involving the mobilization of adipocyte triglyceride (TG) stores into the liver. However, the presence of ERR\u03b1 was essential for acute refeeding-mediated reversal of fasting-induced hepatic TG accretion, underpinned by impaired downregulation of adipose TG lipolysis and reduced hepatic mitochondrial oxidative activity. Taken together, the regulation of lipid handling by ERR\u03b1 depended on the nutritional state, suggesting that negative modulation of ERR\u03b1 activity could be envisaged to prevent lipid-induced NAFLD, whereas inducing its activity would be useful to treat and reverse the instilled disease."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with type 2 diabetes may more easily progress towards severe forms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Although the Wnt effector transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is closely associated with type 2 diabetes risk, the role of TCF7L2 in NAFLD development remains unclear. Here, we investigated how changes in TCF7L2 expression in the liver affects hepatic lipid metabolism based on the major risk factors of NAFLD development. METHODS: Tcf7l2 was selectively ablated in the liver of C57BL/6N mice by inducing the albumin (Alb) promoter to recombine Tcf7l2 alleles floxed at exon 5 (liver-specific Tcf7l2-knockout [KO] mice: Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f). Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f and their wild-type (Tcf7l2f/f) littermates were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) for 22 weeks to reproduce NAFLD/NASH. Mice were refed a standard chow diet or an HCD to stimulate de novo lipogenesis (DNL) or fed an HFD to provide exogenous fatty acids. We analysed glucose and insulin sensitivity, metabolic respiration, mRNA expression profiles, hepatic triglyceride (TG), hepatic DNL, selected hepatic metabolites, selected plasma metabolites and liver histology. RESULTS: Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f essentially exhibited increased lipogenic genes, but there were no changes in hepatic lipid content in mice fed a normal chow diet. However, following 22 weeks of diet-induced NAFLD/NASH conditions, liver steatosis was exacerbated owing to preferential metabolism of carbohydrate over fat. Indeed, hepatic Tcf7l2 deficiency enhanced liver lipid content in a manner that was dependent on the duration and amount of exposure to carbohydrates, owing to cell-autonomous increases in hepatic DNL. Mechanistically, TCF7L2 regulated the transcriptional activity of Mlxipl (also known as ChREBP) by modulating O-GlcNAcylation and protein content of carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), and targeted Srebf1 (also called SREBP1) via miRNA (miR)-33-5p in hepatocytes. Eventually, restoring TCF7L2 expression at the physiological level in the liver of Alb-Cre;Tcf7l2f/f mice alleviated liver steatosis without altering body composition under both acute and chronic HCD conditions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In mice, loss of hepatic Tcf7l2 contributes to liver steatosis by inducing preferential metabolism of carbohydrates via DNL activation. Therefore, TCF7L2 could be a promising regulator of the NAFLD associated with high-carbohydrate diets and diabetes since TCF7L2 deficiency may lead to development of NAFLD by promoting utilisation of excess glucose pools through activating DNL.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), a sweetener rich in glucose and fructose, is nowadays widely used in beverages and processed foods; its consumption has been correlated to the emergence and progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which HFCS impacts hepatic metabolism remain scarce, especially in the context of obesity. Besides, the majority of current studies focuses either on the detrimental role of fructose in hepatic steatosis or compare separately the additive impact of fructose versus glucose in high fat diet-induced NAFLD. AIM: By engaging combined omics approaches, we sought to characterize the role of HFCS in obesity-associated NAFLD and reveal molecular processes, which mediate the exaggeration of steatosis under these conditions. METHODS: Herein, C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal-fat-diet (ND), a high-fat-diet (HFD) or a HFD supplemented with HFCS (HFD-HFCS) and upon examination of their metabolic and NAFLD phenotype, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic analyses were conducted to identify HFCS-related molecular alterations of the hepatic metabolic landscape in obesity. RESULTS: Although HFD and HFD-HFCS mice displayed comparable obesity, HFD-HFCS mice showed aggravation of hepatic steatosis, as analysis of the lipid droplet area in liver sections revealed (12,15\u00a0% of total section area in HFD vs 22,35\u00a0% in HFD-HFCS), increased NAFLD activity score (3,29 in HFD vs 4,86 in HFD-HFCS) and deteriorated hepatic insulin resistance, as compared to the HFD mice. Besides, the hepatic proteome of HFD-HFCS mice was characterized by a marked upregulation of 5 core proteins implicated in de novo lipogenesis (DNL), while an increased phosphatidyl-cholines(PC)/phosphatidyl-ethanolamines(PE) ratio (2.01 in HFD vs 3.04 in HFD-HFCS) was observed in the livers of HFD-HFCS versus HFD mice. Integrated analysis of the omics datasets indicated that Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle overactivation is likely contributing towards the intensification of steatosis during HFD-HFCS-induced NAFLD. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that HFCS significantly contributes to steatosis aggravation during obesity-related NAFLD, likely deriving from DNL upregulation, accompanied by TCA cycle overactivation and deteriorated hepatic insulin resistance."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi formula (FTZ) of which a patented preparation of Chinese herbal medicine has been well documented with significant clinical curative effect for hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Because of the complexity of the chemical constituents of Chinese herbal formulas, the holistic pharmacological mechanism of FTZ acting on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the pharmacological efficacy and mechanism of FTZ in the treatment of T2DM accompanied by NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology and validation in minipigs were used in this study. First, potential bioactive compounds of FTZ were identified by the traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology technology platform (TCMSP). Then, targets of compounds were gathered using DrugBank, SwissTargetPrediction and TCMSP, while targets for T2DM and NAFLD were collected from CTD (compounds-targets-diseases network) and GeneCards. Common targets were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on T2DM with NAFLD. In addition, crucial targets were chosen by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and contribution to compound-therapeutic targets in T2DM with the NAFLD network. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to analyze the metabolism-related signaling pathways affected by FTZ. Candidate patterns selected by network pharmacology were tested in the minipigs model of T2DM with NAFLD. Measurements of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting insulin (FINS) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the blood and the expression levels of proteins, including PI3K-AKT and HIF-1\u03b1, in the livers of the minipigs were followed by the administration of FTZ. RESULTS: A total of 116 active compounds and 82 potential targets related to T2DM and NAFLD were found. Pathway and functional enrichment analysis showed that FTZ mainly regulates metabolism-related pathways, including PI3K-AKT, HIF-1\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 and MAPK. Animal experiments showed that FTZ treatment significantly reduced the serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C and FBG, increased serum levels of HDL-C, ameliorated systemic insulin resistance (IR), and attenuated liver damage in minipigs with T2DM and NAFLD. FTZ treatment has an obviously favorable influence on hepatic steatosis and liver lipid accumulation in the histopathologic features of HE, Oil red O staining, and electron microscopy. Mechanistically, FTZ improved liver metabolism by increasing the phosphorylation of PI3K-AKT and decreasing the expression of HIF-1\u03b1. CONCLUSION: Network pharmacology was supported by experimental studies, which indicated that FTZ has demonstrated therapeutic benefits in T2DM and NAFLD by regulating the PI3K-AKT and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathways."

                "abstract": "Most studies regarding the beneficial effect of sulforaphane (SFN) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have focused on nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). But the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of SFN in the treatment of NAFLD remain controversial. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 is a member of the FGF family expressed mainly in liver but also in adipose tissue, muscle and pancreas, which functions as an endocrine factor and has been considered as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NAFLD. In the present study we investigated whether FGF21 was involved in the therapeutic effect of SFN against NAFLD. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to generate NAFLD and continued on the HFD for additional 6 weeks with or without SFN treatment. We showed that administration of SFN (0.56\u2009g/kg) significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis and inflammation in NAFLD mice, along with the improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, through suppressing the expression of proteins responsible for hepatic lipogenesis, while enhancing proteins for hepatic lipolysis and fatty acids oxidation. SFN administration significantly increased hepatic expression of FGFR1 and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in NAFLD mice, along with decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (the downstream of FGF21). HepG2 cells were treated in vitro with FFAs (palmitic acid and oleic acid) followed by different concentrations of SFN. We showed that the effects of SFN on FGF21 and FGFR1 protein expression were replicated in FFAs-treated HepG2 cells. Moreover, the increased FGFR1 protein occurred earlier than increased FGF21 protein. Interestingly, the rapid effect of SFN on FGFR1 protein was not regulated by the FGFR1 gene transcription. Knockdown of FGFR1 and p38 genes weakened SFN-reduced lipid deposition in FFAs-treated HepG2 cells. SFN administration in combination with rmFGF21 (1.5\u2009mg/kg, i.p., every other day) for 3 weeks further suppressed hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice. In conclusion, SFN ameliorates lipid metabolism disorders in NAFLD mice by upregulating FGF21/FGFR1 pathway. Our results verify that SFN may become a promising intervention to treat or relieve NAFLD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with mild cerebral dysfunction and cognitive decline, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains ambiguous. Using a diet-induced model of NAFLD and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (Mct1+/-) haploinsufficient mice, which resist high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, we investigated the hypothesis that NAFLD leads to an encephalopathy by altering cognition, behaviour, and cerebral physiology. We also proposed that global MCT1 downregulation offers cerebral protection. METHODS: Behavioural tests were performed in mice following 16 weeks of control diet (normal chow) or high-fat diet with high fructose/glucose in water. Tissue oxygenation, cerebrovascular reactivity, and cerebral blood volume were monitored under anaesthesia by multispectral optoacoustic tomography and optical fluorescence. Cortical mitochondrial oxygen consumption and respiratory capacities were measured using ex\u00a0vivo high-resolution respirometry. Microglial and astrocytic changes were evaluated by immunofluorescence and 3D reconstructions. Body composition was assessed using EchoMRI, and liver steatosis was confirmed by histology. RESULTS: NAFLD concomitant with obesity is associated with anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Low-grade brain tissue hypoxia was observed, likely attributed to the low-grade brain inflammation and decreased cerebral blood volume. It is also accompanied by microglial and astrocytic morphological and metabolic alterations (higher oxygen consumption), suggesting the early stages of an obesogenic diet-induced encephalopathy. Mct1 haploinsufficient mice, despite fat accumulation in adipose tissue, were protected from NAFLD and associated cerebral alterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of compromised brain health in obesity and NAFLD, emphasising the importance of the liver-brain axis. The protective effect of Mct1 haploinsufficiency points to this protein as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and/or treating NAFLD and the associated brain dysfunction. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study is focused on unravelling the pathophysiological mechanism by which cerebral dysfunction and cognitive decline occurs during NAFLD and exploring the potential of monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) as a novel preventive or therapeutic target. Our findings point to NAFLD as a serious health risk and its adverse impact on the brain as a potential global health system and economic burden. These results highlight the utility of Mct1 transgenic mice as a model for NAFLD and associated brain dysfunction and call for systematic screening by physicians for early signs of psychological symptoms, and an awareness by individuals at risk of these potential neurological effects. This study is expected to bring attention to the need for early diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, while having a direct impact on policies worldwide regarding the health risk associated with NAFLD, and its prevention and treatment."

            "abstract": "FoxO has been proposed to play a role in the promotion of insulin resistance, and inflammation. FoxO is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor that is a key mediator of generation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 in the liver. However, the detailed association of FoxO6 with insulin resistance and age-related inflammation has not been fully documented. Here, we showed that FoxO6 was elevated in the livers of aging rats and obese mice that exhibited insulin resistance. In addition, virus-mediated FoxO6 activation led to insulin resistance in mice with a notable increase in PAR2 and inflammatory signaling in the liver. On the other hand, FoxO6-KO mice showed reduced PAR2 signaling with a decrease in inflammatory cytokine expression and elevated insulin signaling. Because FoxO6 is closely associated with abnormal production of IL-1\u03b2 in the liver, we focused on the FoxO6/IL-1\u03b2/PAR2 axis to further examine mechanisms underlying FoxO6-mediated insulin resistance and inflammation in the liver. In vitro experiments showed that FoxO6 directly binds to and elevates IL-1\u03b2 expression. In turn, IL-1\u03b2 treatment elevated the protein levels of PAR2 with a significant decrease in hepatic insulin signaling, whereas PAR2-siRNA treatment abolished these effects. However, PAR2-siRNA treatment had no effect on IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by FoxO6, indicating that IL-1\u03b2 may not be downstream of PAR2. Taken together, we assume that FoxO6-mediated IL-1\u03b2 is involved in hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance via TF/PAR2 pathway in the liver."

                "abstract": "Obesity is accompanied by a low-grade inflammation state, characterized by increased proinflammatory cytokines levels such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). In this regard, there exists a lack of studies in hepatic tissue about the role of TNF\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the context of obesity and insulin resistance during the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of high-caloric feeding (HFD) (40% fat, for 16 weeks) on liver inflammation-induced apoptosis, insulin resistance, hepatic lipid accumulation and its progression toward nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in TNFR1 knock-out and wild-type mice. Mechanisms involved in HFD-derived IL-1\u03b2 release and impairment of insulin signaling are still unknown, so we determined whether IL-1\u03b2 affects liver insulin sensitivity and apoptosis through TNF\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNFR1)-dependent pathways. We showed that knocking out TNFR1 induces an enhanced IL-1\u03b2 plasmatic release upon HFD feed. This was correlated with higher hepatic and epididymal white adipose tissue mRNA levels. In vivo and in vitro assays confirmed an impairment in hepatic insulin signaling, in part due to IL-1\u03b2-induced decrease of AKT activation and diminution of IRS1 levels, followed by an increase in inflammation, macrophage (resident and recruited) accumulation, hepatocyte apoptotic process and finally hepatic damage. In addition, TNFR1 KO mice displayed higher levels of pro-fibrogenic markers. TNFR1 signaling disruption upon an HFD leads to an accelerated progression from simple steatosis to a more severe phenotype with many NASH features, pointing out a key role of TNFR1 in NAFLD progression."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Astragaloside (AGS) extracted from radix astragalin (Huangqi) has been considered to be beneficial to liver diseases. In this study, we examined the role played by AGS in alleviating hepatic fibrosis function via protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) mechanisms. We hypothesized that AGS affects PAR2 signaling pathway thereby improving hepatic function in rats with hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). We further hypothesized that AGS attenuates impaired hepatic function evoked by CCl4 to a greater degree in diabetic animals. METHODS: ELISA and Western Blot analysis were used to examine PAR2 signaling pathway in diabetic CCl4-rats and non-diabetic CCl4-rats. RESULTS: AGS inhibited the protein expression of PAR2 and its downstream pathway PKA and PKC\u025b in CCl4-rats. Notably, the effects of AGS were greater in CCl4-rats with diabetes. AGS also significantly attenuated the CCl4-induced upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 accompanied with decreases of collagenic parameters such as hexadecenoic acid, laminin and hydroxyproline. Additionally, AGS improved the CCl4-induced exaggerations of liver index and functions including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21, a marker of hepatic fibrosis, was increased in CCl4-rats and AGS inhibited increases in TGF-\u03b21 induced by CCl4. CONCLUSIONS: AGS alleviates hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting PAR2 signaling expression and its effects are largely enhanced in diabetic animals. Targeting one or more of these signaling molecules may present new opportunities for treatment and management of hepatic fibrosis; and results of our study are likely to shed light on strategies for application of AGS because it has potentially greater therapeutic effectiveness for hepatic fibrosis in diabetes."

                "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major cause of hepatic steatosis through increasing de novo lipogenesis. Forkhead box O6 (FoxO6) is a transcription factor mediating insulin signaling to glucose and lipid metabolism. Therefore, dysregulated FoxO6 is involved in hepatic lipogenesis. This study elucidated the role of FoxO6 in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo and in vitro. Hepatic ER stress responses and \u03b2-oxidation were monitored in mice overexpressed with constitutively active FoxO6 allele and FoxO6-null mice. For the in vitro study, liver cells overexpressing constitutively active FoxO6 and FoxO6-siRNA were treated with high glucose, and lipid metabolism alterations were measured. ER stress-induced FoxO6 activation suppressed hepatic \u03b2-oxidation in vivo. The expression and transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) were significantly decreased in the constitutively active FoxO6 allele. Otherwise, inhibiting \u03b2-oxidation genes were reduced in the FoxO6-siRNA and FoxO6-KO mice. Our data showed that the FoxO6-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was negatively regulated by insulin signaling. High glucose treatment as a hyperglycemia condition caused the expression of ER stress-inducible genes, which was deteriorated by FoxO6 activation in liver cells. However, high glucose-mediated ER stress suppressed \u03b2-oxidation gene expression through interactions between PPAR\u03b1 and FoxO6 corresponding to findings in the in vivo study-lipid catabolism is also regulated by FoxO6. Furthermore, insulin resistance suppressed b-oxidation through the interaction between FoxO6 and PPAR\u03b1 promotes hepatic steatosis, which, due to hyperglycemia-induced ER stress, impairs insulin signaling. KEY MESSAGES: Our original aims were to delineate the interrelation between the regulation of PPAR\u03b1 and the transcription factor FoxO6 pathway in relation to lipid metabolism at molecular levels. Evidence on high glucose promoted FoxO6 activation induced lipid accumulation in liver cells. The effect of PPAR\u03b1 activation of the insulin signaling. FoxO6 plays a pivotal role in hepatic lipid accumulation through inactivation of PPAR\u03b1 in FoxO6-overexpression mice."

                "abstract": "Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an antiinflammatory protein that circulates at high levels in the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic studies of PEDF knockout (KO) mice were conducted to investigate the relationship between PEDF, inflammatory markers, and metabolic homeostasis. Male PEDF KO mice demonstrated a phenotype consisting of increased adiposity, glucose intolerance, and elevated serum levels of metabolites associated with the metabolic syndrome. Genome expression analysis revealed an increase in IL-1\u03b2 signaling in the livers of PEDF KO mice that was accompanied by impaired IRS and Akt signaling. In human hepatocytes, PEDF blocked the effects of an IL-1\u03b2 challenge by suppressing activation of the inflammatory mediator c-Jun N-terminal kinase while restoring Akt signaling. RNA interference of PEDF in human hepatocytes was permissive for c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and decreased Akt signaling. A metabolomics profile identified elevated circulating levels of tricarboxyclic acid cycle intermediates including succinate, an inducer of IL-1\u03b2, in PEDF KO mice. Succinate-dependent IL-1\u03b2 expression was blocked by PEDF in PEDF KO, but not wild-type hepatocytes. In vivo, PEDF restoration reduced hyperglycemia and improved hepatic insulin signaling in PEDF KO mice. These findings identify elevated PEDF as a homeostatic mechanism in the human metabolic syndrome. "

This inflammation impairs insulin secretion by inducing beta-cell apoptosis. Recent evidence has suggested that in obesity-induced inflammation, IL-1\u03b2 plays a key role in causing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. DESIGN AND METHODS: To further investigate the pathophysiological role of IL-1\u03b2 in causing insulin resistance, the inhibitory effects of IL-1\u03b2 on several insulin-dependent metabolic processes in vitro has been neutralized by XOMA 052. The role IL-1\u03b2 plays in insulin resistance in adipose tissue was assessed using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and several parameters involved in insulin signaling and lipid metabolism were examined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: IL-1\u03b2 inhibited insulin-induced activation of Akt phosphorylation, glucose transport, and fatty acid uptake. IL-1\u03b2 also blocked insulin-mediated downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 expression. Co-preincubation of IL-1\u03b2 with XOMA 052 neutralized nearly all of these inhibitory effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These studies provide evidence, therefore, that IL-1\u03b2 is a key proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in inducing insulin resistance. These studies also suggest that the monoclonal antibody XOMA 052 may be a possible therapeutic to effectively neutralize cytokine-mediated insulin resistance in adipose tissue."

However, the correlation between FoxO6 and NF-\u03baB during aging has not fully been explored.The main purpose of the present study was to elucidate mechanisms underlying the protective role of FoxO6 in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under potent pro-inflammatory conditions induced by LPS. Initial experimentation revealed that reduced FoxO6 activity during aging was caused by its phosphorylation, which suppressed its transcriptional activity in aged livers. Transfection with FoxO6-wt virus and FoxO6-siRNA in HepG2 cells revealed that FoxO6 phosphorylation by LPS leads to NF-\u03baB activation via Akt and Pak1 pathways. Furthermore, Pak1 activity was increased in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase independent manner, and LPS-induced FoxO6 phosphorylation and FoxO6 inactivation were Pak1-dependent in nuclear fractions of cells. Further revealed Pak1 phosphorylation by LPS permitted interaction between FoxO6 and Akt.Current study suggests FoxO6 phosphorylation facilitates the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB via Akt and Pak1 pathways induced by LPS in aged rats."

                "abstract": "Excessive production of triglyceride-rich very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL-TG) contributes to hypertriglyceridemia in obesity and type 2 diabetes. To understand the underlying mechanism, we studied hepatic regulation of VLDL-TG production by (forkhead box O6) FoxO6, a forkhead transcription factor that integrates insulin signaling to hepatic metabolism. We showed that transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active FoxO6 allele developed hypertriglyceridemia, culminating in elevated VLDL-TG levels and impaired postprandial TG clearance. This effect resulted in part from increased hepatic VLDL-TG production. We recapitulated these findings in cultured HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes, demonstrating that FoxO6 promoted hepatic VLDL-TG secretion. This action correlated with the ability of FoxO6 to stimulate hepatic production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a molecular chaperone that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in VLDL-TG assembly and secretion. FoxO6 was shown to bind to the MTP promoter and stimulate MTP promoter activity in HepG2 cells. This effect was inhibited by insulin, consistent with the ability of insulin to promote FoxO6 phosphorylation and disable FoxO6 DNA-binding activity. Mutations of the FoxO6 target site within the MTP promoter abrogated FoxO6-mediated induction of MTP promoter activity. Hepatic FoxO6 expression became deregulated in insulin-resistant mice with obesity and type 2 diabetes. FoxO6 inhibition in insulin-resistant liver suppressed hepatic MTP expression and curbed VLDL-TG overproduction, contributing to the amelioration of hypertriglyceridemia in obese and diabetic db/db mice. These results characterize FoxO6 as an important signaling molecule upstream of MTP for regulating hepatic VLDL-TG production. "

                "abstract": "Failure to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis is a major mechanism contributing to fasting hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and, along with steatosis, is the hallmark of hepatic insulin resistance. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation in multiple tissues, and hepatic inflammation is mechanistically linked to both steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we delineate a role for coagulation signaling via tissue factor (TF) and proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in obesity-mediated hepatic inflammation, steatosis, and gluconeogenesis. In diet-induced obese mice, TF tail signaling independent of PAR2 drives CD11b(+)CD11c(+) hepatic macrophage recruitment, and TF-PAR2 signaling contributes to the accumulation of hepatic CD8(+) T cells. Transcripts of key pathways of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and inflammatory cytokines were reduced in high-fat diet-fed mice that lack the cytoplasmic domain of TF (F3) (TF(\u0394CT)) or that are deficient in PAR2 (F2rl1), as well as by pharmacological inhibition of TF-PAR2 signaling in diet-induced obese mice. These gluconeogenic, lipogenic, and inflammatory pathway transcripts were similarly reduced in response to genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TF-PAR2 signaling in hematopoietic cells and were mechanistically associated with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). These findings indicate that hematopoietic TF-PAR2 signaling plays a pivotal role in the hepatic inflammatory responses, steatosis, and hepatic insulin resistance that lead to systemic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in obesity.

                "abstract": "Long-term exposure to ultraviolet irradiation to skin leads to deleterious intracellular effects, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammatory responses, causing accelerated skin aging. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased expression and activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and Akt is observed in keratinocyte proliferation, suggesting their potential regulatory role in skin photoaging. However, the specific underlying molecular mechanism of PAR2 and the Akt/NF-\u03baB/FoxO6-mediated signaling pathway is not clearly defined. In this study, we first used the UVB-irradiated photoaged skin of hairless mice and observed an increase in PAR2 and G\u03b1q expression and PI3-kinase/Akt, NF-\u03baB, and suppressed FoxO6. Consequently, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and decreased levels of antioxidant MnSOD was observed. Next, to investigate PAR2-specific roles in inflammation and oxidative stress, we used photoaged hairless mice topically applied with PAR2 antagonist GB83 and photoaged PAR2 knockout mice. PAR2 inhibition and deletion significantly suppressed inflammatory and oxidative stress levels, which were associated with decreased IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels and increased MnSOD levels, respectively. Furthermore, NF-\u03baB phosphorylation and decreased FoxO6 was reduced by PAR2 inhibition and deletion in vivo. To confirm the in vivo results, we conducted PAR2 knockdown and overexpression in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. In PAR2 knockdown cells by si-PAR2 treatment, it suppressed Akt/NF-\u03baB and increased FoxO6, whereas PAR2 overexpression reversed these effects and subsequently modulated proinflammatory target genes. Collectively, our data define that PAR2 induces oxidative stress and inflammation through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB (Ser536) and FoxO6 (Ser184), which could be a critical upstream regulatory mechanism in ROS-mediated inflammatory response."

Our goal is to decipher the molecular linkage between proinflammatory cytokine production and insulin resistance in macrophages. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined cytokine profiles in cultured macrophages and identified interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 gene as a potential target of FoxO1, a key transcription factor that mediates insulin action on gene expression. We studied the mechanism by which FoxO1 mediates insulin-dependent regulation of IL-1\u03b2 expression in cultured macrophages and correlated FoxO1 activity in peritoneal macrophages with IL-1\u03b2 production profiles in mice with low-grade inflammation or insulin resistance. RESULTS: FoxO1 selectively promoted IL-1\u03b2 production in cultured macrophages. This effect correlated with the ability of FoxO1 to bind and enhance IL-1\u03b2 promoter activity. Mutations of the FoxO1 binding site within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter abolished FoxO1 induction of IL-1\u03b2 expression.

In nonstimulated macrophages, FoxO1 remained inert with benign effects on IL-1\u03b2 expression. In response to inflammatory stimuli, FoxO1 activity was augmented because of an impaired ability of insulin to phosphorylate FoxO1 and promote its nuclear exclusion. This effect along with nuclear factor-\u03baB acted to stimulate IL-1\u03b2 production in activated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: FoxO1 signaling through nuclear factor-\u03baB plays an important role in coupling proinflammatory cytokine production to insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), is known to exert a protective role in hepatic damage caused by viruses, alcohol, autoimmunity and a number of experimental aggressors. Recently, a protective role for IL-10 has also been proposed in diet-induced hepatic dysfunction. However, studies about the mechanisms involved in this process are controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of endogenous IL-10 in the development of hepatic insulin resistance, associated with diet-induced fatty liver disease. METHODS: Male Swiss mice treated for eight weeks with a high-fat diet became diabetic and developed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is characterized by increased hepatic fat deposition and liver infiltration by F4/80 positive cells. This was accompanied by an increased hepatic expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta and IL-10, and by an impaired insulin signal transduction through the insulin receptor/IRS1-IRS2/PI3-kinase/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway. RESULTS: Upon endogenous IL-10 inhibition for 5 days, using two distinct methods, a neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibody and an antisense oligonucleotide against IL-10, increased hepatic expression of the inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta and F4/80 was observed. This was accompanied by a significant negative modulation of insulin signal transduction through insulin receptor/IRS1-IRS2/PI3-kinase/Akt/FOXO1, and by the stimulation of hepatic signaling proteins involved in gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in an animal model of diet-induced fatty liver disease, the inhibition of IL-10 promotes the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, the worsening of insulin signaling and the activation of gluconeogenic and lipidogenic pathways."

                "abstract": "Aging is associated with increased vulnerability to inflammatory challenge. However, the effects of altered inflammatory response on the metabolic status of tissues or organs are not well documented. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of the inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 pathway is accompanied with an increased inflammatory response and abnormal lipid accumulation in livers of aged rats. To monitor the effects of aging on LPS-induced inflammation, we administered LPS (2 mg kg(-1) ) to young (6-month old) and aged (24-month old) rats and found abnormal lipid metabolism in only aged rats with increased lipid accumulation in the liver. This lipid accumulation in the liver was due to the dysregulation of PPAR\u03b1 and SREBP1c. We also observed severe liver inflammation in aged rats as indicated by increased ALT levels in serum and increased Kupffer cells in the liver. Importantly, among many inflammation-associated factors, the aged rat liver showed chronically increased IL-1\u03b2 production. Increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 were caused by the upregulation of caspase-1 activity and inflammasome activation. In vitro studies with HepG2 cells demonstrated that treatment with IL-1\u03b2 significantly induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes through the regulation of PPAR\u03b1 and SREBP1c. In summary, we demonstrated that LPS-induced liver inflammation and lipid accumulation were associated with a chronically overactive inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 pathway in aged rat livers. Based on the present findings, we propose a mechanism of aging-associated progression of steatohepatitis induced by endotoxin, delineating a pathogenic role of the inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 pathway involved in lipid accumulation in the liver."

Unlike the other three members of the FoxO family, FoxO6 has garnered considerably less attention because of earlier reports that FoxO6 expression was limited to the brain. Recent data indicate that FoxO6 is produced in the liver of both rodents and humans. Hepatic FoxO6 activity, which remains at low basal levels in fed states, is markedly induced in fasted mice. FoxO6 activity becomes abnormally higher in the liver of mice with dietary obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genetically engineered mice with elevated FoxO6 activity in the liver exhibit prediabetes, culminating in the development of glucose intolerance, fasting hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Conversely, inhibition of FoxO6 activity in the insulin-resistant liver results in a reduction in fasting hyperglycemia, contributing to the amelioration of hyperinsulinemia in T2D mice. These new data suggest that FoxO6 is an important regulator of hepatic glucose metabolism in response to insulin or physiological cues. Insulin inhibits FoxO6 activity by promoting its phosphorylation and disabling its activity in the nucleus without altering its subcellular distribution via a mechanism that is distinct from other members of the FoxO subfamily. In this article, we comprehensively review the role of FoxO6 in glucose metabolism in health and disease. We also address whether FoxO6 dysregulation is a contributing factor for the pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and discuss whether FoxO6 is a potential therapeutic target for improving fasting hyperglycemia in T2D.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protease-activated protein-2 (PAR2) has been reported to regulate hepatic insulin resistance condition in type 2 diabetes mice. However, the mechanism of lipid metabolism through PAR2 in obesity mice have not yet been examined. In liver, Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) activity induces peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), leading to accumulation of lipids and hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia significantly influence hepatic steatoses, but the mechanisms underlying PAR2 signaling are complex and have not yet been elucidated. METHODS: To examine the modulatory action of FoxO1 and its altered interaction with PPAR\u03b3, we utilized db/db mice and PAR2-knockout (KO) mice administered with high-fat diet (HFD). RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that PAR2 was overexpressed and regulated downstream gene expressions in db/db but not in db+ mice. The interaction between PAR2/\u03b2-arrestin and Akt was also greater in db/db mice. The Akt inhibition increased FoxO1 activity and subsequently PPAR\u03b3 gene in the livers that led to hepatic lipid accumulation. Our data showed that FoxO1 was negatively controlled by Akt signaling and consequently, the activity of a major lipogenesis-associated transcription factors such as PPAR\u03b3 increased, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation through the PAR2 pathway under hyperglycemic conditions in mice. Furthermore, the association between PPAR\u03b3 and FoxO1 was increased in hepatic steatosis condition in db/db mice. However, HFD-fed PAR2-KO mice showed suppressed FoxO1-induced hepatic lipid accumulation compared with HFD-fed control groups. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results provide evidence that the interaction of FoxO1 with PPAR\u03b3 promotes hepatic steatosis in mice. This might be due to defects in PAR2/\u03b2-arrestin-mediated Akt signaling in diabetic and HFD-fed mice."

                "abstract": "The forkhead box O family consists of FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 proteins in mammals. Expressed ubiquitously in the body, the four FoxO isoforms share in common the amino DNA-binding domain, known as 'forkhead box' domain. They mediate the inhibitory action of insulin or insulin-like growth factor on key functions involved in cell metabolism, growth, differentiation, oxidative stress, senescence, autophagy and aging. Genetic mutations in FoxO genes or abnormal expression of FoxO proteins are associated with metabolic disease, cancer or altered lifespan in humans and animals. Of the FoxO family, FoxO6 is the least characterized member and is shown to play pivotal roles in the liver, skeletal muscle and brain. Altered FoxO6 expression is associated with the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, dietary obesity and type 2 diabetes and risk of neurodegeneration disease. FoxO6 is evolutionally divergent from other FoxO isoforms. FoxO6 mediates insulin action on target genes in a mechanism that is fundamentally different from other FoxO members. Here, we focus our review on the role of FoxO6, in contrast with other FoxO isoforms, in health and disease. We review the distinctive mechanism by which FoxO6 integrates insulin signaling to hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We highlight the importance of FoxO6 dysregulation in the dual pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetes. We review the role of FoxO6 in memory consolidation and its contribution to neurodegeneration disease and aging. We discuss the potential therapeutic option of pharmacological FoxO6 inhibition for improving glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetes."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Insulin resistance and poor glycemic control are key drivers of the development of NAFLD and have recently been shown to be associated with fibrosis progression in NASH. However, the underlying mechanisms involving dysfunctional glucose metabolism and relationship with NAFLD/NASH progression remain poorly understood. We set out to determine whether protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a sensor of extracellular inflammatory and coagulation proteases, links NAFLD and NASH with liver glucose metabolism. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that hepatic expression of PAR2 increases in patients and mice with diabetes and NAFLD/NASH. Mechanistic studies using whole-body and liver-specific PAR2-knockout mice reveal that hepatic PAR2 plays an unexpected role in suppressing glucose internalization, glycogen storage, and insulin signaling through a bifurcating Gq -dependent mechanism. PAR2 activation downregulates the major glucose transporter of liver, GLUT2, through Gq -MAPK-FoxA3 and inhibits insulin-Akt signaling through Gq -calcium-CaMKK2 pathways. Therapeutic dosing with a liver-homing pepducin, PZ-235, blocked PAR2-Gq signaling and afforded significant improvements in glycemic indices and HbA1c levels in severely diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides evidence that PAR2 is a major regulator of liver glucose homeostasis and a potential target for the treatment of diabetes and NASH."

Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation in type 2 diabetes is a key component in the development of insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated whether CYP epoxygenase expression and exogenous EETs can attenuate insulin resistance in diabetic db/db mice and in cultured hepatic cells (HepG2). In vivo, CYP2J2 expression and the accompanying increase in EETs attenuated insulin resistance, as determined by plasma glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. CYP2J2 expression reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in liver, including CRP, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1, and decreased the infiltration of macrophages in liver. CYP2J2 expression also decreased activation of proinflammatory signaling cascades by decreasing NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation in hepatocytes. Interestingly, CYP2J2 expression and exogenous EET treatment increased glucose uptake and activated the insulin-signaling cascade both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that CYP2J2 metabolites play a role in glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, CYP2J2 expression upregulated PPAR\u03b3, which has been shown to induce adipogenesis, which attenuates dyslipidemias observed in diabetes. All of the findings suggest that CYP2J2 expression attenuates the diabetic phenotype and insulin resistance via inhibition of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways and activation of PPAR\u03b3. "

                "abstract": "Inflammation is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Proinflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue in obesity could alter insulin signaling and action. Recent studies have shown a relationship between IL-1beta level and metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. However, the ability of IL-1beta to alter insulin signaling and action remains to be explored. We demonstrated that IL-1beta slightly increased Glut 1 translocation and basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Importantly, we found that prolonged IL-1beta treatment reduced the insulin-induced glucose uptake, whereas an acute treatment had no effect. Chronic treatment with IL-1beta slightly decreased the expression of Glut 4 and markedly inhibited its translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. This inhibitory effect was due to a decrease in the amount of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 but not IRS-2 expression in both 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes. The decrease in IRS-1 amount resulted in a reduction in its tyrosine phosphorylation and the alteration of insulin-induced protein kinase B activation and AS160 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK totally inhibited IL-1beta-induced down-regulation of IRS-1 mRNA. Moreover, IRS-1 protein expression and insulin-induced protein kinase B activation, AS160 phosphorylation, and Glut 4 translocation were partially recovered after treatment with the ERK inhibitor. These results demonstrate that IL-1beta reduces IRS-1 expression at a transcriptional level through a mechanism that is ERK dependent and at a posttranscriptional level independently of ERK activation. By targeting IRS-1, IL-1beta is capable of impairing insulin signaling and action, and could thus participate in concert with other cytokines, in the development of insulin resistance in adipocytes."

Here, we examined the mechanistic links underlying this apparent paradox. The LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr)(-/-)xLcat(-/-) mouse model and age- and sex-matched Ldlr(-/-)xLcat(+/+) littermates, both in C57Bl/6 background, were employed. Studies of hepatic insulin signal transduction showed an upregulation of hepatic Irs2 mRNA level (5.3-fold, P = 0.02), IRS-2 protein mass level (1.5-fold, P = 0.009) and pIRS-2 (1.8-fold. P = 0.02) in the Ldlr(-/-)xLcat(-/-) mice. There was a 1.2-fold increase in pAkt (P = 0.03) with a nonsignificant change in total Akt. We observed a significant shift in its downstream transcription factor FoxO-1 to the cytosolic compartment (2.3-fold increase in cytosolic/nuclear ratio, P = 0.04). We also observed a significant 3.1-fold increase in nuclear abundance of FoxA-2 mass (P = 0.017) and a 1.5-fold upregulation of its coactivator PGC-1beta (P = 0.002), the coordinated actions of which promotes hepatic TG production and beta-oxidation. Increased hepatic insulin signaling in the Ldlr(-/-)xLcat(-/-) mice was associated with an upregulation of the Tcfe3 gene (1.7-fold, P = 0.024), a selective downregulation of the Socs-1 gene by 60% (P = 0.01), and no change in PTP-1B protein mass. These data suggest that LCAT deficiency induces complex alterations in hepatic signal transduction cascades, which explain, at least in part, the observed enhanced insulin signaling in association with hepatic TG overproduction and reduced hepatic TG content."

                "abstract": "FoxO6, an identified factor, induces hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis during aging by activating hepatic lipoprotein secretion and lipogenesis leading to increased ApoC3 concentrations in the bloodstream. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying hepatic steatosis induced by elevated FoxO6 under hyperglycemic conditions remain intricate and require further elucidation. In order to delineate the regulatory pathway involving ApoC3 controlled by FoxO6 and its resultant functional impacts, we employed a spectrum of models including liver cell cultures, aged rats subjected to HFD, transgenic mice overexpressing FoxO6 (FoxO6-Tg), and FoxO6 knockout mice (FoxO6-KO). Our findings indicate that FoxO6 triggered ApoC3-driven lipid accumulation in the livers of aged rats on an HFD and in FoxO6-Tg, consequently leading to hepatic steatosis and hyperglycemia. Conversely, the absence of FoxO6 attenuated the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, resulting in diminished hepatic lipid accumulation and mitigated hyperlipidemia in murine models. Additionally, the upregulation of FoxO6 due to elevated glucose levels led to increased ApoC3 expression, consequently instigating cellular triglyceride mediated lipid accumulation. The transcriptional activation of FoxO6 induced by both the HFD and high glucose levels resulted in hepatic steatosis by upregulating ApoC3 and genes associated with gluconeogenesis in aged rats and liver cell cultures. Our conclusions indicate that the upregulation of ApoC3 by FoxO6 promotes the development of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in vivo, and in vitro. Taken together, our findings underscore the significance of FoxO6 in driving hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis specifically under hyperglycemic states by enhancing the expression of ApoC3 in aged rats."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have changed the paradigm of cancer therapies. However, anti-tumor response of the ICB is insufficient for many patients and limited to specific tumor types. Despite many preclinical and clinical studies to understand the mechanism of anti-tumor efficacy of ICB, the mechanism is not completely understood. Harnessing preclinical tumor models is one way to understand the mechanism of treatment response. METHODS: In order to delineate the mechanisms of anti-tumor activity of ICB in preclinical syngeneic tumor models, we selected two syngeneic murine colorectal cancer models based on in vivo screening for sensitivity with anti-PD-1 therapy. We performed tumor-immune profiling of the two models to identify the potential mechanism for anti-PD-1 response. RESULTS: We performed in vivo screening for anti-PD-1 therapy across 23 syngeneic tumor models and found that CT-26 and Colon 26, which are murine colorectal carcinoma derived from BALB/c mice, showed different sensitivity to anti-PD-1. CT-26 tumor mice were more sensitive to the anti-PD-1 antibody than Colon 26, while both models show similarly sensitivity to anti-CTLA4 antibody. Immune-profiling showed that CT-26 tumor tissue was infiltrated with more immune cells than Colon 26. Genomic/transcriptomic analyses highlighted thatWnt pathway was one of the potential differences between CT-26 and Colon 26, showing Wnt activity was higher in Colon 26 than CT-26. . CONCLUSIONS: CT-26 and Colon 26 syngeneic tumor models showed different sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy, although both tumor cells are murine colorectal carcinoma cell lines from BALB/c strain. By characterizing the mouse cells lines and tumor-immune context in the tumor tissues with comprehensive analysis approaches, we found that CT-26 showed \"hot tumor\" profile with more infiltrated immune cells than Colon 26. Further pathway analyses enable us to propose a hypothesis that Wnt pathway could be one of the major factors to differentiate CT-26 from Colon 26 model and link to anti-PD-1 response. Our approach to focus on preclinical tumor models with similar genetic background but different sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy would contribute to illustrating the potential mechanism of anti-PD-1 response and to generating a novel concept to synergize current anti-PD-1 therapies for cancer patients."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) may contribute to the lack of durable responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB); however, mouse models to test this are currently lacking. Proper selection and use of preclinical models are necessary for rigorous, preclinical studies to rapidly move laboratory findings into the clinic. METHODS: Three versions of a common syngeneic model derived from the MMTV-PyMT autochthonous model were generated by inoculating 1E6, 1E5, or 1E4 cells derived from the MMTV-PyMT mouse into wildtype recipient mice. To elucidate how tumor latency and TME heterogeneity contribute to ICB resistance, comprehensive characterization of the TME using quantitative flow-cytometry and RNA expression analysis (NanoString) was performed. Subsequently, response to ICB was tested. These procedures were repeated using the EMT6 breast cancer model. RESULTS: The 3 syngeneic versions of the MMTV-PyMT model had vastly different TMEs that correlated to ICB response. The number of cells used to generate syngeneic tumors significantly influenced tumor latency, infiltrating leukocyte populations, and response to ICB. These results were confirmed using the EMT6 breast cancer model. Compared to the MMTV-PyMT autochthonous model, all 3 MMTV-PyMT syngeneic models had significantly more tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs; CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) and higher proportions of PD-L1-positive myeloid cells, whereas the MMTV-PyMT autochthonous model had the highest frequency of myeloid cells out of total leukocytes. Increased TILs correlated with response to anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy, but PD-L1expression on tumor cells or PD-1 expression of T cells did not. CONCLUSIONS: These studies reveal that tumor cell number correlates with tumor latency, TME, and response to ICB. ICB-sensitive and resistant syngeneic breast cancer models were identified, in which the 1E4 syngeneic model was most resistant to ICB. Given the lack of benefit from ICB in breast cancer, identifying robust murine models presented here provides the opportunity to further interrogate the TME for breast cancer treatment and provide novel insights into therapeutic combinations to overcome ICB resistance."

An important class of preclinical in vivo models for immuno-oncology is immunocompetent mice bearing mouse syngeneic tumors. To facilitate translation of preclinical studies into human, we characterized the genomic, transcriptomic, and protein expression of a panel of ten commonly used mouse tumor cell lines grown in vitro culture as well as in vivo tumors. RESULTS: Our studies identified a number of genetic and cellular phenotypic differences that distinguish commonly used mouse syngeneic models in our study from human cancers. Only a fraction of the somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in these common mouse cell lines directly match SNVs in human actionable cancer genes. Some models derived from epithelial tumors have a more mesenchymal phenotype with relatively low T-lymphocyte infiltration compared to the corresponding human cancers. CT26, a colon tumor model, had the highest immunogenicity and was the model most responsive to CTLA4 inhibitor treatment, by contrast to the relatively low immunogenicity and response rate to checkpoint inhibitor therapies in human colon cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The relative immunogenicity of these ten syngeneic tumors does not resemble typical human tumors derived from the same tissue of origin. By characterizing the mouse syngeneic models and comparing with their human tumor counterparts, this study contributes to a framework that may help investigators select the model most relevant to study a particular immune-oncology mechanism, and may rationalize some of the challenges associated with translating preclinical findings to clinical studies."

However, response rates to current immune checkpoint inhibitors vary widely between patients and different types of cancer, and the mechanisms underlying these varied responses are poorly understood. Insights into the antitumor activities of checkpoint inhibitors are often obtained using syngeneic mouse models, which provide an in vivo preclinical basis for predicting efficacy in human clinical trials. Efforts to establish in vitro syngeneic mouse equivalents, which could increase throughput and permit real-time evaluation of lymphocyte infiltration and tumor killing, have been hampered by difficulties in recapitulating the tumor microenvironment in laboratory systems. Here, we describe a multiplex in vitro system that overcomes many of the deficiencies seen in current static histocultures, which we applied to the evaluation of checkpoint blockade in tumors derived from syngeneic mouse models. Our system enables both precision-controlled perfusion across biopsied tumor fragments and the introduction of checkpoint-inhibited tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in a single experiment. Through real-time high-resolution confocal imaging and analytics, we demonstrated excellent correlations between in vivo syngeneic mouse and in vitro tumor biopsy responses to checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting the use of this platform for higher throughput evaluation of checkpoint efficacy as a tool for drug development."

Then, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the number, proportion, and activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Cytokine and chemokine production was detected both in vivo and in vitro by PCR array analysis and cytokine antibody arrays. The treatment efficacy of combined abemaciclib and anti-PD-1 therapy was evaluated in vivo, and CD8+ and CD4+ T cell activities were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lastly, the requirement for both CD8+ T cells and B cells in combination treatment was evaluated in vivo, and potential cellular mechanisms were further analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: We observed that abemaciclib monotherapy could enhance immune infiltration, especially CD8+ T cell and B cell infiltration, in the ID8 murine ovarian cancer model. Immunophenotyping analysis showed that abemaciclib induced a proinflammatory immune response in the tumor microenvironment. PCR array analysis suggested the presence of a Th1-polarized cytokine profile in abemaciclib-treated ID8 tumors. In vitro studies showed that abemaciclib-treated ID8 cells secreted more CXCL10 and CXCL13, thus recruiting more lymphocytes than control groups. Combination treatment achieved better tumor control than monotherapy, and the activities of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were further enhanced when compared with monotherapy. The synergistic antitumor effects of combined abemaciclib and anti-PD-1 therapy depended on both CD8+ T cells and B cells. Conclusion: These findings suggest that combined treatment with CDK4/6i and anti-PD-1 antibody could improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and hold great promise for the treatment of poorly immune-infiltrated ovarian cancer."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows limited efficacy in ovarian cancers due to the \"cold\" immune phenotype surrounding these tumors. Previous studies have shown that in ovarian cancer Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation contributes to this immune phenotype. Here, we evaluated the anti-tumor and immune-enhancing properties of the Wnt inhibitor, CGX-1321, used alone or in combination with either DKN-01 or anti-PD-1 therapy, in pre-clinical ovarian cancer models. METHODS: The parental ID8 murine ovarian cancer model harboring a knock-out of p53 (ID8p53-/-) and MISIIR-Tag spontaneous ovarian cancer models were used to test the effects of CGX-1321 alone or in combination therapies on tumor burden and immune cell landscape in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Flow cytometry and NanoString analyses were used to characterize the changes in tumor-intrinsic signaling and immune-related profiles in the TME of ovarian cancer in response to treatments. RESULTS: CGX-1321 significantly reduced tumor burden and constrained tumor progression in the ID8p53-/- and MISIIR-Tag models. Furthermore, CGX-1321 increased infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the TME. Combining CGX-1321 with either DKN-01 or anti-PD-1 therapy also decreased tumor burden and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in the omentum TME but did not do so to a greater extent that CGX-1321 monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: CGX-1321 significantly reduced tumor burden and enhanced CD8+ T cell levels in ovarian cancer, nevertheless the addition of DKN-01 or anti-PD-1 therapies did not enhance these effects of CGX-1321. Further investigation is needed to determine if CGX-1321\u00a0+\u00a0DKN-01 combination treatment sensitizes pre-clinical ovarian cancer to ICB therapy."

                "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, while groundbreaking, must be improved to promote enhanced durable responses and to prevent the development of treatment-refractory disease. Cancer therapies that engage, enable, and expand the antitumor immune response will likely require rationally designed combination strategies. Targeting multiple immunosuppressive pathways simultaneously may provide additional therapeutic benefit over singular targeting. We therefore hypothesized that the use of two molecules which inhibit three independent, but overlapping, pathways (TIGIT:CD155, PD-1/PD-L1, and TGF\u03b2) would provide significant antitumor efficacy in the syngeneic ICB resistant colorectal tumor model MC38 expressing human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in CEA transgenic mice. This novel combination treatment strategy has significant antitumor activity and survival benefit in two models of murine carcinomas, MC38-CEA (CRC) and TC1 (HPV+ lung carcinoma). MC38-CEA mice that responded to \u03b1TIGIT and bintrafusp alfa combination therapy generated memory responses and were protected from rechallenge. These effects were dependent on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as increased immune infiltration into the TME. This combination induced production of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, and an increase in activation and cytotoxicity resulting in an overall activated immune landscape in the tumor. Data presented herein demonstrate the \u03b1TIGIT and bintrafusp alfa combination has efficacy across multiple tumor models, including the checkpoint-resistant model of murine colon carcinoma, MC38-CEA and the HPV+ model TC-1."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors has drastically improved the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but innate and acquired resistances are hurdles needed to be solved. Immunomodulatory drugs that can reinvigorate the immune cytotoxic activity, in combination with antiprogrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody, are a great promise to overcome resistance. We evaluated the impact of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) on NSCLC prognosis, and the immunomodulatory effect of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib, in combination with anti-PD-1, in clinically relevant mouse models of NSCLC. METHODS: A cohort of patients from University Clinic of Navarra (n=116) was used to study immune infiltrates by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and YES1 protein expression in tumor samples. Publicly available resources (TCGA, Km Plotter, and CIBERSORT) were used to study patient's survival based on expression of SFKs and tumor infiltrates. Syngeneic NSCLC mouse models 393P and UNSCC680AJ were used for in vivo drug testing. RESULTS: Among the SFK members, YES1 expression showed the highest association with poor prognosis. Patients with high YES1 tumor levels also showed high infiltration of CD4+/FOXP3+ cells (regulatory T cells (Tregs)), suggesting an immunosuppressive phenotype. After testing for YES1 expression in a panel of murine cell lines, 393P and UNSCC680AJ were selected for in vivo studies. In the 393P model, dasatinib+anti-PD-1 treatment resulted in synergistic activity, with 87% tumor regressions and development of immunological memory that impeded tumor growth when mice were rechallenged. In vivo depletion experiments further showed that CD8+ and\u2009CD4+ cells are necessary for the therapeutic effect of the combination. The antitumor activity was accompanied by a very significant decrease in the number of Tregs, which was validated by mIF in tumor sections. In the UNSCC680AJ model, the antitumor effects of dasatinib+anti-PD-1 were milder but similar to the 393P model. In in vitro assays, we demonstrated that dasatinib blocks proliferation and transforming growth factor beta-driven conversion of effector CD4+ cells into Tregs through targeting of phospholymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase and downstream effectors pSTAT5 and pSMAD3. CONCLUSIONS: YES1 protein expression is associated with increased numbers of Tregs in patients with NSCLC. Dasatinib synergizes with anti-PD-1 to impair tumor growth in NSCLC experimental models. This study provides the preclinical rationale for the combined use of dasatinib and PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 blockade to improve outcomes of patients with NSCLC."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is effective against many cancer types. However, due in part to unresponsiveness or acquired resistance, not all patients experience a durable response to ICIs. HBI-8000 is a novel, orally bioavailable class I selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that directly modifies antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and resensitization to apoptotic stimuli in adult T cell lymphoma patients. We hypothesized that HBI-8000 functions as an epigenetic immunomodulator to reprogram the tumor microenvironment from immunologically cold (nonresponsive) to hot (responsive). METHOD: Mice bearing syngeneic tumors (MC38 and CT26 murine colon carcinoma and A20 B-cell lymphoma were treated daily with HBI-8000 (orally), alone or in combination with PD-1, PD-1\u2009L, or CTLA-4 antibodies. MC38 tumors were also analyzed in nanoString gene expression analysis. RESULTS: HBI-8000 augmented the activity of ICI antibodies targeting either PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4, and significantly increased tumor regression (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the above models. Gene expression analysis of the treated MC38 tumors revealed significant changes in mRNA expression of immune checkpoints, with enhanced dendritic cell and antigen-presenting cell functions, and modulation of MHC class I and II molecules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HBI-8000 mediates epigenetic modifications in the tumor microenvironment, leading to improved efficacy of ICIs, and provide strong rationale for combination therapies with ICIs and HBI-8000 in the clinical setting. PRECIS: As an HDACi, HBI-8000 plays an important role in priming the immune system in the tumor microenvironment. The current preclinical data further justifies testing combination of HBI-8000 and ICIs in the clinic."

                "abstract": "Murine syngeneic tumor models are critical to novel immuno-based therapy development, but the molecular and immunologic features of these models are still not clearly defined. The translational relevance of differences between the models is not fully understood, impeding appropriate preclinical model selection for target validation, and ultimately hindering drug development. Across a panel of commonly used murine syngeneic tumor models, we showed variable responsiveness to immunotherapies. We used array comparative genomic hybridization, whole-exome sequencing, exon microarray analysis, and flow cytometry to extensively characterize these models, which revealed striking differences that may underlie these contrasting response profiles. We identified strong differential gene expression in immune-related pathways and changes in immune cell-specific genes that suggested differences in tumor immune infiltrates between models. Further investigation using flow cytometry showed differences in both the composition and magnitude of the tumor immune infiltrates, identifying models that harbor \"inflamed\" and \"non-inflamed\" tumor immune infiltrate phenotypes. We also found that immunosuppressive cell types predominated in syngeneic mouse tumor models that did not respond to immune-checkpoint blockade, whereas cytotoxic effector immune cells were enriched in responsive models. A cytotoxic cell-rich tumor immune infiltrate has been correlated with increased efficacy of immunotherapies in the clinic, and these differences could underlie the varying response profiles to immunotherapy between the syngeneic models.

Despite their widespread use, a comprehensive view of their tumor-immune compositions and their relevance to human tumors has only begun to emerge. We propose each model possesses a unique tumor-immune infiltrate profile that can be probed with immunotherapies to inform on anti-tumor mechanisms and treatment strategies in human tumors with similar profiles. In support of this endeavor, we characterized the tumor microenvironment of four commonly used models and demonstrate they encompass a range of immunogenicities, from highly immune infiltrated RENCA tumors to poorly infiltrated B16F10 tumors. Tumor cell lines for each model exhibit different intrinsic factors in vitro that likely influence immune infiltration upon subcutaneous implantation. Similarly, solid tumors in vivo for each model are unique, each enriched in distinct features ranging from pathogen response elements to antigen presentation machinery. As RENCA tumors progress in size, all major T cell populations diminish while myeloid-derived suppressor cells become more enriched, possibly driving immune suppression and tumor progression. In CT26 tumors, CD8 T cells paradoxically increase in density yet are restrained as tumor volume increases. Finally, immunotherapy treatment across these different tumor-immune landscapes segregate into responders and non-responders based on features partially dependent on pre-existing immune infiltrates. Overall, these studies provide an important resource to enhance our translation of syngeneic models to human tumors. Future mechanistic studies paired with this resource will help identify responsive patient populations and improve strategies where immunotherapies are predicted to be ineffective."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Appropriate preclinical mouse models are needed to evaluate the response to immunotherapeutic agents. Immunocompetent mouse models have rarely been reported for gastric cancer. Thus, we investigated immunophenotypes and responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in immunocompetent mouse models using various murine gastric cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed subcutaneous syngeneic tumors with murine gastric cancer cell lines, YTN3 and YTN16, in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were intraperitoneally treated with IgG isotype control or an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) neutralizing antibody. We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the tumor-infiltrating immune cells of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse tumor tissues. We compared the protein and RNA expression between YTN3 and YTN16 cell lines using a mouse cytokine array and RNA sequencing. RESULTS: The mouse tumors revealed distinct histological and molecular characteristics. YTN16 cells showed upregulation of genes and proteins related to immunosuppression, such as Ccl2 (CCL2) and Csf1 (M-CSF). Macrophages and exhausted T cells were more enriched in YTN16 tumors than in YTN3 tumors. Several YTN3 tumors were completely regressed by the PD-L1 inhibitor, whereas YTN16 tumors were unaffected. Although treatment with a PD-L1 inhibitor increased infiltration of T cells in both the tumors, the proportion of exhausted immune cells did not decrease in the non-responder group. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the histological and molecular features of cancer cells with various responses to ICI. Our models can be used in preclinical research on ICI resistance mechanisms to enhance clinical efficacy."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The success of agents that reverse T-cell inhibitory signals, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, has reinvigorated cancer immunotherapy research. However, since only a minority of patients respond to single-agent therapies, methods to test the potential anti-tumor activity of rational combination therapies are still needed. Conventional murine xenograft models have been hampered by their immune-compromised status; thus, we developed a hematopoietic humanized mouse model, hu-CB-BRGS, and used it to study anti-tumor human immune responses to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line and patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) xenografts (PDX). METHODS: BALB/c-Rag2nullIl2r\u03b3nullSIRP\u03b1NOD (BRGS) pups were humanized through transplantation of cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ cells. Mice were evaluated for human chimerism in the blood and assigned into experimental untreated or nivolumab groups based on chimerism. TNBC cell lines or tumor tissue from established CRC PDX models were implanted into both flanks of humanized mice and treatments ensued once tumors reached a volume of ~150mm3. Tumors were measured twice weekly. At end of study, immune organs and tumors were collected for immunological assessment. RESULTS: Humanized PDX models were successfully established with a high frequency of tumor engraftment. Humanized mice treated with anti-PD-1 exhibited increased anti-tumor human T-cell responses coupled with decreased Treg and myeloid populations that correlated with tumor growth inhibition. Combination therapies with anti-PD-1 treatment in TNBC-bearing mice reduced tumor growth in multi-drug cohorts. Finally, as observed in human colorectal patients, anti-PD-1 therapy had a strong response to a microsatellite-high CRC PDX that correlated with a higher number of human CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ T cells in the tumor. CONCLUSION: Hu-CB-BRGS mice represent an in vivo model to study immune checkpoint blockade to human tumors. The human immune system in the mice is inherently suppressed, similar to a tumor microenvironment, and thus allows growth of human tumors. However, the suppression can be released by anti-PD-1 therapies and inhibit tumor growth of some tumors. The model offers ample access to lymph and tumor cells for in-depth immunological analysis. The tumor growth inhibition correlates with increased CD8 IFN\u03b3+ tumor infiltrating T cells. These hu-CB-BRGS mice provide a relevant preclinical animal model to facilitate prioritization of hypothesis-driven combination immunotherapies."

However, numerous patients respond poorly to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Unresponsiveness to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) can cast significant challenges to the therapeutic options for patients with hard-to-treat tumors. There is an unmet clinical need to establish new therapeutic approaches for mitigating ICB unresponsiveness in patients. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and role of low-dose antineoplastic agent SN-38 or metformin in sensitizing unresponsive tumors to respond to ICB therapy. METHODS: We assessed the significant pathological relationships between PD-L1 and FOXO3 expression and between PD-L1 and c-Myc or STAT3 expression in patients with various tumors. We determined the efficacy of low-dose SN-38 or metformin in sensitizing unresponsive tumors to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy in a syngeneic tumor system. We deciphered novel therapeutic mechanisms underlying the SN-38 and anti-PD-1 therapy-mediated engagement of natural killer (NK) or CD8+ T cells to infiltrate tumors and boost antitumor immunity. RESULTS: We showed that PD-L1 protein level was inversely associated with FOXO3 protein level in patients with ovarian, breast, and hepatocellular tumors. Low-dose SN-38 or metformin abrogated PD-L1 protein expression, promoted FOXO3 protein level, and significantly increased the animal survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor models. SN-38 or metformin sensitized unresponsive tumors responding to anti-PD-1 therapy by engaging NK or CD8+ T cells to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and secret interferon-\u03b3 and granzyme B to kill tumors. SN-38 suppressed the levels of c-Myc and STAT3 proteins, which controlled PD-L1 expression. FOXO3 was essential for SN38-mediated PD-L1 suppression. The expression of PD-L1 was compellingly linked to that of c-Myc or STAT3 in patients with the indicated tumors. CONCLUSION: We show that SN-38 or metformin can boost antitumor immunity in the TME by inhibiting c-Myc and STAT3 through FOXO3 activation. These results may provide novel insight into ameliorating patient response to overarching immunotherapy for tumors."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding the mechanisms of non-T cell inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) and their modulation are important to improve cancer immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. The involvement of various immunometabolisms has recently been indicated in the formation of immunosuppressive TME. In this study, we investigated the immunological roles of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which is essential for fatty acid metabolism, in the cancer immune response. METHODS: We investigated the roles of SCD1 by inhibition with the chemical inhibitor or genetic manipulation in antitumor T cell responses and the therapeutic effect of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody using various mouse tumor models, and their cellular and molecular mechanisms. The roles of SCD1 in human cancers were also investigated by gene expression analyses of colon cancer tissues and by evaluating the related free fatty acids in sera obtained from patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1 antibody. RESULTS: Systemic administration of a SCD1 inhibitor in mouse tumor models enhanced production of CCL4 by cancer cells through reduction of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and by CD8+ effector T cells through reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. It in turn promoted recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) into the tumors and enhanced the subsequent induction and tumor accumulation of antitumor CD8+ T cells. SCD1 inhibitor was also found to directly stimulate DCs and CD8+ T cells. Administration of SCD1 inhibitor or SCD1 knockout in mice synergized with an anti-PD-1 antibody for its antitumor effects in mouse tumor models. High SCD1 expression was observed in one of the non-T cell-inflamed subtypes in human colon cancer, and serum SCD1 related fatty acids were correlated with response rates and prognosis of patients with non-small lung cancer following anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SCD1 expressed in cancer cells and immune cells causes immunoresistant conditions, and its inhibition augments antitumor T cells and therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 antibody. Therefore, SCD1 is an attractive target for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve current cancer immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Variable PD-L1 expression in PDAC indicates a potential access issue of PD-L1-targeted therapy. To monitor target engagement of PD-L1-targeted therapy, we generated a PD-L1-targeted PET tracer labeled with zirconium-89 (89Zr). As the MAPK signaling pathway (MEK and ERK) is known to modulate PD-L1 expression in other tumor types, we used [89Zr]Zr-DFO-anti-PD-L1 as a tool to noninvasively assess whether manipulation of the MAPK signaling cascade could be leveraged to modulate PD-L1 expression and thereby immunotherapeutic outcomes in PDAC. In this study, we observed that the inhibition of MEK or ERK is sufficient to increase PD-L1 expression, which we hypothesized could be leveraged for anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy. We found that the combination of ERK inhibition and anti-PD-L1 therapy corresponded with a significant improvement of overall survival in a syngeneic mouse model of PDAC. Furthermore, IHC analysis indicates that the survival benefit may be CD8+ T-cell mediated. The therapeutic and molecular imaging tool kit developed could be exploited to better structure clinical trials and address the therapeutic gaps in challenging malignancies such as PDAC."

However, most patients do not respond to ICB, and reliable biomarkers of ICB response are needed to improve patient stratification. Here, we performed a transcriptome-wide meta-analysis across 1,486 tumors from ICB-treated patients and tumors with expected ICB outcomes based on microsatellite status. Using a robust transcriptome deconvolution approach, we inferred cancer- and stroma-specific gene expression differences and identified cell-type specific features of ICB response across cancer types. Consistent with current knowledge, stromal expression of CXCL9, CXCL13, and IFNG were the top determinants of favorable ICB response. In addition, we identified a group of potential immune-suppressive genes, including FCER1A, associated with poor response to ICB. Strikingly, PD-L1 expression in stromal cells, but not cancer cells, is correlated with ICB response across cancer types. Furthermore, the unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis failed to identify cancer-cell intrinsic expression signatures of ICB response conserved across tumor types, suggesting that cancer cells lack tissue-agnostic transcriptomic features of ICB response. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results challenge the prevailing dogma that cancer cells present tissue-agnostic molecular markers that modulate immune activity and ICB response, which has implications on the development of improved ICB diagnostics and treatments."

Lack of sensitivity to PD-1 blockade was not attributed to dysregulation of PD-L1 or \u03b22M expression, as both were expressed at similar levels in parental and resistant cells. Similarly, IFN\u03b3 signaling and antigen processing and presentation pathways were functional in both parental and resistant cell lines. Unbiased gene expression analysis was used to further characterize potential resistance mechanisms. RNA-sequencing revealed substantial differences in global gene expression, with tumors resistant to anti-PD-1 displaying a marked reduction in expression of immune-related genes relative to parental MC38 tumors. Indeed, resistant tumors exhibited reduced immune infiltration across multiple cell types, including T and NK cells. Pathway analysis revealed activation of TGF\u03b2 and Notch signaling in anti-PD-1 resistant tumors, and activation of these pathways was associated with poorer survival in human cancer patients. While pharmacological inhibition of TGF\u03b2 and Notch in combination with PD-1 blockade decelerated tumor growth, a local mRNA-based immunotherapy potently induced regression of resistant tumors, resulting in complete tumor remission, and resensitized tumors to treatment with anti-PD-1. Overall, this study describes a novel anti-PD-1 resistant mouse tumor model and underscores the role of two well-defined signaling pathways in response to immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, our data highlights the potential of intratumoral mRNA therapy in overcoming acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite its enormous successes, the overall response rate of cancer immunotherapy remains suboptimal, especially in breast cancer. There is an increased interest in combining immune checkpoint inhibitor with targeted agents to enhance antitumor effect. Anti-angiogenic drugs have been shown to synergize with immune checkpoint blockades, but the optimal setting for combining these two modalities and the underlying mechanisms of synergistic responses are not fully understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested the combination of anti-PD-1 and different doses of VEGFR2-targeting agents in syngeneic breast cancer mouse models. Tumor-infiltrated immune cell subsets were profiled by flow cytometry. A cytokine array was carried out to identify inflammatory changes in different treatment conditions. The efficacy of combined anti-angiogenic and anti-PD-1 therapy was further evaluated in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). RESULTS: Blockade of VEGFR2 sensitizes breast tumors to PD-1 blockade in a dose-dependent manner. Although both conventional and low-dose anti-VEGFR2 antibody treatments normalize tumor vessels, low-dose VEGFR2 blockade results in more robust immune cell infiltration and activation and promotes the secretion of osteopontin (OPN) by CD8+ T cells. OPN subsequently induces tumor cell production of TGF-\u03b2, which in turn upregulates PD-1 expression on immune cells. In patients with advanced TNBC, combined treatment with low-dose anti-VEGFR2 inhibitor and anti-PD-1 demonstrated excellent tolerability and efficacy. Higher OPN and TGF-\u03b2 expressions correlated with improved treatment responses. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results demonstrate a dose-dependent synergism between anti-angiogenic therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, thus providing important insights into the optimal strategies for combining immunotherapy with molecular-targeted agents."

                "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been recognized as one cause of tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, but the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. In the present study, a bone marrow-derived CAF (BMF) -rich tumor model is successfully established by subcutaneously mixed inoculation of BMFs and tumor cells into mice and the BMF-mixed tumor xenografts are demonstrated to be resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibody immunotherapy compared to the mere tumor xenografts. In vitro assays via the co-culture system of BMFs and tumor cells indicate that the co-cultured BMFs are induced to overexpress PD-L1, while there is no such a phenomenon in the co-cultured cancer cells. The further knock-out of PD-L1 in BMFs rescues the sensitivity of BMF-mixed tumor xenografts to PD-L1 blockade therapy. Mechanistically, via the microarray assay, we identify that the upregulation of PD-L1 in BMFs stimulated by cancer cells is medicated by the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in BMFs. Moreover, the administration of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitors, including XAV-939 and Wnt-C59, distinctly inhibits the upregulation of PD-L1 expression in the co-cultured BMFs. The further combination administration of XAV-939 significantly potentiates the therapeutic outcome of PD-L1 blockade therapy in BMF-mixed tumors. In summary, our study demonstrates that Wnt inhibition augments PD-L1 blockade efficacy by overcoming BMF-mediated immunotherapy resistance."

However, little is known about their cell-type-specific roles in the absence of suitable tools that would allow for functional discrimination between the ontogenetically closely related microglia and CAMs. To develop a new microglia gene targeting model, we first applied massively parallel single-cell analyses to compare microglia and CAM signatures during homeostasis and disease and identified hexosaminidase subunit beta (Hexb) as a stably expressed microglia core gene, whereas other microglia core genes were substantially downregulated during pathologies. Next, we generated HexbtdTomato mice to stably monitor microglia behavior in vivo. Finally, the Hexb locus was employed for tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated gene manipulation in microglia and for fate mapping of microglia but not CAMs. In sum, we provide valuable new genetic tools to specifically study microglia functions in the CNS."

In the steady state, microglia are present in the CNS parenchyma, whereas macrophages reside in boundary regions of the CNS, such as perivascular spaces, the meninges and choroid plexus. In addition, monocytes infiltrate into the CNS parenchyma from circulation upon blood-brain barrier breakdown after CNS injury and inflammation. Although several markers, such as CD11b and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), are frequently used as microglial markers, they are also expressed by other types of myeloid cell and microglia-specific markers were not defined until recently. Previous transcriptome analyses of isolated microglia identified a transmembrane lectin, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin H (Siglec-H), as a molecular signature for microglia; however, this was not confirmed by histological studies in the nervous system and the reliability of Siglec-H as a microglial marker remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Siglec-H is an authentic marker for microglia in mice by immunohistochemistry using a Siglec-H-specific antibody. Siglec-H was expressed by parenchymal microglia from developmental stages to adulthood, and the expression was maintained in activated microglia under injury or inflammatory condition. However, Siglec-H expression was absent from CNS-associated macrophages and CNS-infiltrating monocytes, except for a minor subset of cells. We also show that the Siglech gene locus is a feasible site for specific targeting of microglia in the nervous system. In conclusion, Siglec-H is a reliable marker for microglia that will allow histological identification of microglia and microglia-specific gene manipulation in the nervous system."

Understanding the mechanisms of microglia-specific responses during pathologies is hence vital for reducing disease burden. The definition of microglial functions has so far been hampered by the lack of genetic in vivo approaches that allow discrimination of microglia from closely related peripheral macrophage populations in the body. Here we introduce a mouse experimental system that specifically targets microglia to examine the role of a mitogen-associated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), during autoimmune inflammation. Conditional depletion of TAK1 in microglia only, not in neuroectodermal cells, suppressed disease, significantly reduced CNS inflammation and diminished axonal and myelin damage by cell-autonomous inhibition of the NF-\u03baB, JNK and ERK1/2 pathways. Thus, we found TAK1 to be pivotal in CNS autoimmunity, and we present a tool for future investigations of microglial function in the CNS. "

                "abstract": "Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The exact role of microglia in CNS disorders is not clear due to lack of tools to discriminate between microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells. Here, we present a novel reporter mouse model targeting a microglia-specific marker, TMEM119, for studying microglia in health and disease. By placing a reporter cassette (GSG-3xFlag-P2A-tdTomato) between the coding sequence of exon 2 and 3'UTR of the Tmem119 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a Tmem119-tdTomato knock-in mouse strain. Gene expression assay showed no difference of endogenous Tmem119 in the CNS of Tmem119tdTomato/+ relative to wild-type mice. The cells expressing tdTomato were recognized by immunofluorescence staining using commercially available anti-TMEM119 antibodies. Additionally, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry techniques revealed that tdTomato+ cells are detected throughout the CNS, but not in peripheral tissues of Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Aging does not influence TMEM119 expression as tdTomato+ cells were detectable in the CNS of older mice (300 and 540\u202fdays old). Further immunofluorescence characterization shows that tdTomato+ cells colocalize with Iba1+ cells in the brain, but not with neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of brain tissues of adult mice demonstrates that the majority of microglia CD45loCD11b+ cells (96.3%) are tdTomato-positive; and a minority of infiltrating CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid cells (5.3%) are also tdTomato-positive, which we further characterized and found that tdTomato expression is in part of choroid plexus macrophages but not in meningeal and perivascular macrophages. Functionally, using an acute injury model, we measured time-lapse activation of tdTomato-labeled microglia by transcranial two-photon microscopy in live Tmem119tdTomato/+ mice. Taken together, the Tmem119-tdTomato reporter mouse model is a valuable tool to specifically study the role of microglia in health and disease."

Here, we will review recent progress in this field that suggest distinct roles of microglia and MoMF in disease induction and progression, capitalizing on novel transgenic mouse models. The latter finding could have major implications for the rationale development of therapeutic approaches to the management of brain inflammation and MS therapy. "

Together, they perform a variety of different functions: they are the primary sensors of brain pathology, they are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, trauma or autoimmune inflammation in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and they are competent presenters of antigen and interact with T cells recruited to the inflamed CNS. They also synthesise a variety of molecules, such as cytokines (TNF, interleukins), chemokines, accessory molecules (B7, CD40), complement, cell adhesion glycoproteins (integrins, selectins), reactive oxygen radicals and neurotrophins, that could exert a damaging or a protective effect on adjacent axons, myelin and oligodendrocytes. The current review will give a detailed summary on their cellular response, describe the different classes of molecules expressed and their attribution to the blood derived or brain-resident macrophages and then discuss how these molecules contribute to the neuropathology. Recent advances using chimaeric and genetically modified mice have been particularly telling about the specific, overlapping and nonoverlapping roles of macrophages and microglia in the demyelinating disease. Interestingly, they point to a crucial role of hematogenous macrophages in initiating inflammation and myelin removal, and that of microglia in checking excessive response and in the induction and maintenance of remission."

It has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders as well as primary and metastatic brain tumors. Microglia, the brain-resident immune cells, are emerging as a central player in regulating key pathways in CNS inflammation. Recent insights into neuroinflammation indicate that blood-borne immune cells represent an additional critical cellular component in mediating CNS inflammation. The lack of experimental systems that allow for discrimination between brain-resident and recruited myeloid cells has previously halted functional analysis of microglia and their blood-borne counterparts in brain malignancies. However, recent conceptual and technological advances, such as the generation of lineage tracing models and the identification of cell type-specific markers provide unprecedented opportunities to study the cellular functions of microglia and macrophages by functional interference. The use of different \"omic\" strategies as well as imaging techniques has significantly increased our knowledge of disease-associated gene signatures and effector functions under pathological conditions. In this review, recent developments in evaluating functions of brain-resident and recruited myeloid cells in neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancers will be discussed and unique or shared cellular traits of microglia and macrophages in different CNS disorders will be highlighted. Insight from these studies will shape our understanding of disease- and cell-type-specific effector functions of microglia or macrophages and will open new avenues for therapeutic intervention that target aberrant functions of myeloid cells in CNS pathologies."

However, LysM has been recently described to be expressed in brain neurons and there is a debate on whether it is also expressed by resident microglia in addition to infiltrating macrophages. Methods: We examined LysM-cre recombination in retinal tissue using a LysM-cre/tdTomato reporter mouse together with immunolabeling for several retinal cell markers. We further compared LysM-cre tdTomato recombination with that of Cdh5-cre driver, which is expressed in both endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Results: LysM-cre was strongly expressed in most microglia/resident macrophages in neonatal retinas (P8) and to a lesser extent in microglia of adult retinas. In addition, there was some neuronal recombination (8 %) of LysM-cre specifically in adult retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells. After retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, LysM-cre was strongly expressed in microglia/infiltrating macrophages. Cdh5-cre was expressed in endothelial and myeloid cells of P8 pups retinas. Unexpectedly, Cdh5 showed additional expression in adult mouse retinal ganglion cells and brain neurons. Conclusions: LysM-cre is expressed in macrophages and a subset of microglia together with a small but significant recombination of LysM-cre in the retinal neurons of adult mice. Cdh5 also showed some neuronal expression in both retina and brain of adult mice. These findings should be taken into consideration when interpreting results from central nervous system research using LysM-cre and Cdh5-cre mice."

                "abstract": "Microglia are cells of the myeloid lineage that reside in the central nervous system (CNS)(1). These cells play an important role in pathologies of many diseases associated with neuroinflammation such as multiple sclerosis (MS)(2). Microglia in a normal CNS express macrophage marker CD11b and exhibit a resting phenotype by expressing low levels of activation markers such as CD45. During pathological events in the CNS, microglia become activated as determined by upregulation of CD45 and other markers(3). The factors that affect microglia phenotype and functions in the CNS are not well studied. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a growing family of conserved molecules (~22 nucleotides long) that are involved in many normal physiological processes such as cell growth and differentiation(4) and pathologies such as inflammation(5). MiRNAs downregulate the expression of certain target genes by binding complementary sequences of their mRNAs and play an important role in the activation of innate immune cells including macrophages(6) and microglia(7). In order to investigate miRNA-mediated pathways that define the microglial phenotype, biological function, and to distinguish microglia from other types of macrophages, it is important to quantitatively assess the expression of particular microRNAs in distinct subsets of CNS-resident microglia. Common methods for measuring the expression of miRNAs in the CNS include quantitative PCR from whole neuronal tissue and in situ hybridization. However, quantitative PCR from whole tissue homogenate does not allow the assessment of the expression of miRNA in microglia, which represent only 5-15% of the cells of neuronal tissue. Hybridization in situ allows the assessment of the expression of microRNA in specific cell types in the tissue sections, but this method is not entirely quantitative. In this report we describe a quantitative and sensitive method for the detection of miRNA by real-time PCR in microglia isolated from normal CNS or during neuroinflammation using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for MS. The described method will be useful to measure the level of expression of microRNAs in microglia in normal CNS or during neuroinflammation associated with various pathologies including MS, stroke, traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors."

Dual reporter and serial deletion assays identified the critical role of the natural 5' untranslated region (-97 bp related to the first ATG) in driving transcriptional activity of the mouse Hexb gene. The native promoter region of mouse, human, and monkey HEXB are located at -135, -134, and -170 bp to the first ATG, respectively. These promoters were highly active and specific in microglia with strong cross-species transcriptional activities, but did not exhibit activity in primary astrocytes. In addition, we identified a 135 bp promoter of CD68 gene that was highly active in microglia but not in astrocytes. Considering that HEXB is specifically expressed in microglia, these data suggest that the newly characterized microglia-specific HEXB minimal/native promoter can be an ideal candidate for microglia-targeting AAV gene therapy in the CNS."

The absence of cell-type specific markers has confounded and complicated the analysis of cell-type specific contributions toward the onset, progression, and remission of neurodegeneration. Molecular screens comparing gene expression in cultured microglia and macrophages identified Golli-myelin basic protein (MBP) as a candidate molecule enriched in peripheral macrophages. In situ hybridization analysis of LPS/IFNg and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced CNS inflammation revealed that only a subset of CNS macrophages express Golli-MBP. Interestingly, the location and morphology of Golli-MBP+ CNS macrophages differs between these two models of CNS inflammation. These data demonstrate the difficulties of extending in vitro observations to in vivo biology and concretely illustrate the complex heterogeneity of macrophage activation states present in region- and stage-specific phases of CNS inflammation.

While T cells are known orchestrators of the immune response leading to MS pathology, the precise contribution of CNS resident and peripheral infiltrating myeloid cells is less well described. Here, we explore the myeloid cell function of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), a scavenger receptor involved in myelin clearance and the inflammatory response, in the context of Multiple sclerosis. Supporting its central role in Multiple sclerosis pathology, we find that LRP1 expression is increased in Multiple sclerosis lesions in comparison to the surrounding healthy tissue. Using two genetic mouse models, we show that deletion of LRP1 in microglia, but not in peripheral macrophages, negatively impacts the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of Multiple sclerosis. We further show\u00a0that the increased disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis\u00a0is not due to haplodeficiency of the\u00a0Cx3cr1\u00a0locus. At the cellular level, microglia lacking LRP1 adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by amoeboid morphology and increased production of the inflammatory mediator TNF-\u03b1. We also show that LRP1 functions as a robust inhibitor of NF-kB activation in myeloid cells via a MyD88 dependent pathway, potentially explaining the increase in disease severity observed in mice lacking LRP1 expression in microglia. Taken together, our data suggest that the function of LRP1 in microglia is to keep these cells in an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective status during inflammatory insult, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and potentially in Multiple sclerosis."

Before performing their effector functions in the target organ, T cells must recognize Ag presented by CNS APCs. Here, we investigate the nature and activity of the cells that present Ag within the CNS during myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE, with the goal of understanding their role in regulating inflammation. Both infiltrating macrophages (Mac-1(+)CD45(high)) and resident microglia (Mac-1(+)CD45(int)) expressed MHC-II, B7-1, and B7-2. Macrophages and microglia presented exogenous and endogenous CNS Ags to T cell lines and CNS T cells, resulting in IFN-gamma production. In contrast, Mac-1(-) cells were inefficient APCs during EAE. Late in disease, after mice had partially recovered from clinical signs of disease, there was a reduction in Ag-presenting capability that correlated with decreased MHC-II and B7-1 expression. Interestingly, although CNS APCs induced T cell cytokine production, they did not induce proliferation of either T cell lines or CNS T cells. This was attributable to production by CNS cells (mainly by macrophages) of NO. T cell proliferation was restored with an NO inhibitor, or if the APCs were obtained from inducible NO synthase-deficient mice. Thus, CNS APCs, though essential for the initiation of disease, also play a down-regulatory role. The mechanisms by which CNS APCs limit the expansion of autoreactive T cells in the target organ include their production of NO, which inhibits T cell proliferation, and their decline in Ag presentation late in disease."

                "abstract": "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) p70 and IL-23 are bioactive cytokines and their biological functions are becoming clear. Increased expression of IL-7 in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral immune cells is associated with multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Here, we describe the induction of IL-7 in primary mouse and human microglia, BV-2 microglial cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages and astrocytes by IL-12p70. Interestingly, IL-12 strongly induced the expression of IL-7 whereas IL-23 and other p40 family members remained weak inducers of IL-7 in these cell types. Consistently, IL-12, but not IL-23 and other p40 family members, induced IL-7 promoter-driven luciferase activity in microglial cells. Among various stimuli tested, IL-12 emerged as the most potent stimulus followed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and HIV-1 gp120 in inducing the activation of IL-7 promoter in microglial cells. Furthermore, increase in IL-7 mRNA expression by over-expression of IL-12p35 subunit, but not p40 and IL-23 p19 subunit, confirm that p35, but not p40 and p19, is responsible for the induction of IL-7. Finally, by using primary microglia from IL-12 receptor \u03b21-deficient (IL-12R\u03b21(-/-)) and IL-12R\u03b22(-/-) mice, we demonstrate that IL-12 induces the expression of IL-7 in microglia and macrophages via both IL-12R\u03b22 and IL-12R\u03b21. These studies delineate a novel biological function of IL-12 that is absent in IL-23 and other p40 family members."

                "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of incurable progressive disability in young adults caused by inflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). The capacity of microglia to clear tissue debris is essential for maintaining and restoring CNS homeostasis. This capacity diminishes with age, and age strongly associates with MS disease progression, although the underlying mechanisms are still largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the recovery from CNS inflammation in a murine model of MS is dependent on the ability of microglia to clear tissue debris. Microglia-specific deletion of the autophagy regulator Atg7, but not the canonical macroautophagy protein Ulk1, led to increased intracellular accumulation of phagocytosed myelin and progressive MS-like disease. This impairment correlated with a microglial phenotype previously associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. Moreover, Atg7-deficient microglia showed notable transcriptional and functional similarities to microglia from aged wild-type mice that were also unable to clear myelin and recover from disease. In contrast, induction of autophagy in aged mice using the disaccharide trehalose found in plants and fungi led to functional myelin clearance and disease remission. Our results demonstrate that a noncanonical form of autophagy in microglia is responsible for myelin degradation and clearance leading to recovery from MS-like disease and that boosting this process has a therapeutic potential for age-related neuroinflammatory conditions."

                "abstract": "A therapeutic goal in the treatment of certain CNS diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease, is to down-regulate inflammatory pathways. Inflammatory molecules produced by microglia are responsible for removal of damaged neurons, but can cause collateral damage to normal neurons located close to defective neurons. Although estrogen can inactivate microglia and inhibit the recruitment of T cells and macrophages into the CNS, there is controversy regarding which of the two estrogen receptors (ERs), ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2, mediates the beneficial effects in microglia. In this study, we found that ER\u03b2, but not ER\u03b1, is expressed in microglia. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in SJL/J mice, we evaluated the benefit of an ER\u03b2 agonist as a modulator of neuroinflammation. Treatment of EAE mice with LY3201, a selective ER\u03b2 agonist provided by Eli Lilly, resulted in marked reduction of activated microglia in the spinal cord. LY3201 down-regulated the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB, as well as the NF-\u03baB-induced gene inducible nitric oxide synthase in microglia and CD3(+) T cells. In addition, LY3201 inhibited T-cell reactivity through regulation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase. In the EAE model, treatment with LY3201 decreased mortality in the first 2 wk after disease onset, and also reduced the severity of symptoms in mice surviving for 4 wk. Our data show that ER\u03b2-selective agonists, by modulating the immune system in both microglia and T cells, offer promise as a useful class of drugs for treating degenerative diseases of the CNS."

To gain an understanding of the potential role of central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells in the presentation of endogenous myelin epitopes, we determined the individual antigen presentation and effector potential of resident microglia vs. infiltrating macrophages in the CNS of mice with ongoing TMEV-IDD by performing functional analysis of these populations separated to high purity by flow cytometric sorting based on their level of CD45 expression. Unlike microglia from nai;ve mice, peptide-pulsed CD45(lo) microglia isolated at the onset of clinical disease were as efficient as CNS-infiltrating CD45(hi) macrophages in activating proliferation and IFN-gamma production by myelin-peptide specific Th1 cells. In contrast, during the chronic stages of TMEV-IDD, CNS-infiltrating macrophages were more highly activated than the resident microglia as reflected both by higher expression of cell surface molecules associated with APC function and enhanced functional ability of spinal cord-infiltrating macrophages to stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro. Interestingly, both microglia and infiltrating macrophages expressed similar profiles of effector molecules such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 p40, TNF-alpha, and iNOS. Collectively, this is the first report comparing the antigen-presenting phenotype and function of microglia and infiltrating macrophages in a virus-induced model of CNS demyelination demonstrating that the resident microglia are capable APCs and may play an important role in antigen presentation at the onset of clinical disease and contribute to effector myelin destruction."

                "abstract": "Microglia subpopulations were studied in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and toxoplasmic encephalitis. CNS inflammation was associated with the proliferation of CD11b(+) brain cells that exhibited the dendritic cell (DC) marker CD11c. These cells constituted up to 30% of the total CD11b(+) brain cell population. In both diseases CD11c(+) brain cells displayed the surface phenotype of myeloid DC and resided at perivascular and intraparenchymatic inflammatory sites. By lacking prominent phagocytic organelles, CD11c(+) cells from inflamed brain proved distinct from other microglia, but strikingly resembled bone marrow-derived DC and thus were identified as DC. This brain DC population comprised cells strongly secreting IL-12p70, whereas coisolated CD11c(-) microglia/brain macrophages predominantly produced TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and NO. In comparison, the DC were more potent stimulators of naive or allogeneic T cell proliferation. Both DC and CD11c(-) microglia/macrophages from inflamed brain primed naive T cells from DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice for production of Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2. Resting microglia that had been purified from normal adult brain generated immature DC upon exposure to GM-CSF, while CD40 ligation triggered terminal maturation. Consistently, a functional maturation of brain DC was observed to occur following the onset of encephalitis. In conclusion, these findings indicate that in addition to inflammatory macrophage-like brain cells, intraparenchymatical DC exist in autoimmune and infectious encephalitis. These DC functionally mature upon disease onset and can differentiate from resident microglia. Their emergence, maturation, and prolonged activity within the brain might contribute to the chronicity of intracerebral Th1 responses."

                "abstract": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis in diabetic patients is characterized by enhanced inflammation and aggravated tissue damage in comparison with that in non-diabetic counterparts. The progression of periodontal damage under diabetic condition can be partly ascribed to hyperglycemia-induced disturbance between immune activation and inflammation resolution, where macrophages are capable of participating given their plasticity in response to different stimuli. Herein, we aimed to investigate the changes of macrophage polarization in periodontitis under diabetic condition and the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Type-1 diabetes was induced by the injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60\u00a0mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats in N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)-treated groups received NAC dissolved in drinking water (200\u00a0mg/kg/day). Experimental periodontitis was induced by ligating 3-0 silk around left maxillary second molars for 4\u00a0weeks. Alveolar bone destruction was tested by micro-computed tomography and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. M1/M2 macrophage polarization in periodontal tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. RAW264.7 were cultured in normal glucose (5.5\u00a0mM) or high glucose environment (25\u00a0mM) with or without NAC (8\u00a0mmol/L). LPS (100\u00a0ng/ml) and IL-4 (20\u00a0ng/ml) were used to induce M1\u00a0macrophages and M2 macrophages, respectively. M1/M2 macrophage polarization was detected by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining, and flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was detected by fluorogenic probes. RANKL (100\u00a0ng/ml) were applied to induce osteoclastogenic differentiation of RAW264.7, and osteoclast formation was examined by TRAP staining. RESULTS: Rats with diabetes displayed enhanced macrophages infiltration and M1 macrophage polarization in periodontal lesions compared with vehicle-treated rats. Under LPS or IL-4 stimulation, high glucose culture of RAW264.7 elevated ROS level and increased the expression of M1 macrophage markers (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) whereas decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers (Arg-1 and CD206). Supernatants of high glucose-treated M1/M2 macrophages enhanced osteoclast formation compared to normal glucose-cultured cells. Decreasing ROS level via NAC partially reversed the effect of high glucose on M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Meanwhile, daily intake of NAC in rodent models inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, which subsequently ameliorated alveolar bone loss and decreased osteoclast numbers in periodontitis in diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that hyperglycemia could polarize macrophage toward M1 macrophages via overproducing ROS under inflammatory condition, which might take responsibility for aggravated periodontal damage in periodontitis under diabetic condition. Inhibiting M1 macrophages and restoring M2 macrophages by ROS scavenger is hopefully a potential adjunct treatment strategy for diabetic periodontitis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our study was designed to explore the role of IL-37 in M1/M2 macrophage polarization imbalance in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease featured by gingival inflammation and alveolar bone resorption. Recent research has revealed that regulating macrophage polarization is a viable method to ameliorate periodontal inflammation. IL-37 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, which has been reported to inhibit innate and adaptive immunity. METHODS: For in\u00a0vitro experiment, mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 0.1\u2009ng/mL recombinant human IL-37. M1 and M2 polarizations of RAW264.7 cells were induced by 100\u2009ng/mL LPS and 20\u2009ng/mL IL-4, respectively. The expression of M1 (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) and M2 (CD206, Arg1, and IL-10) phenotype markers in RAW264.7 cells was detected by RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. For in\u00a0vivo experiment, experimental periodontitis mouse models were established by sterile silk ligation (5-0) around the bilateral maxillary second molar of mice for 1\u2009week. H&E staining of the maxillary alveolar bone was used to show the resorption of root cementum and dentin. Alveolar bone loss in mouse models was evaluated through micro-CT analysis. The expression of iNOS and CD206 in gingival tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was confirmed by western blotting. RESULTS: IL-37 pretreatment reduced iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 expression in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells but increased CD206, Arg1, and IL-10 in IL-4-treated RAW264.7 cells. LPS-induced upregulation in NLRP3, GSDMD, cleaved-IL-1\u03b2, and cleaved-caspase-1 expression was antagonized by IL-37 treatment. In addition, IL-37 administration ameliorated the resorption of root cementum and dentin in periodontitis mouse models. IL-37 prominently decreased iNOS+ cell population but increased CD206+ cell population in gingival tissues of periodontitis mice. The enhancement in NLRP3, GSDMD, cleaved-IL-1\u03b2, and cleaved-caspase-1 expression in the gingival tissues of periodontitis mice was offset by IL-37 administration. CONCLUSION: IL-37 prevents the progression of periodontitis by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mediating M1/M2 macrophage polarization."

The purpose of this research was to investigate the regulatory effect of carbon monoxide releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3) on LPS-induced macrophage polarization. LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells were exposed to CORM-3 for 24 h. Polarization of cells was checked by flow cytometry; expression of M1 or M2 macrophage-related factors and NF-\u03baB signaling factors was examined by RT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blot. Male C57 mice were divided into three groups: normal group; periodontitis group, where experimental periodontitis was established in mice; LPS+CORM-3 group, where mice with experimental periodontitis were treated with CORM-3. Polarization of macrophages and the expression of M1 or M2 macrophage-related factors were detected by immunofluorescence, ELISA, and RT-PCR. CORM-3 significantly reduced M1 macrophage proportion, but increased M2 proportion in LPS-stimulated cells. Accordingly, CORM-3 significantly suppressed the expression of M1 macrophage-related TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, but promoted M2-related IL-10 and Arg-1. The expression of p-p65, p-p50, and p-I\u03baB induced with LPS was inhibited by CORM-3. In vivo experiments indicated that CORM-3 induced more M2 macrophages in periodontal tissues in mice with experimental periodontitis. The expression of M1 macrophage-related factor in periodontitis was inhibited, but the expression of M2-related factors was increased by CORM-3. CORM-3 inhibits macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory M1-type and promotes to anti-inflammatory M2-type, which provides scientific basis for the application of CORM-3 in the treatment of periodontitis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a common oral disease with high prevalence worldwide. Neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 protein (Nell-1) has recently been reported to have anti-inflammation effects and may be a drug candidate for osteoarthritis. However, its immunotherapeutic effects in periodontitis remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Nell-1 on periodontitis in terms of macrophage polarization and analyze its possible underlying mechanism. METHODS: A rat ligation-induced experimental periodontitis model was established and locally injected with Nell-1 (n\u00a0=\u00a06/group). Periodontal tissue destruction and macrophage polarization in vivo were analyzed using micro-CT, histology analysis, and western blot. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate serum inflammatory cytokines. Then, the RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Nell-1, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125). RT-PCR, western blot, and flow cytometry were performed to further analyze the effect of Nell-1 on macrophage polarization and the underlying mechanism in vitro. RESULTS: Local treatment with Nell-1 significantly alleviated the destruction of alveolar bone and fibers in periodontitis, and upregulated the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages in periodontal tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In vitro, Nell-1 at the concentrations of 200 and 500\u00a0ng/mL could significantly inhibit the expression of M1-related inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and increase the expression of M2-related markers, regulating the macrophage phenotype switch into M2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The mRNA of JNK and relative protein level of phospho-JNK/JNK were also upregulated by Nell-1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) could reverse the effect of Nell-1 on macrophage polarization (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nell-1 could modulate the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages possibly through the JNK/MAPK signaling pathway, subsequently attenuating the inflammation and destruction of periodontal tissues caused by periodontitis."

The pathogenesis of periodontitis remains unclear. Host immunological responses to periodontal bacteria ultimately determine the severity and mechanisms governing periodontitis progression. This study aimed to clarify the effect of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) activator dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on a mouse periodontitis model and its underlying role in macrophage polarization. qRT-PCR analysis showed that DMOG inhibited the M1-like polarization of both RAW264.7 macrophages and murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and downregulated TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CD86, and MCP-1 expression in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry also confirmed the less percentage of F4/80\u00a0+\u00a0CD86\u00a0+\u00a0cells after DMOG treatment. The phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB pathway was also inhibited by DMOG with higher level of HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Furthermore, mice treated with DMOG showed decreased alveolar bone resorption in the experimental periodontitis model, with significant increases in alveolar bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD). DMOG treatment of mice decreased the ratio of M1/M2 (CD86+/CD206+) macrophages in periodontal tissues, resulting in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and increased levels of anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-4 and IL-10. DMOG treatment promoted the number of HIF-1\u03b1-positive cells in periodontal tissues. This study demonstrated the cell-specific roles of DMOG in macrophage polarization in vitro and provided insight into the mechanism underlying the protective effect of DMOG in a model of periodontitis."

                "abstract": "Periodontitis is characterized by the progressive destruction of tooth-supporting alveolar bone, which is mainly caused by chronic inflammation in response to persistent bacterial insult. It has recently become clear that the pathogenesis of periodontitis is associated with a high ratio of proinflammatory M1 (classically activated) macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 (alternatively activated). To decrease the inflammatory activity, we locally delivered the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) using controlled-release microparticles (MPs). CCL2 is known to promote chemotaxis of M0 or M2 phenotype macrophages to the inflamed site and induce M2 phenotype polarization locally. Our in vitro data showed that CCL2 increased the number of M2 phenotype macrophages, decreased TNF-\u03b1 secretion, and enhanced chemotaxis of RAW264.7 cells toward CCL2 MPs. Moreover, we induced periodontal disease in 2 animal models through inoculation of Porphyromonas gingivalis and ligature around the murine molar. Micro-computed tomography analysis showed significant reduction of alveolar bone loss in the CCL2 MP treatment group when compared with a blank MP group and a no-treatment periodontitis group in both models. Immunohistologic analysis showed a significant increase in the M2 phenotype subset and a decrease in the M1 phenotype subset in the CCL2 MP group of the P. gingivalis-induced model. Also, in both models, tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase staining showed significantly fewer numbers of osteoclasts in the CCL2 MP group in alveolar bone area. Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed a significant increase in IL-1RA (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) mRNA expression and a decrease in RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 ligand) mRNA expression in the CCL2 MP group in the ligature model. In summary, manipulation of endogenous M2 phenotype macrophages with CCL2 MPs decreased the M1 phenotype:M2 phenotype ratio and prevented alveolar bone loss in mouse periodontitis models. The delivery of CCL2 MPs provides a novel approach to treat periodontal disease."

It has been reported that B10 cells can regulate the immune response of macrophages during inflammation and are also able to regulate inflammation in periodontitis. However, whether B10 cells' regulation function in periodontitis is related to macrophage polarization remains unclear. This study aims to investigate whether B10 cells can regulate macrophage polarization in periodontitis. METHODS: Macrophages were cocultured with B10 cells in vitro for 5\u00a0days. After coculture, macrophages were obtained for analysis directly or followed by stimulation with Pg-LPS/IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4/IL-13. Flow cytometry and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were employed to detect the expression of IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, CD206, and ARG-1 in macrophages. B10 cells were transferred on the 5th day after ligation in wild or macrophage-depletion mice. Toluidine blue and TRAP staining were used to evaluate alveolar bone resorption and osteoclast activation. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of CD68, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, ARG-1, and IL-10. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of CD68+CD86+M1 macrophages and CD68+CD206+M2 macrophages. RESULTS: In vitro, B10 cells inhibit the expression of IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, and TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages while increasing the expression of CD206 and ARG-1. In experimental periodontitis, B10 cells inhibit the polarization of CD68+CD86+M1 macrophages and iNOS expression but enhance the polarization of CD68+CD206+M2 macrophages and ARG-1 expression. Importantly, the depletion of macrophages partially weakened the regulation function of B10 cells in periodontitis. CONCLUSIONS: B10 cells promote M2 macrophage polarization, inhibit M1 macrophage polarization in periodontitis, and alleviate periodontitis partially by regulating macrophage polarization."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Progranulin (PGRN), a multifunctional growth factor, plays indispensable roles in the regulation of cancer, inflammation, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, its immune regulatory role in periodontitis is insufficiently understood. This study attempts to explore the regulatory effects of PGRN on macrophage polarization in periodontitis microenvironment. METHODS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) and multiplex immunohistochemical (mIHC) stainings were performed to evaluate the expression of macrophage-related markers and PGRN in gingival samples from periodontally healthy subjects and periodontitis subjects. RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were polarized towards M1 or M2 macrophages by the addition of LPS or IL-4, respectively, and were treated with or without PGRN. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence staining (IF), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry were used to determine the expressions of M1 and M2 macrophage-related markers. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to detect the interaction between PGRN and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2). Neutralizing antibody was used to block TNFR2 to confirm the role of TNFR2 in PGRN-mediated macrophage polarization. RESULTS: The IHC and mIHC staining of human gingival slices showed a significant accumulation of macrophages in the microenvironment of periodontitis, with increased expressions of both M1 and M2 macrophage markers. Meanwhile, PGRN was widely expressed in the gingival tissue of periodontitis and co-expressed mainly with M2 macrophages. In vitro experiments showed that in RAW264.7 cells and BMDMs, M1 markers (CD86, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and IL-6) substantially decreased and M2 markers (CD206, IL-10, and Arg-1) significantly increased when PGRN was applied to LPS-stimulated macrophages relatively to LPS stimulation alone. Besides, PGRN synergistically promoted IL-4-induced M2 markers expression, such as CD206, IL-10, and Arg1. In addition, the co-immunoprecipitation result showed the direct interaction of PGRN with TNFR2. mIHC staining further revealed the co-localization of PGRN and TNFR2 on M2 macrophages (CD206+). Blocking TNFR2 inhibited the regulation role of PGRN on macrophage M2 polarization. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, PGRN promotes macrophage M2 polarization through binding to TNFR2 in both pro- and anti-inflammatory periodontal microenvironments."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin (EPO), which is clinically used for renal anaemia, reportedly exerts beneficial pleiotropic effects in atherosclerosis. This aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPO on macrophage inflammation and polarization under hyperglycaemic conditions and to identify the effects of EPO-treated macrophage supernatants (SNs) on endothelial cell (EC) function. METHODS: Peritoneal macrophages (pM\u03a6s) were isolated from normal, diabetic or EPO-injected mice. Pro-inflammatory factors were detected by qRT-PCR and ELISA, and macrophage phenotype markers were evaluated by flow cytometry. High glucose culture was used to mimic the hyperglycaemic microenvironment of diabetes mellitus (DM) in vitro. After exposure to various doses of stimuli, macrophage inflammation and phenotype were detected via ELISA, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. The underlying mechanism was investigated through western blotting. To examine the communication between macrophages and ECs, ECs were cultured with the SN of macrophages treated with different stimuli, and the tube formation ability of ECs was detected using Matrigel. The VEGF, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein expression levels were determined by western blotting, and the nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression levels were measured with a nitric oxide indicator and by ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: EPO treatment increased the M2 macrophage population and decreased the number of M1 macrophages. EPO decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-\u03b1, iNOS and IL-6. The JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway was also identified as being involved in the M1 macrophage transition. The SN of macrophages treated with EPO (SN-EPO) presented increased NO and ET-1 levels and decreased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels. Tube formation assays revealed that the SN-EPO promoted the ability of ECs to form capillary-like structures in vitro. In contrast, AZD1480, a JAK2 inhibitor, abolished this SN-EPO effect. CONCLUSION: EPO treatment alleviated the inflammatory reaction in DM mice and inhibited M1 polarization through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, EPO treatment promoted the tube formation ability of ECs in a VEGF-dependent manner and decreased the production of adhesion molecules, a vasodilator and a vasoconstrictor."

                "abstract": "Periodontal tissue destruction in periodontitis is a consequence of the host inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens, which could be aggravated in the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Accumulating evidence highlights the intricate involvement of macrophage-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of periodontitis under both normal and T2DM conditions. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (AZGP1), a glycoprotein featuring an MHC-I domain, has been implicated in both inflammation and metabolic disorders. In this study, we found that AZGP1 was primarily colocalized with macrophages in periodontitis tissues. AZGP1 was increased in periodontitis compared with controls, which was further elevated when accompanied by T2DM. Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of Azgp1 in the periodontium significantly enhanced periodontal inflammation and alveolar bone loss, accompanied by elevated M1 macrophages and pyroptosis in murine models of periodontitis and T2DM-associated periodontitis, while Azgp1-/- mice exhibited opposite effects. In primary bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS and palmitic acid (PA), overexpression or knockout of Azgp1 markedly upregulated or suppressed, respectively, the expression of macrophage M1 markers and key components of the NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3)/caspase-1 signaling. Moreover, conditioned medium from Azgp1-overexpressed macrophages under LPS or LPS+PA stimulation induced higher inflammatory activation and lower osteogenic differentiation in human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). Furthermore, elevated M1 polarization and pyroptosis in macrophages and associated detrimental effects on hPDLSCs induced by Azgp1 overexpression could be rescued by NLRP3 or caspase-1 inhibition. Collectively, our study elucidated that AZGP1 could aggravate periodontitis by promoting macrophage M1 polarization and pyroptosis through the NLRP3/casapse-1 pathway, which was accentuated in T2DM-associated periodontitis. This finding deepens the understanding of AZGP1 in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and suggests AZGP1 as a crucial link mediating the adverse effects of diabetes on periodontal inflammation."

                "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory oral disease that affects almost half of the adult population. NF-\u03baB activator 1 (Act1) is mainly expressed in immune cells, including macrophages, and modulates immune cells' function to regulate inflammation in inflammatory diseases. Macrophages play a vital role in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. However, the effect of macrophage-specific Act1 on periodontitis has not been investigated yet. This study aims to unravel the role of macrophage-specific Act1 on the pathophysiology of periodontitis. The expression of Act1 in healthy and periodontitis periodontal tissue was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Macrophage-specific Act1 expression downregulated (anti-Act1) mice were developed by inserting anti-Act1 antisense oligonucleotides after the CD68 promoter of C57BL/6 mice. Ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) was induced in anti-Act1 mice and wildtype mice. Micro-CT, histology, and TRAP staining analyzed the periodontal tissue status, alveolar bone loss, and osteoclast numbers. Immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and ELISA analyzed the inflammatory cells infiltration, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and M1/M2 macrophage polarization. mRNA sequencing of in vitro bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated peritoneal macrophages analyzed the differentially expressed genes in anti-Act1 mice during inflammation. Anti-Act1 mice showed aggravated periodontitis and alveolar bone loss compared to wildtype. Periodontitis-affected periodontal tissue (PAPT) of anti-Act1 mice showed a higher degree of macrophage infiltration, and M1 macrophage polarization compared to wildtype. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1), and macrophage activity-related factors (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) were robustly high in PAPT of anti-Act1 mice compared to wildtype. mRNA sequencing and KEGG analysis showed activated TNF/NF-\u03baB signaling in LPS-treated macrophages from anti-Act1 mice. In vitro studies on LPS-treated peritoneal macrophages from anti-act1 mice showed a higher degree of cell migration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, macrophage activity-related factors, M1 macrophage-related factors, and TNF/NF-\u03baB signaling related P-p65 protein. In conclusion, downregulation of macrophage-specific Act1 aggravated periodontitis, alveolar bone loss, macrophage infiltration, inflammation, and M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, LPS-treated macrophages from anti-Act1 mice activated TNF/NF-\u03baB signaling. These results indicate the distinct role of macrophage-specific Act1 on the pathophysiology of periodontitis possibly via TNF/NF-\u03baB signaling."

Regulation of macrophage polarization may be an effective target for periodontitis treatment, and A20 has a regulatory role in macrophage polarization. This study aimed to explore the effects of A20 on macrophage polarization in periodontitis and the underlying mechanism. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting A20 was exploited to achieve A20 knockdown or overexpression in periodontal tissues of mice with experimental periodontitis. The (AAV-A20-RNAi) +P group showed increased alveolar bone resorption when compared with PBS\u00a0+\u00a0P and CON305\u00a0+\u00a0P groups. However, the degree of bone destruction was reduced in the (AAV-A20) +P group relative to PBS\u00a0+\u00a0P and CON299\u00a0+\u00a0P groups. A20 knockdown resulted in enhanced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and decreased CD206 expression in mice periodontal tissues. In addition, higher levels of M1 macrophage polarization markers (iNOS, CD86, TNF-\u03b1) and lower CD206 expression were found in THP-1\u00a0cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) (Pg. LPS) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) when A20 was silenced. A20 overexpression showed opposite effects on macrophage polarization in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of A20 was correlated with upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in mice periodontal tissues or THP-1\u00a0cells. On the contrary, A20 overexpression inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. MCC950 suppressed M1 macrophage polarization aggravated through A20 knockdown in Pg. LPS and IFN-\u03b3 stimulated cells. Our data suggested that A20 inhibits periodontal bone resorption and NLRP3-mediated M1 macrophage polarization; A20 is expected to be a novel target for the treatment of periodontitis."

Complement 3 (C3) is closely related to complications of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the present study, we concentrated on whether C3 mediates the development of periodontitis in T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Levels of C3 in blood and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients were measured first. A C3-knockout diabetic mouse model was established, real-time PCR, Western blotting and histological investigation were performed to evaluate the progress of periodontitis. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and TRAP staining were performed to detect alveolar bone resorption. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect polarization of macrophages. RESULTS: Our data showed that C3 levels were elevated in the blood and GCF of T2DM patients compared with non-diabetic individuals. Increased C3 was closely related to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), as well as the decline of the bone volume density (BMD) and bone volume over total volume (BV/TV) of the alveolar bones in diabetic mice. The deletion of C3 inhibited inflammatory cytokines and rescued the decreased BMD and BV/TV of the alveolar bones. C3-mediated polarization of macrophages was responsible for the damage. CONCLUSION: T2DM-related upregulation of C3 contributes to the development of periodontitis by promoting macrophages M1 polarization and inhibiting M2 polarization, triggering a pro-inflammatory effect on periodontal tissues."

                "abstract": "Periodontitis is characterized by periodontal pocket formation, loss of attachment, and alveolar bone resorption. Both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in the pathogenesis of this oral chronic inflammatory disease. Accumulating evidence indicates a critical role of leptin in periodontal diseases. However, the mechanism by which leptin promotes periodontitis pathogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we observed an elevated expression of leptin in the serum of periodontitis mice compared to that in healthy controls. There was a higher extent of M1 phenotype macrophage infiltration in mice periodontitis samples than in healthy controls. A positive correlation was observed between the serum leptin levels and M1 macrophages. Treatment with leptin increased M1 macrophage polarization and decreased M2 macrophage polarization in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, leptin facilitated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 phenotype macrophage polarization in RAW 264.7 cells. In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) generated from leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob) mice, M1 macrophage polarization was significantly attenuated after LPS stimulation compared to the healthy controls. With regards to the molecular mechanism, we found that leptin activated the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and promoted M1 polarization via the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro. In BMDMs generated from Nlrp3-/- mice, M1 macrophage polarization was significantly attenuated after synchronous stimulation with leptin and LPS compared with BMDMs produced by healthy controls. The NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 also prevented leptin-mediated M1 macrophage polarization in RAW 264.7 cells. Nlrp3-/- periodontitis models indicated that leptin aggravates the periodontal response to the ligature by promoting M1 macrophage polarization via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, we show that leptin promotes the progression of periodontitis via proinflammatory M1 macrophage skewing, and targeting leptin/NLRP3 signaling may be a feasible approach for treating periodontitis."

This study was aimed to investigate the function of CTH and its relation to the macrophage polarization in periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wild-type (WT) and Cth knockout (Cth-/- ) mice were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro and pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Ligature-induced periodontitis was established on WT and Cth-/- mice. Histological analysis, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, immunostaining, and Western blot were performed to analyze the periodontium destruction and M1 macrophage polarization. RESULTS: Cth expression in BMDMs was upregulated upon increasing LPS stimulation. Deletion of Cth suppressed BMDMs inflammatory response with decreased Il1b, Il6, and Tnf mRNA. Cth-/- mice with periodontitis showed attenuated bone loss and impaired osteoclast differentiation compared with WT. Moreover, Cth knockout hindered M1 macrophage polarization, reduced the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in periodontally diseased tissue. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that CTH played an important role in regulating the inflammatory responses and periodontitis tissue destruction.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Dietary bioactive materials having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials are able to inhibit diabetes-associated periodontal complications. Although numerous studies indicate that administration of p-coumaric acid (p-CA) ameliorates diabetes and diabetes-related complications, the roles of p-CA on periodontal tissue destruction in diabetic mice and the possible mechanisms therein are not completely understood. In this study, we evaluated whether supplementation with p-CA protects mice against diabetes-associated spontaneous periodontal destruction and also explored the associated mechanism therein using in vivo and in vitro experimental systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice were divided into sham, streptozotocin (STZ), and STZ+CA groups (n\u00a0=\u00a05/group). Sham group was intraperitoneally injected with sodium buffer, whereas other two groups were injected with the buffer containing 160\u00a0mg/kg of STZ. STZ-induced diabetic mice received oral gavage with p-CA (50\u00a0mg/kg) (STZ+CA group) or with buffer only (STZ group) daily for 6\u00a0weeks. The effect of p-CA on diabetes-associated spontaneous periodontal destruction was evaluated using \u03bcCT analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, and immunohistochemical staining methods. The efficacies of p-CA on cell proliferation, osteoblast differentiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and antioxidant-related marker expression were examined using human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPLFs) cultured under high glucose condition. RESULTS: Streptozotocin group exhibited periodontal tissue destruction along with increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and osteoclast formation, as well as with decreased osteogenesis. However, oral administration with p-CA protected mice against STZ-induced periodontal destruction by inhibiting inflammation and osteoclastic activation. STZ+CA group also showed higher expression of antioxidant and osteogenic markers in periodontal tissue than did STZ group. Treatment with high glucose concentration (30\u00a0mmol/L) impaired proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of hPLFs along with cellular ROS accumulation, whereas these impairments were almost completely disappeared by supplementation with p-CA. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that supplementation with p-CA inhibits diabetes-associated spontaneous destruction of periodontal tissue by enhancing anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoclastogenic, and antioxidant defense systems in STZ-treated mice."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and AGE-mediated M1 macrophage polarization contribute to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) dysfunction, leading to impaired bone regeneration in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2), an endogenous bioactive peptide belonging to the calcitonin gene-related peptide family, exhibits various biological activities associated with the inhibition of inflammation and reduction of insulin resistance. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of ADM2 in AGE-induced macrophage M1 polarization, BMSC dysfunction, and impaired bone regeneration remain poorly understood. METHODS: The polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages was verified using flow cytometry analysis. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity detection, and alizarin red staining were performed to assess the osteogenesis of BMSCs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess polarization markers, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling, and osteogenic markers. In vivo, a distraction osteogenesis (DO) rat model with T1DM was established, and tibia samples were collected at different time points for radiological, biomechanical, and histological analyses, to verify the effects of ADM2 on bone regeneration and M2 polarization under diabetic conditions. RESULTS: ADM2 treatment reversed AGE-induced M1 macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, which was partially achieved by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3)-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. The PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor GW9662 significantly attenuated the effects of ADM2. Besides, ADM2 treatment improved the AGE-impaired osteogenic potential of BMSCs in vitro. Furthermore, ADM2 accelerated bone regeneration, as revealed by improved radiological and histological manifestations and biomechanical parameters, accompanied by improved M2 macrophage polarization in diabetic DO rats, and these effects were partially blocked by GW9662 administration. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ADM2 enhances diabetic bone regeneration during DO, by attenuating AGE-induced imbalances in macrophage polarization, partly through PPAR\u03b3/NF-\u03baB signaling, and improving AGE-impaired osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs simultaneously. These findings reveal that ADM2 may serve as a potential bioactive factor for promoting bone regeneration under diabetic conditions, and imply that management of inflammation and osteogenesis, in parallel, may present a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic patients during DO treatment."

Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by periodontal soft tissue inflammation and the progressive loss of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Macrophages are closely related to periodontitis progression. However, the role of BAFF in periodontitis development and macrophage polarization and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. METHODS: In vivo, a ligation-induced mouse model of periodontitis for BAFF blockade was established to investigate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. In addition, the level of TNF-\u03b1 in the periodontium, the number of osteoclasts, and alveolar bone resorption were observed. In vitro, RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were treated with 100\u00a0ng/mL Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P. gingivalis LPS) in either the presence or absence of 50\u00a0nM small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting BAFF, followed by further incubation for 24\u00a0h. These cells and supernatants were collected and stored for RT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: In vivo, BAFF blockade decreased the levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the periodontium in a ligature-induced mouse periodontitis model. Reduced osteoclast formation and lower alveolar bone loss were also observed. In addition, BAFF blockade was related to the expression of polarization signature molecules in macrophages. In vitro, BAFF knockdown notably suppressed the production of TNF-\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by P. gingivalis LPS. Moreover, BAFF knockdown attenuated the polarization of RAW 264.7 cells into classically activated macrophages (M1), with reduced expression of iNOS. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our limited evidence, we showed BAFF blockade exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties in mice experimental periodontitis in vivo and in P. gingivalis LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells in vitro, and macrophage polarization may be responsible for this effect."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The change of macrophage polarization state in inflammatory periodontal tissues (with bone loss) was examined using clinical gingival samples. The relationship between macrophage phenotype and bone level in periodontal bone loss and repair was evaluated using a mouse periodontitis model. The effect of GHANPs on macrophage polarization was assessed by the in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation. The polarization-related markers were detected by immunofluorescence staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. The therapeutic effect of GHANPs on alveolar bone loss was explored in experimental periodontitis by histological staining and micro-CT analysis. RESULTS: A lower macrophage M2/M1 ratio was observed in periodontitis-affected human gingival tissues. The results of animal experiments demonstrated a positive correlation between a lower Arg-1/iNOS ratio and accelerated alveolar bone loss; also, the proportion of Arg-1-positive macrophages increased during bone repair and regeneration. The administration of GHANPs partially restored M2 macrophage polarization after LPS stimulation. GHANPs increased alveolar bone repair and regeneration in experimental periodontitis induced by ligation, potentially related to their macrophage M2 transition regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that the induction of macrophage M2 polarization can be considered a viable approach for enhancing inflammatory bone repair. Additionally, GHANPs show potential in the clinical treatment of periodontitis."

METHODOLOGY: Macrophage polarization, IL-6/STAT3 expression, and the presence of P. gingivalis were detected in human AP tissues via RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry staining. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages were isolated and cultured with P. gingivalis W83 in vitro, and levels of macrophage IL-6 expression, STAT3 phosphorylation, and macrophage polarization with or without the selective STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor Stattic (5 \u03bcM) were detected via ELISA, western blotting, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry, respectively. P. gingivalis-induced murine AP models were constructed, and bone destruction and macrophage polarization in the apical region were evaluated. Transwell co-culture systems were used to investigate the effects of macrophages infected with P. gingivalis on osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. RESULTS: P. gingivalis was detected in human AP tissues that highly expressed IL-6/STAT3, and the M1 subtype of macrophages was more abundant in these tissues. P. gingivalis infection induced IL-6 expression, STAT3 phosphorylation, and M1 polarization of macrophages, while 5 \u03bcM of Stattic partially abolished these activation effects. Systemic STAT3 blockade via oral administration of Stattic at a dose of 25 mg kg-1 alleviated murine periapical bone resorption and apical infiltration of M1 macrophages induced by P. gingivalis infection in vivo. Furthermore, macrophages infected with P. gingivalis promoted bone destruction via secretion of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and RANKL, which hinder pre-osteoblast expression of Runx2 and accelerate pre-osteoclast expression of NFAT2. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in mediating macrophages M1 polarization in the P. gingivalis induced apical inflammatory context and may also be intimately involved in the bone loss caused by P. gingivalis infection, directing the M1 macrophage infiltration during the progression of AP."

                "abstract": "AIM: Rev-erb\u03b1 has been reported to regulate the healing of inflammatory lesions through its effect on the immune system in a variety of inflammatory disease. Moreover, the balance of macrophages polarization plays a crucial role in immune response and inflammatory progression. However, in refractory periapical periodontitis (RAP), the role of Rev-erb\u03b1 in inflammatory response and bone resorption by regulating macrophage polarization remains unclarified. The aims of the present study were to investigate the expression of Rev-erb\u03b1 in experimental RAP and to explore the relationship between Rev-erb\u03b1 and macrophage polarization through the application of its pharmacological agonist SR9009 into the in vivo and in vitro experiments. METHODOLOGY: Enterococcus faecalis-induced RAP models were established in SD rats. Histological staining and micro-computed tomography scanning were used to evaluate osteoclastogenesis and alveolar bone resorption. The expression of Rev-erb\u03b1 and macrophage polarization were detected in the periapical tissues from rats by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and western blots. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed to explore the relationship between Rev-erb\u03b1 and inflammatory cytokines related to macrophage polarization. RESULT: Compared to healthy periapical tissue, the expression of Rev-erb\u03b1 was significantly down-regulated in macrophages from inflammatory periapical area, especially in Enterococcus faecalis-induced periapical lesions, with obvious type-1 macrophage (M1)-like dominance and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, Rev-erb\u03b1 activation by SR9009 could induce type-2 macrophage (M2)-like polarization in periapical tissue and THP1 cell line, followed by increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. Furthermore, intracanal application of SR9009 reduced the lesion size and promoted the repair of RAP by decreasing the number of osteoclasts and enhancing the formation of mineralized tissue in periapical inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Rev-erb\u03b1 played an essential role in the pathogenesis of RAP through its effect on macrophage polarization. Targeting Rev-erb\u03b1 might be a promising and prospective therapy method for the prevention and management of RAP."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic disease with a complex etiology that includes bacterial colonization, excessive inflammation, and oxidative stress. The hormone melatonin has antioxidant properties and might contribute to alleviating chronic conditions by reducing oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of exogenous melatonin on periodontitis in an animal model of the disease as well as in patients with periodontitis. METHODS: In rats with ligature-induced periodontitis, melatonin was administered in drinking water for two weeks. In the human study, patients with treatment-resistant periodontitis were asked to rinse their mouths with a solution containing melatonin or placebo every evening for two weeks. Periodontal status as well as salivary markers of oxidative stress were assessed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Neither radiography nor \u03bcCT revealed any significant effects of melatonin on alveolar bone loss. Gum recession was the only improved macroscopic measure in rats (p < 0.05). Analysis of salivary markers of oxidative stress revealed no effects of treatment in rats or humans despite clearly elevated melatonin concentrations in melatonin treated groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the use of melatonin for the treatment of periodontitis. However, the negative outcome is limited by the short duration of the study and the chosen route of application as well as the dose of melatonin."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Psychological stress is a potential modifiable environmental risk factor causally related to the exacerbation of periodontitis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. This animal study aimed to investigate comprehensively the preventive efficacy of systemic melatonin administration on the possible effects of restraint stress on the periodontal structures of rats with periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, restraint stress (S), S-melatonin (S-Mel), experimental periodontitis (Ep), S-Ep, and S-Ep-Mel. Periodontitis was induced by placing a 3.0 silk suture in a sub-paramarginal position around the cervix of the right and left lower first molars of the rats and keeping the suture in place for 5\u2009weeks. Restraint stress was applied simultaneously by ligation. Melatonin and carriers were administered to the control, S, Ep, and S-Ep groups intraperitoneally (10\u2009mg/body weight/day, 14\u2009days) starting on day 21 following ligation and subjection to restraint stress. An open field test was performed on all groups on day 35 of the study. Periodontal bone loss was measured via histological sections. Histomorphometric and immunohistochemical (RANKL and OPG) evaluations were performed on right mandibular tissue samples and biochemical (TOS (total oxidant status), TAS (total antioxidant status), OSI (oxidative stress index), IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and IL-1\u03b2/IL-10) evaluations were performed on left mandibular tissue samples. RESULTS: Melatonin significantly limited serum corticosterone elevation related to restraint stress (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Restraint stress aggravated alveolar bone loss in rats with periodontitis, while systemic melatonin administration significantly reduced stress-related periodontal bone loss. According to the biochemical analyses, melatonin significantly lowered IL-1\u03b2/IL-10, OSI (TOS/TAS), and RANKL/OPG rates, which were significantly elevated in the S-Ep group. CONCLUSION: Melatonin can significantly prevent the limited destructive effects of stress on periodontal tissues by suppressing RANKL-related osteoclastogenesis and oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "Melatonin is an important antioxidant, and through its anti-inflammatory effects it can control immune responses, oxidative stress, and defense cell infiltration. Periodontitis is a disease of the oral cavity and the generation of free radicals is an important consideration in this disease. Therefore, we examined the immune-modulatory and antioxidant roles of melatonin in the treatment of periodontitis. In all, 30 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group, the periodontitis-induced (PED) group, and the periodontitis+melatonin treatment (MEL+PED) group. The control group received no treatment, whereas periodontitis was induced in both the PED and the MEL+PED groups, with the MEL+PED group being treated with systemic melatonin. For the periodontitis-induced groups, the rats' mandibular first molar teeth were ligatured (3-0 cotton) in a submarginal position for 4 weeks, and then the ligature was removed. After removal of the ligature, melatonin was administered only to the MEL+PED group (an ip dose of 10mg/kg body wt for 15 days at 11:00 PM each day). In the histological examination, the MEL+PED group, which received the melatonin, showed reduced inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, from 97.47 to 84.24pg/ml; TNF-\u03b1, from 0.22530 to 0.22519pg/ml), regulated oxidative stress parameters (MDA, from 41,458 to 30,708nmol/g; GSH, from 18,166 to 25,858nmol/mg), and less periodontal tissue destruction (CEJ-PL, lingual, from 244.54 to 140.57\u03bcm; buccal, from 235.6 to 158.93\u03bcm; and CEJ-BC, lingual, from 383.65 to 287.76\u03bcm; buccal, from 391.92 to 296.12\u03bcm). From these findings we conclude that, even when periodontitis was induced, melatonin reduced the oxidative damage in the rats' periodontal tissue by inhibiting the inflammatory effects and by restoring the antioxidants."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into six groups, as follows: control; experimental periodontitis (Ped); radiotherapy administration (Rt); experimental periodontitis and exposure to irradiation (Ped-Rt); radiotherapy and protective melatonin administration (Rt-Mel); and periodontitis, radiation therapy and protective melatonin administration (Ped-Rt-Mel). The rats were killed at the end of the experimental procedure, and the oxidative stress level and periodontal destruction were compared among the groups. RESULTS: The oxidative stress index and the levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were found to be significantly higher in the Ped-Rt group compared with the Ped group (p < 0.05), and the levels were lower in the Ped-Rt-Mel group than in the Ped-Rt group (p < 0.05). Alveolar bone destruction and attachment level were also significantly lower in the Ped-Rt-Mel group than in the Ped-Rt group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It was found that radiotherapy increased oxidative stress, the periodontal attachment level and alveolar bone loss, and protective melatonin administration significantly reduced the oxidative parameters and prevented periodontal damage in irradiated rats with experimental periodontitis. Further research is needed regarding the use of systemic melatonin administration before radiation therapy."

METHODS: Seventy Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, experimentally induced periodontitis (EP), DM, EP-DM, EP and melatonin treatment (EP-MEL), DM and melatonin treatment (DMMEL), and EP-DM-MEL groups. DM was induced by alloxan, after which periodontitis was induced by ligature for 4 weeks. After removal of the ligature, the rats in the melatonin groups (EP-MEL, DM-MEL, and EP-DM-MEL) were treated with a single dose of melatonin (10 mg/body weight) every day for 14 consecutive days. At the end of the study, all of the rats were euthanized, and intracardiac blood samples and mandible tissues were obtained for biochemical and histologic analyses. Serum levels of total oxidant status/total antioxidant status and OSI were measured. In addition, neutrophil and osteoclast densities and myeloperoxidase activities were determined in gingival tissue homogenates, and ABL was evaluated with histometric measurements. RESULTS: Melatonin treatment significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose levels in the rats with DM. In addition, reduced OSI and ABL levels were detected in the EP-MEL and DM-MEL groups; the reductions in the EP-DM-MEL group were found to be more prominent. Melatonin also significantly decreased the increased myeloperoxidase activities and osteoclast and neutrophil densities in the EP, DM, and EP-DM groups. CONCLUSION: It is revealed in this experimental study that melatonin significantly inhibited hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and ABL through antiDM and antioxidant effects in rats with DM and periodontitis."

Thirty Wistar Albino male rats were divided into four groups as follows: healthy + saline solution (Hs, n = 7), healthy + melatonin (Hm, n = 7), periodontitis + saline solution (Ps, n = 8), and periodontitis + melatonin (Pm, n = 8). Experimental periodontitis was induced using a ligature placed at the gingival margin of the maxillary second molars. Melatonin was applied intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg) every day for 2 weeks. After sacrificing the rats, serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels, and melatonin levels were evaluated. The Pm group exhibited lower alveolar bone loss than the Ps group. Melatonin levels increased in the periodontitis groups, and the Pm group had lower MDA levels and higher GSH-Px levels than the Ps group. These findings suggest that melatonin administration reduces MDA and increases GSH-Px levels in heart tissue, and these effects may be due to its antioxidant properties. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of melatonin on the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease."

METHODS: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, experimental periodontitis (Ep), and Ep-melatonin (Ep-Mel). Periodontitis was induced by placing 3.0-silk sutures sub-paramarginally around the cervix of right-left mandibular first molars and maintaining the sutures for 5\u00a0weeks. Then melatonin (10\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day, 14 days), and the vehicle was administered intraperitonally. Mandibular and kidney tissue samples were obtained following the euthanasia. Periodontal bone loss was measured via histological and microcomputed tomographic slices. On right kidney histopathological and immunohistochemical, and on the left kidney biochemical (malonyl-aldehyde [MDA], glutathione, oxidative stress [OSI], tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1, interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-8, MMP-9, and cathepsin D levels) evaluations were performed.

RESULTS: Melatonin significantly restricted ligature-induced periodontal bone loss (P\u00a0<0\u00a0.01) and suppressed the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), oxidative stress (MDA and OSI), and proteases (MMP-8, MMP-9, and CtD) that was significantly higher in the kidneys of the rats with periodontitis (P\u00a0<0.05). In addition, periodontitis-related histological damages and apoptotic activity were also significantly lower in the Ep-Mel group (P\u00a0<0.05). However, the markers of renal function of the Ep group were detected slightly impaired in comparison with the control group (P\u00a0>0.05); and the therapeutic activity of melatonin was limited (P\u00a0>0.05).

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subantibiotic doses of doxycycline (low-dose doxycycline [LDD]) have been widely used in periodontal treatment for enzymatic inhibition and related anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study is to verify the possible effects of LDD on oxidative stress in relation to periodontal attachment loss associated with ligature-induced experimental periodontal disease in rats. METHODS: Thirty female Wistar albino rats were divided into three study groups as follows: 1) control (C) rats; 2) rats with experimental periodontitis (PED); and 3) rats with PED that were treated with doxycycline (PED + LDD). PED was induced by placing ligatures around the cervix of the maxillary second molars for 21 days. The PED + LDD group was treated orally with doxycycline (6 mg/kg) for 21 days after the ligature was placed. After 21 days, the rats were euthanized, and samples of the right maxilla were defleshed and used for histologic and morphometric analyses. The gingival tissue of the left maxilla was used for the analysis of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde [MDA]) and antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase). Levels of serum total antioxidant status (TAS)/total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) were also analyzed. RESULTS: Alveolar bone loss was significantly higher in the PED group compared with the PED + LDD and C groups (P <0.05). Doxycycline exhibited the most prominent inhibition on gingival tissue levels of MDA and antioxidant enzymes (P <0.05). Doxycycline also significantly reduced TOS and OSI levels (P <0.05) but increased the TAS level. CONCLUSION: Doxycycline helps to prevent periodontal tissue breakdown by inhibiting local and systemic oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melatonin possesses antioxidant, free-radical scavenging, and immunoenhancing properties that promote fibroblast activity and bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to examine the possible links between salivary melatonin levels and the severity of periodontal disease using the community periodontal index (CPI). METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with different degrees of periodontal disease were studied. Salivary and plasma melatonin levels (by radioimmunoassay), salivary/plasma melatonin ratio, and CPI status were collected for each patient. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze relationships among variables. RESULTS: Data showed a significant correlation between CPI and salivary/plasma melatonin ratios. When saliva volume was controlled for, a significant correlation (P<0.05) was found between lower salivary melatonin and a worse CPI. This finding suggests that melatonin may act as a protector against free radicals produced by inflammatory periodontal diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Salivary melatonin levels varied according to the degree of periodontal disease. As the degree of periodontal disease increased, the salivary melatonin level decreased, indicating that melatonin may act to protect the body from external bacterial insults. Therefore, melatonin may be potentially valuable in the treatment of periodontal diseases, although further research is required to validate this hypothesis."

Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing and maintaining 3.0 silk ligatures at a peri marginal position on the left and right mandibular first molars for 5 weeks. Afterward, following the removal of ligatures, melatonin (10\u00a0mg/body weight) to Ep-Mel group, and vehicle (saline) to Ep and control groups were administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. On the first day of the eighth week, mandibular and cardiac left ventricular tissue samples were obtained following the euthanasia of the rats in all groups. Alveolar bone loss measurements were made on histological and microcomputed tomographic slices. Cardiac tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and cardiac Troponin-T (cTnT) were evaluated by appropriate biochemical methods. RESULTS: Measurements made on the histological and microcomputed tomographic slices showed that melatonin significantly limits the ligature-induced periodontal tissue destruction (P\u00a0<0.01).

                "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated that treatment with antioxidants improves hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Because our laboratory has shown that renal infiltration of immune cells plays a role in the development of hypertension (Rodriguez-Iturbe B, Quiroz Y, Nava M, Bonet L, Chavez M, Herrera-Acosta J, Johnson RJ, and Pons HA. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 282: F191-F201, 2002), we did the present studies to define whether the antihypertensive effect of antioxidants was associated with an improvement in renal inflammation. Melatonin was administered as an antioxidant. For 6 wk, melatonin was added to the drinking water (10 mg/100 ml) given to a group of SHR (SHR-Mel; n = 10), and we compared them with groups of untreated SHR (n = 10) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats (n = 10). Hypertension became increasingly severe in the SHR group [195 +/- 14.3 (SD) mmHg at the end of the experiment] and improved in the SHR-Mel group (149 +/- 20.4 mmHg, P < 0.001) in association with a 40-60% reduction in the renal infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, and angiotensin II-positive cells. Intracellular superoxide and renal malondialdehyde content were reduced by melatonin treatment as was the immunohistological expression of the 65-kDA DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappaB. We conclude that melatonin treatment ameliorates hypertension in SHR in association with a reduction in interstitial renal inflammation. Decreased activation of NF-kappaB, likely resulting from a reduction in local oxidative stress, may play a role in the suppression of renal immune infiltration and, thereby, in the antihypertensive effects of melatonin."

Periodontitis also progressively increases in patients receiving chemotherapy; however, the beneficial effects of melatonin and metformin on the alleviation of doxorubicin-induced osteotoxicity have never been investigated. Therefore, we investigated the negative impact of doxorubicin on alveolar bone homeostasis and the benefits of melatonin and metformin on the attenuation of doxorubicin-induced alveolar bone toxicity. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups to receive either 1 mL of normal saline solution as a control group, 3 mg/kg of doxorubicin, 3 mg/kg of doxorubicin plus 10 mg/kg of melatonin, or 3 mg/kg of doxorubicin plus 250 mg/kg of metformin. Doxorubicin treatment was given on days 0, 4, 8, 15, 22, and 29, while interventions were given daily on days 0 to 29. Following euthanasia, blood and alveolar bones were collected for evaluation of oxidative stress, bone remodeling, inflammation, microarchitecture, and periodontal condition. We found that doxorubicin increased systemic oxidative stress, decreased antioxidative capacity, increased inflammation, decreased bone formation, increased bone reabsorption, impaired microarchitecture, and impaired periodontal condition of the alveolar bone. Although cotreatment with melatonin or metformin resulted in some improvement in these parameters, cotreatment with melatonin was more effective than cotreatment with metformin in terms of decreasing oxidative stress, reducing bone resorption, and improving microarchitecture and periodontal condition. All of these findings highlight the potential for antioxidants, especially melatonin, to ameliorate doxorubicin-induced alveolar bone toxicity."

                "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a key factor regulating the systemic pathophysiological effects associated with periodontitis. Resveratrol is a phytochemical with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. We hypothesized that resveratrol may prevent the progression of periodontitis and reduce systemic oxidative stress through the activation of the sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant defense pathways. Three groups of male Wistar rats (periodontitis treated with melinjo resveratrol, periodontitis without resveratrol, and control rats with no periodontitis or resveratrol treatment) were examined. A ligature was placed around the maxillary molars for 3 weeks to induce periodontitis, and the rats were then given drinking water with or without melinjo resveratrol. In rats with periodontitis, ligature placement induced alveolar bone resorption, quantified using three-dimensional images taken by micro-CT, and increased proinflammatory cytokine levels in gingival tissue. Melinjo resveratrol intake relieved alveolar bone resorption and activated the Sirt1/AMPK and the Nrf2/antioxidant defense pathways in inflamed gingival tissues. Further, melinjo resveratrol improved the systemic levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, dityrosine, nitric oxide metabolism, nitrotyrosine, and proinflammatory cytokines. We conclude that oral administration of melinjo resveratrol may prevent the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis and improve systemic oxidative and nitrosative stress."

Thirty rats were divided into control, experimental periodontitis (EP), and experimental periodontitis-fucoxanthin (EP-FUCO) groups. Periodontitis was induced by ligature for four weeks. After removal of the ligature, the rats in the EP-FUCO group were treated with a single dose of fucoxanthin (200 mg/kg bw) per day for 28 consecutive days. At the end of the study, all of the rats were euthanized and intracardiac blood and mandible tissue samples were obtained for biochemical, immunohistochemical, and histometric analyses. Fucoxanthin treatment resulted in a slight decrease in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-6 levels and a significant decrease in oxidative stress index. It was observed that fucoxanthin caused a significant reduction in receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u03b2 ligand (RANKL) levels and a statistically non-significant elevation in osteoprotegerin and bone-alkaline phosphatase levels. There were no significant differences in alveolar bone loss levels between the EP and EP-FUCO groups. This experimental study revealed that fucoxanthin provides a limited reduction in alveolar bone resorption in rats with periodontitis. One of the mechanisms underlying the mentioned limited effect might be related to the ability of fucoxanthin to inhibit oxidative stress-related RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. "

One day after the ligation placements, Polycal (50, 25, and 12.5 mg/mL solutions at 200 \u03bcL/rat) was topically applied to the ligated gingival regions daily for 10 days. Changes in bodyweight, alveolar bone loss index, and total number of buccal gingival aerobic bacterial cells were monitored, and the anti-inflammatory effects were investigated via myeloperoxidase activity and levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. The activities of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were also evaluated. Bacterial proliferation, periodontitis, and alveolar bone loss induced by ligature placements were significantly inhibited after 10 days of continuous topical application of Polycal. These results indicate that topical application of Polycal has a significant inhibitory effect on periodontitis and related alveolar bone loss in rats mediated by antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative activities.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The role of oxidative stress in the process of cardiac remodeling, hypertrophy and heart failure is a current topic. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the influences of periodontitis on levels of cardiac oxidative stress. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty rats were separated into two groups: control and experimental periodontitis (EP). Periodontitis was induced by placing a 3.0 silk suture in the cervix of the left and right mandibular first molar teeth for 5 wk. At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed and blood samples and mandibular and ventricular cardiac tissue samples were collected. Levels of alveolar bone loss were determined using measurements performed on histological slices and radiographies. Left ventricular tissue 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, malonylaldehyde, glutathione peroxidase, total oxidant status, total antioxidant status (TAS) levels and serum paraoxonase-1 activity were evaluated biochemically. RESULTS: Measurements performed on the histological slices and radiographies demonstrated that applying the ligature caused obvious alveolar bone loss. Oxidative damage markers (malonylaldehyde, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, oxidative stress index: total oxidant status/TAS) were significantly higher, and antioxidant markers (glutathione peroxidase, TAS) were statistically insignificantly higher, in the hearts of rats with EP when compared to the controls. In addition, reduced serum paraoxonase-1 activity was also detected in the EP group. CONCLUSION: The pronounced increase in cardiac oxidative stress caused by periodontitis was due to an excessive increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, rather than due to decreased antioxidant capacity. The results indicate that periodontitis-related cardiac oxidative stress might be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the pathological process that leads to heart failure."

This study was undertaken to examine whether Polycan, a type of \u03b2-glucan, has a protective effect on ligature-induced experimental periodontitis and related alveolar bone loss in Sprague-Dawley rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: \u2002Polycan was orally administered, daily, for 10 d, at 21.25, 42.5 or 85 mg/kg, beginning 1 d after ligation. Changes in body weight and alveolar bone loss were monitored, and the anti-inflammatory effects of Polycan were determined by measuring the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in gingival tissue. We also evaluated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations as a measure of the antioxidant effect. RESULTS: Ligature placement led to a marked decrease in body weight, increased alveolar bone loss and increased concentrations of MPO, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MDA, as well as increased iNOS activity and inflammatory cell infiltration and decreased collagen-fiber content. Histological examination revealed increases in the number and activity of osteoclast cells, decreases in alveolar bone volume and elevated percentages of osteclasts on the alveolar bone surface. Daily oral treatment with 42.5 or 85 mg/kg of Polycan for 10 d led to significant, dose-dependent inhibition of the effect of ligature placement. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that 10 d of oral treatment with Polycan effectively inhibits ligature placement-induced periodontitis and related alveolar bone loss via an antioxidant effect."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress affects the progression of periodontitis. Cocoa is a rich source of flavonoids with antioxidant properties, which could suppress gingival oxidative stress in periodontal lesions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of a cocoa-enriched diet on gingival oxidative stress in a rat-periodontitis model. METHODS: In this 4-week study, rats were divided into three groups (n = 8/group): a control group (fed a regular diet) and two periodontitis groups (fed a regular diet or cocoa-enriched diet [10% of food intake]). Periodontitis was induced by ligature placement around the mandibular first molars. Serum levels for reactive oxygen metabolites were measured at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio were determined to evaluate gingival oxidative damage and antioxidant status, respectively. RESULTS: Rats with experimental periodontitis that were fed a regular diet showed an increase in the level of serum reactive oxygen metabolites in a time-dependent manner. These rats also had an increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine level and decreased reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio in the gingival tissue, inducing alveolar bone loss and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. Although experimental periodontitis was induced in the rats fed a cocoa-enriched diet, they did not show impairments in serum reactive oxygen metabolite level and gingival levels for 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio. Alveolar bone loss and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration after ligature placement were also inhibited by cocoa intake. CONCLUSION: Consuming a cocoa-enriched diet could diminish periodontitis-induced oxidative stress, which, in turn, might suppress the progression of periodontitis."

                "abstract": "Periodontitis (PD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by gingival inflammation and resorption of alveolar bone. Impaired receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) signaling caused by enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of PD. Considering melatonin possesses significant anti-inflammatory property, this study aimed to determine whether prophylactic treatment with melatonin would effectively normalize RANKL/OPG signaling, depress toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (TLR4/MyD88)-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine activation, and successfully suppress the pathogenesis of PD. PD was induced in adult rats by placing the ligature at molar subgingival regions. Fourteen days before PD induction, 10, 50, or 100\u00a0mg/kg of melatonin was intraperitoneally injected for consecutive 28\u00a0days. Biochemical and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect TLR4/MyD88 activity, RANKL, OPG, interleukin 1\u03b2, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels, respectively. The extent of bone loss, bone mineral intensity, and calcium intensity was further evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Results indicated that high RANKL/OPG ratio, TLR4/MyD88 activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were detected following PD. Impaired biochemical findings paralleled well with severe bone loss and reduced calcium intensity. However, in rats pretreated with melatonin, all above parameters were successfully returned to nearly normal levels with maximal change observed in rats receiving 100\u00a0mg/kg. As prophylactic treatment with melatonin effectively normalizes RANKL/OPG signaling by depressing TLR4/MyD88-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, dietary supplement with melatonin may serve as an advanced strategy to strengthen oral health to counteract PD-induced destructive damage."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experimental periodontitis (EP) was induced in 26 male Wistar rats by the insertion of a ligature around one of the first mandibular and maxillary molars. The animals were assigned randomly to the following groups: cigarette smoke inhalation (CSI; 3 times/d, 8\u00a0minutes/d)\u00a0+\u00a0resveratrol (10\u00a0mg/Kg), that is, SMK\u00a0+\u00a0RESV (n\u00a0=\u00a013) and cigarette smoke inhalation\u00a0+\u00a0placebo, that is, SMK\u00a0+\u00a0PLAC (n\u00a0=\u00a013). The substances were administered daily for 30\u00a0days (19\u00a0days prior and 11\u00a0days following EP induction), and then, the animals were euthanized. The maxillary specimens were processed for morphometric analysis of bone loss, and the tissue surrounding the first maxillary molars was collected for mRNA quantification of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) by real-time PCR. The gingival tissues surrounding the mandibular first molars were collected for quantification of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatase oxidase (NADPH) using an ELISA assay. RESULTS: Reduced bone loss was demonstrated in animals in the SMK\u00a0+\u00a0RESV group as compared to those in the SMK\u00a0+\u00a0PLAC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) group on the basis of morphometric analysis. Resveratrol promoted higher levels of SIRT and SOD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as well as reduced levels of NADPH oxidase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were found in tissues derived from animals in the SMK\u00a0+\u00a0RESV group when compared to those in the SMK\u00a0+\u00a0PLAC group. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol is an efficient therapeutic agent that reduces exacerbation of bone loss found in animals with EP that were also exposed to smoke. The results suggest that its effects could be mediated, at least in part, by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which attenuate the effects of oxidative stress on EP in the presence of cigarette smoke."

                "abstract": "Apical periodontitis is an inflammatory condition resulting from microbial invasion in the root canal system, causing periapical tissue destruction and bone resorption. This study investigated melatonin's effects, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, on experimentally induced apical periodontitis in rats. Three groups of rats were studied: control, apical periodontitis and apical periodontitis with melatonin treatment. Proinflammatory cytokines and enzyme levels in blood serum were measured, and micro-CT analysis assessed bone resorption. Results showed significantly elevated cytokines and enzyme levels in the apical periodontitis group compared to the control. However, in the melatonin-treated group, these levels were significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.01-0.001). Micro-CT analysis indicated decreased periapical resorption cavity volume and surface area with melatonin treatment. This suggests that systemic melatonin administration can mitigate inflammation and reduce bone resorption in experimentally induced apical periodontitis in rats, potentially holding promise for human endodontic disease treatment pending further research."

The objective of this study is to investigate the role of PGRN in uveitis and its counterpart, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: Serum PGRN levels in patients with Behcet disease (BD) or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and normal controls were measured by ELISA. EAE and EAU were induced in B10RIII, wild-type, and PGRN-/- mice to evaluate the effect of PGRN on the development of these 2 immune-mediated disease models. The local and systemic immunologic alterations were detected by ELISA, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. RNA sequencing was performed to identify the hub genes and key signaling pathway. RESULTS: A significantly decreased PGRN expression was observed in patients with active BD and active VKH. Recombinant PGRN significantly reduced EAU severity in association with a decreased frequency of Th17 and Th1 cells. PGRN-/- mice developed an exacerbated EAU and EAE in association with strikingly increased frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells and reduced frequency of regulatory T (Treg) cells. In vitro studies revealed that rPGRN could inhibit IRBP161-180-specific Th1 and Th17 cell response and promote Treg cell expansion. It promoted non-antigen-specific Treg cell polarization from naive CD4+ T cells in association with increased STAT5 phosphorylation. Using RAN sequencing, we identified 5 shared hub genes including Tnf, Il6, Il1b, Cxcl2, and Ccl2 and the most significantly enriched MAPK and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway in PGRN-/- EAU mice. The aggravated EAE activity in PGRN-/- mice was associated with a skew from M2 to M1 macrophages. DISCUSSION: Our results collectively reveal an important protective role of PGRN in EAU and EAE. These studies suggest that PGRN could serve as an immunoregulatory target in the study of prevention and treatment for the Th1/Th17-mediated diseases."

                "abstract": "Human uveitis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by ocular inflammation with the involvement of uveitogenic Th1 and Th17 responses. In experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), the animal model for human uveitis, both responses are proven to be critical in disease development. Therefore, targeting both Th1 and Th17 cells has therapeutic implication for disease resolution. IL-27 is a multifunctional cytokine that can either promote or inhibit T cell responses and is implicated in both autoimmune and infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to characterize the role of IL-27/IL-27R signaling in regulating uveitogenic Th1/Th17 responses in EAU. By immunizing IL-27R\u03b1-/- mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates for EAU, we demonstrated that IL-27 signaling deficiency exacerbated EAU with severe ocular inflammation and impairment of visual function. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the eye-infiltrating Th1 and Th17 cells in IL-27R\u03b1-/- EAU mice compared to WT. Their retinal antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were also significantly increased, as represented by the elevation of their signature cytokines, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A, respectively. We also observed the upregulation of another pathogenic cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), from effector T cells in IL-27R\u03b1-/- EAU mice. Mechanistic studies confirmed that IL-27 inhibited GM-CSF production from Th17 cells. In addition, the induction of IL-10 producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells was impaired in IL-27R\u03b1-/- EAU mice. These results identified that IL-27 signaling plays a suppressive role in EAU by regulating multiple CD4+ cell subsets, including the effector Th1 and Th17 cells and the regulatory Tr1 cells. Our findings provide new insights for therapeutic potential in controlling uveitis by enhancing IL-27 signaling."

Methods: An experimental AU (EAU) model was established with retina antigen and adjuvants. An EAU control group was established with adjuvant only to eliminate nonspecific effects. We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on cervical draining lymph node cells of EAU, EAU control, and normal mice to identify the EAU-associated transcriptional changes and the potential pathogenic molecules. Subsequent flow cytometry, adoptive transfer experiment, scRNA-seq analysis of human uveitis, and proliferation assessment were conducted to verify the function of the interested molecule in uveitis. Results: The scRNA-seq data suggested that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1\u03b1) may participate in EAU pathogenesis via regulating T helper (Th)-17, Th1, and regulatory T cells. Hif1\u03b1 inhibition alleviated EAU symptoms and regulated Th17, Th1, and regulatory T cell proportions. CD4+ T cells with repressed Hif1\u03b1 expression failed to transfer EAU to na\u00efve mice. In Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, which is a human uveitis, Hif1\u03b1 was also increased in CD4+ T cells and regulated their proliferation. Conclusions: The results indicate that Hif1\u03b1 may participate in AU pathogenesis and are, thus, a potential therapeutic target."

Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is a widely accepted animal model of human endogenous uveitis. In this study, we investigated the effects of diabetic conditions on the development of EAU using a mouse diabetes model. Methods: EAU was induced in wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice and Ins2Akita (Akita) mice with spontaneous diabetes by immunization with IRBP peptide. Clinical and histopathological examinations, and analysis of T cell activation state were conducted. In addition, alternations in the composition of immune cell types and gene expression profiles of relevant immune functions were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: The development of EAU was significantly attenuated in immunized Akita (Akita-EAU) mice compared with immunized WT (WT-EAU) mice, although T cells were fully activated in Akita-EAU mice, and the differentiation into Th17 cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells was promoted. However, Th1 cell differentiation was inhibited in Akita-EAU mice, and single-cell analysis indicated that gene expression associated AP-1 signaling pathway (JUN, FOS, and FOSB) was downregulated not only in Th1 cells but also in Th17, and Treg cells in Akita-EAU mice at the onset of EAU. Conclusions: In diabetic mice, EAU was significantly attenuated. This was related to selective inhibition of Th1 cell differentiation and downregulated AP-1 signaling pathway in both Th1 and Th17 cells."

Based on a network pharmacology strategy, we conducted protein interaction network analysis to construct an active ingredient-disease treatment network. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were further used to screen out the possible signaling pathways regulated by LXD in the treatment of uveitis. In the subsequent functional studies, we established an EAU rat model and investigated the regulatory role of LXD in the Notch signaling pathway and Th cell differentiation in rats with EAU. Female Lewis rats were randomly divided into a normal control (NC) group, an EAU group, and an LXD group. After the induction of EAU, the ocular inflammation and pathological changes in the rats in each group were observed; for documentation, a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) was used to observe fundus inflammation on day 12 after immunization. Additionally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the expression of Notch1, DLL4, IL-10 and IL-17A in the spleen, lymph nodes and ocular tissues of each group at 0, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 days after immunization. In addition, the dynamic frequencies of the CD4+, CD8+, Th17 and Treg cell subsets in the spleen, lymph nodes and ocular tissues were measured by flow cytometry. We found that the Notch signaling pathway was activated and the Th17 frequency was elevated in rats with EAU, leading to disrupted CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg balance. The expression of Notch1, DLL4 and IL-17 mRNA and proteins in the EAU and LXD groups reached a peak on day 12, and then gradually decreased (all P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the ratios of the CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg also peaked on day 12. However, after treatment with LXD, the expression of Notch1, DLL4 and IL-17 mRNA and proteins was significantly decreased (all P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg ratios significantly gradually returns to balance. LXD can efficiently inhibit Th17 cell differentiation, decrease inflammatory cytokine expression, and restore the CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg balance by inhibiting the activation of the Notch signaling pathway in rats with EAU, thus effectively alleviating eye inflammation, protecting eye tissue structures, and positively regulating the immune state of the whole body and the intraocular microenvironment."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) and STAT3 are implicated in uveitis and pathogenic mechanisms of CNS autoimmune diseases. In our study, we used miR-155(-/-) mice and mice with targeted STAT3 deletion in T cells (CD4-STAT3KO) to investigate roles of miR-155 and STAT3 in the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a mouse model of human uveitis. METHODS: We induced EAU in WT, miR-155(-/-), or CD4-STAT3KO mice by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein/complete Freund's adjuvant (IRBP/CFA) or adoptive transfer of T cells. EAU was assessed by funduscopy and histology. RNA expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), while cytokine production was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS: We used a combination of genomic and genetic tools to provide the first evidence that STAT3 binds directly to the miR-155 locus and that STAT3 is required for miR-155 expression. Furthermore, STAT3-dependent increase in miR-155 expression in vivo correlated temporally with onset of EAU, and miR-155(-/-) or CD4-STAT3KO mice did not suffer EAU. CD4(+) lymph node cells from IRBP-immunized WT mice transferred EAU to na\u00efve wild-type (WT) and miR-155(-/-) mice, while miR-155(-/-) IRBP-specific T cells did not. CONCLUSIONS: Although miR-155 and STAT3 have been implicated in the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), uveitis, or rheumatoid arthritis, their exact roles in these diseases are unclear. We show here for the first time to our knowledge that STAT3 regulates miR-155 expression in Th17 cells. We show further that STAT3 and miR-155 form an axis that promotes the expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells that mediate uveitis. Thus, STAT3 and miR-155 may be therapeutic targets for treating uveitis and other Th17-mediated inflammatory disorders."

                "abstract": "Uveitis is an immune eye disease that can seriously impair vision. Glucocorticoids (GCS) have been extensively used to treat uveitis, though the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effects of prednisone acetate (PA) on the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) through modulating the Notch signaling pathway. Briefly, Lewis rats were randomly divided into the normal control (NC), EAU, and EAU\u00a0+\u00a0PA groups. Rats in EAU and EAU\u00a0+\u00a0PA groups were induced EAU, while those in the EAU\u00a0+\u00a0PA group were treated with PA. Clinical and histopathological scores were employed to assess the progression of EAU. The expression levels of Notch signaling-related molecules (Notch1, Notch2, Dll3, Dll4, and Rbpj) and Th-associated cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17) were assessed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the frequencies of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells were detected by flow cytometry. These experimental results indicated that activation of the Notch signaling pathway occurred in EAU rats and resulted in a severe imbalance of the Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 ratios. PA treatment significantly alleviated ocular inflammation, inhibited activation of the Notch signaling pathway, and declined Th1, and Th17 cell differentiation, thereby restoring the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance. Collectively, PA can positively enhance the systemic immune response and improve the intraocular microenvironmental homeostasis by inhibiting activation of the Notch signaling pathway and by restoring Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, thus achieving the goal of treating uveitis."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: A small molecular compound, aminooxy-acetic acid (AOA), has been shown to modulate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The current study was designed to investigate whether AOA has a similar effect on the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and to further explore underlying mechanisms of this drug. METHODS: EAU was induced in C57BL/6J mice by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide 651-670 (IRBP 651-670). AOA (500\u03bcg or 750\u03bcg) or vehicle was administered by intraperitoneal injection from day 10 to 14 after EAU induction. The severity was assessed by clinical and histological scores. The integrity of the blood retinal barrier was detected with Evans Blue. Frequencies of splenic Th1, Th17 and Foxp3+ Treg cells were examined by flow cytometry. The production of cytokines was tested by ELISA. The mRNA expression of IL-17, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 was detected by RT-PCR. The expression of p-Stat1 and NF-\u03baB was detected by Western Blotting. RESULTS: AOA was found to markedly inhibit the severity of EAU, as determined by clinical and histopathological examinations. AOA can relieve the leakage of blood retinal barrier (BRB). Functional studies found a decreased frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells and an increased frequency of Treg cells in EAU mice as compared with controls. Further studies showed that AOA not only downregulated the production of the proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 but also upregulated the expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-10, which might be caused by inhibiting the expressions of p-Stat1 and NF-\u03baB. CONCLUSION: This study shows that AOA inhibits the severity and development of EAU by modulating the balance between regulatory and pathogenic lymphocyte subsets."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In multiple sclerosis (MS), the imbalance between T helper (Th)-17 cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical in autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and demyelination. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an established mouse MS model and simulates MS at diverse levels. OBJECTIVES: This study aims at investigating the impact of anlotinib on the clinical severity of EAE and CD4+ T cell differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EAE-induced mice were treated with water (control) or 6\u2009mg/kg anlotinib by gavage daily. At the peak of EAE, histopathological examination and flow cytometry analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4+ T cells were performed. In vitro differentiation of CD4+ T cells under different conditions was detected by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. Finally, the impacts of anlotinib on the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the transcription levels of key genes involved in Th17 and Treg differentiation were tested. RESULTS: Anlotinib attenuated the clinical severity of EAE and changed the frequencies of CNS-infiltrating CD4+ T cell subsets. Anlotinib inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells in\u00a0vitro, decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3, and reduced the expression of Rorc. Anlotinib promoted the differentiation of Treg cells and upregulated the expression levels of CD39 and CD73. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Anlotinib alleviated the symptoms of EAE via inhibiting the Th17 cell differentiation and promoting Treg cell differentiation. Our study provides new opportunities for the exploitation of anlotinib as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS."

                "abstract": "AS101 is an organotellurium compound with multifaceted immunoregulatory properties that is remarkable for its lack of toxicity. We tested the therapeutic effect of AS101 in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a model for human autoimmune uveitis. Unexpectedly, treatment with AS101 elicited Treg generation in vivo in otherwise unmanipulated mice. Mice immunized for EAU with the retinal antigen IRBP and treated with AS101 developed attenuated disease, as did AS101-treated recipients of retina-specific T cells activated in vitro. In both settings, eye-infiltrating effector T cells were decreased, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells in the spleen were increased. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that AS101 restricted polarization of retina-specific T cells towards Th1 or Th17 lineage by repressing activation of their respective lineage-specific transcription factors and downstream signals. Retina-specific T cells polarized in vitro towards Th1 or Th17 in the presence of AS101 had impaired ability to induce EAU in na\u00efve recipients. Finally, AS101 promoted differentiation of retina-specific T cells to Tregs in vitro independently of TGF-\u03b2. We conclude that AS101 modulates autoimmune T cells by inhibiting acquisition and expression of effector function and by promoting Treg generation, and suggest that AS101 could be useful as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune uveitis."

                "abstract": "Behcet's disease (BD) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome are two intraocular inflammatory diseases that are caused by an aberrant T lymphocyte response. Th17 cells, mainly producing the cytokine IL-17, and Th1 cells, characterized by the production of the index cytokine IFN-\u03b3, are the CD4(+) T lymphocyte subsets implicated in the pathogenesis of both BD and VKH. Suppressing the excessive response of these Th17 and Th1 cells has been reported to be an effective therapeutic approach to treat these patients and continuous efforts are being undertaken to find new methods to modulate the function of these cells. Evidence is emerging that the Liver X receptor (LXR) is an important regulator of inflammatory and immune responses and the study reported here was designed to investigate the role of LXR activation in BD and VKH. Here we demonstrate that the frequency of Th17 and Th1 cells along with the relevant cytokines IL-17, IFN-\u03b3 and corresponding transcriptional factors RORC, T-bet were all decreased following LXR activation by the agonist GW3965. LXR controlled the expression of inflammatory cytokines through an effect on NF-kappa B (NF\u03bab) phosphorylation. Data from our study provide evidence for an association between a decreased LXR expression and disease activity in both BD and VKH, due to the fact that a lower LXR activation may result in an enhanced Th1 and Th17 immune response. Our study suggests that enhancing LXR activation may offer a potential therapeutic approach targeting aberrant immune responses by inhibiting Th1 and Th17 cell responses. "

Progranulin (PGRN) is an immunomodulatory protein that is upregulated in SLE patients. However, the factors involved in regulating the pathogenesis of SLE by PGRN are largely unknown. We sought to investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of PGRN in SLE to develop a novel therapeutic target. We used an animal model of SLE that was induced in PGRN-deficient and normal wild type (WT) mice using pristane. PGRN concentrations were measured in SLE and the impact of PGRN deficiency was examined by measuring tissue injury and immune responses of T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg) and B cells. SLE patients and mice showed elevated PGRN levels. Compared with WT SLE mice, inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue edema, and necrosis were alleviated in PGRN-/- SLE mice and the levels of serum chemistry markers of tissue damage and the presence of anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-ribosomal protein P0 antibodies were all significantly decreased. We further discovered that PGRN deficiency could disturb the immune responses of T cell (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg) and B cell responses, leading to the decrease of inflammatory cytokines including interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-17A and increased levels of regulatory B cells. PGRN plays a proinflammatory role in the development of SLE partially through promoting the production of autoantibodies and enhancing Th1 and Th17 cell responses. This may provide new therapeutic options for patients with SLE."

                "abstract": "Uveitis is the most common cause in inflammatory eye diseases that can lead to visual impairment even blindness worldwide. T helper (Th) 17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical mediators for immune response. Notch signaling can regulate the cell differentiation, playing a role in the pathogenesis of the diseases. In this study, we measured the expression levels of Notch1, DLL4, IL-10, IL-17, ROR\u03b3t and Foxp3 in T cells from lymph node, spleen and eye tissues in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) rats in vitro, determined the ratios of CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of Notch signaling inhibitor N-(N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl))-S-phenylglycine t-Butyl Ester (DAPT) on Notch1, DLL4 expression and on Th17, Treg cell differentiation. The results indicated that the pathogenesis of uveitis accompanied by the elevated expression of Notch1, DLL4, IL-10, IL-17, ROR\u03b3t, and Foxp3 as well as the imbalanced CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg ratios. By contrast, inhibition of Notch signaling by DAPT can efficiently decrease Th17 cell response, downregulate the expression of Notch1, DLL4, IL-17 and the transcription of ROR\u03b3t, reduce Th17 levels and restore the CD4+/CD8+, Th17/Treg balance. Moreover, DAPT can also inhibit Th17 cell differentiation in healthy rats, though the inhibitory capacity of Th17, Treg differentiation is less than that in EAU rats. Overall, Notch signaling activation can lead to the disturbed Th17/Treg balance in uveitis, whereas inhibition of Notch signaling can ameliorate the inflammatory response and may be a potential immunoregulatory strategy in patients with uveitis."

                "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of interleukin (IL)-38 on experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: Mice with EAU were treated with IL-38, and the retinas and cervical draining lymph nodes (CDLNs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted to analyze the immune cell profiles of CDLNs from normal, EAU, and IL-38-treated mice. Results: Administration of IL-38 attenuated EAU symptoms and reduced the proportion of T helper 17 (Th17) and T helper 1 (Th1) cells in the retinas and CDLNs. In scRNA-seq analysis, IL-38 downregulated the IL-17 signaling pathway and reduced the expression of Th17 cell pathogenicity-related genes (Csf2 and Il23r), findings which were also confirmed by flow cytometry. In vitro, IL-38 reduced the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation function of IL-23 and inhibited IL-23R expression in Th17 cells. Moreover, when co-cultured with Th17 cells, IL-38 prevented IL-23 production in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the therapeutic effect of IL-38 on EAU, and suggest that the effect of IL-38 may be caused by dampening of the GM-CSF/IL-23R/IL-23 feedback loop between Th17 cells and APCs."

The immunomodulatory activities of melatonin have been shown to be beneficial under several conditions in which the immune system is exacerbated. Here, we sought to elucidate the basis of the melatonin protective effect on EAE by characterizing the T effector/regulatory responses, particularly those of the memory cell subsets. Melatonin was tested for its effect on Th1, Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells in the lymph nodes and CNS of immunodominant peptide of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (pMOG)-immunized and EAE mice, respectively. The capacity of melatonin to ameliorate EAE as well as modifying both T cell response and effector/regulatory balance was surveyed. T cell memory subsets and CD44, a key activation marker involved in the EAE pathogenesis, were also examined. Melatonin protected from EAE by decreasing peripheral and central Th1/Th17 responses and enhancing both the Treg frequency and IL-10 synthesis in the CNS. Melatonin reduced the T effector memory population and its pro-inflammatory response and regulated CD44 expression, which was decreased in T effector cells and increased in Tregs. The alterations in the T cell subpopulations were associated with a reduced mononuclear infiltration (CD4 and CD11b cells) of the melatonin-treated mice CNS. For the first time, we report that melatonin protects against EAE by controlling peripheral and central T effector/regulatory responses, effects that might be partially mediated by CD44. This immunomodulatory effect on EAE suggests that melatonin may represent an effective treatment option for MS. "

Here, we investigated the role of SLAT/Def6 in the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), an animal model for several uveitic conditions in humans. METHODS: SLAT/Def6 deficient (\"KO\") mice and C57BL/6 controls were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), along with pertussis toxin. The development of ocular inflammation was determined by both fundoscopy and histological examination. Lymphoid cells from draining lymph nodes were cultured with IRBP to measure lymphocyte proliferation and release of cytokines. Purified dendritic cells were tested for their capacity to present antigen to responding lymphocytes. In addition, the lymphoid cells were tested for the expression of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), using conventional methods, and the activity of T-regulatory cells was determined by their capacity to inhibit in vitro proliferative responses. Serum anti -IRBP antibody levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to determine the transcript levels of cytokines in inflamed eyes. RESULTS: SLAT/Def6 KO mice had significantly reduced EAU compared to controls. Cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of SLAT/Def6 KO mice exhibited impaired proliferation and production of Th1 and Th17 signature cytokines (interferon [IFN]-\u03b3 and interleukin [IL]-17, respectively) when compared with cells isolated from control mice. qPCR of inflamed eyes detected similar levels of IFN-\u03b3 transcript in control and SLAT/Def6 KO mice, whereas the IL-17 transcript levels in eyes of the SLAT/Def6 KO mice were lower than in eyes of the controls. The SLAT/Def6 KO mice resembled their wild type (WT) controls, however, in the levels of their serum antibody against IRBP, the antigen presenting capacity of their dendritic cells, the proportion of cells expressing Foxp3 and the immunosuppressive activity of their T-regulatory cells. CONCLUSIONS: SLAT/Def6 KO mice exhibit reduced capacity to develop ocular inflammation and cellular activity when immunized with IRBP. Our study provides new data showing that SLAT/Def6 plays a major role in the T cell-mediated autoimmune processes that bring about the inflammatory eye disease, EAU."

Currently available treatments for uveitis have exhibited profound adverse side effects. However, KS23 is a novel 23-amino-acid anti-inflammatory peptide derived from adiponectin that may have the capability to function as a safe alternative to these existing treatment options. We, therefore, evaluated the preventive effect of KS23 in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). METHODS: EAU was induced in mice via immunization with the peptide interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein 161-180 (IRBP161-180). KS23 was then administered every 2\u2009days via intraperitoneal injection to induce protection against EAU. Clinical and histopathological scores were employed to evaluate the disease progression. Inflammatory cytokines were also quantified using ELISA, and the expression levels of specific chemokines and chemokine receptors were assessed via qRT-PCR. In addition, the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells were detected via flow cytometry, and the expression levels of specific proteins were quantified from the retina of mice using western blot analysis, to elucidate the specific mechanism of action employed by KS23 to suppress the inflammation associated with EAU. RESULTS: KS23 was found to significantly improve EAU-associated histopathological scores, while decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-17A), chemokines (LARC, RANTES, MIG, IP-10), and chemokine receptors (CCR6 and CXCR3). The proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells were also suppressed following intraperitoneal injection with KS23. The anti-inflammatory mechanism employed by KS23 was determined to be associated with the activation of AMPK and subsequent inhibition of NF-\u03baB. CONCLUSIONS: KS23 decreased the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells to effectively ameliorate the progression of EAU. It may, therefore, serve as a promising potential therapeutic agent for uveitis."

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is an organ-specific autoimmune disease. This study was designed to phenotypically and functionally characterize peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells in VKH patients with active uveitis. METHODS: Blood samples were taken from 30 patients with active VKH, 19 patients with inactive VKH, and 26 healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were subjected to flow cytometry for analysis of phenotypes of the CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells. For functional analysis, CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells were separated by means of magnetic-assisted cell sorting and subsequently cocultured for 6 days. The proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells was measured by [(3)H] thymidine incorporation assay. The levels of IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-13 in the supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Significantly decreased frequencies of CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells and percentages of FOXP3(+) cells in these Treg cells were shown in patients with active VKH. Treg cells from patients with active VKH showed a significant deficiency in suppressing the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and inhibiting the production of IFN-gamma and IL-13 by CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells. CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells from VKH patients or healthy controls did not markedly inhibit or promote IL-17 production. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased frequency and diminished function of CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells is associated with active uveitis in patients with VKH syndrome. These results suggest that these dysfunctional CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of uveitis in VKH syndrome."

We investigated the pathophysiological role of IL-27 in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. METHODS: IL-27P28 and EBI3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were assayed by RT-PCR. Cytokines in the serum and supernatants of PBMCs, na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells and DC-T cocultures were assayed by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the frequencies of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells. RESULTS: The active VKH patients showed a decreased IL-27P28 mRNA expression in PBMCs and lower IL-27 expression in the serum and supernatants of PBMCs, but higher Th17 cells in PBMCs. EBI3 mRNA expression was not different among the groups tested. Stimulation of na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells under Th17 polarizing conditions showed a higher Th17 cell differentiation in active VKH patients. IL-27 significantly inhibited Th17 cell differentiation. IL-27-treated DCs showed a significant inhibition on Th17 differentiation. There was a significant defect in the Tr1 cell induction as measured by IL-10 in active VKH patients. Treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporine A (CsA) resolved the intraocular inflammation in association with an upregulation of IL-27 and a downregulation of IL-17. In vitro experiments showed that corticosteroids, but not CsA, significantly upregulated the expression of IL-27. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that decreased IL-27 expression may result in a higher Th17 in active VKH patients, which may promote the autoimmune response observed in these patients. Manipulation of IL-27 may offer a novel target for treatment of this disease."

The current study was set up to discover novel and non-steroidal small-molecule inverse agonists of ROR\u03b3t and to determine their effects on autoimmune disease. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was used to find compounds targeting ROR\u03b3t. Flow cytometry was used to detect the Th17 cell differentiation. Inverse agonists were intraperitoneally administered to mice undergoing experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or type 1 diabetes. The effects of the inverse agonists were evaluated by clinical or histopathological scoring. Among 1.3 million compounds screened, CQMU151 and CQMU152 were found to inhibit Th17 cell differentiation without affecting the differentiation of Th1 and Treg lineages (both P\u2009=\u20090.001). These compounds also reduced the severity of EAU (P\u2009=\u20090.01 and 0.013) and functional studies showed that they reduced the number of Th17 cell and the expression of IL-17(Th17), but not IFN-\u03b3(Th1) and TGF-\u03b2(Treg) in mouse retinas. Further studies showed that these compounds may reduce the expression of p-STAT3 by reducing the positive feedback loop of IL-17/IL-6/STAT3.

These compounds were also found to reduce the severity of EAE and type 1 diabetes.

METHODS: An EAU rat model was induced in Lewis rats, and pathology analysis was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. CD4+, CD8+, Th17, and Treg levels in spleen, lymph nodes and eye tissues were determined by flow cytometry. Meanwhile, the expression of Notch1, DLL4, IL-10, and IL-17 was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the inhibitory effect of N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl))-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) on Th17 differentiation by Notch signaling in vitro was further investigated using T lymphocytes from EAU rats on day 12 post-immunization by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The pathological results showed that inflammatory cell infiltration occurred in ocular tissues in EAU rats. The CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg ratios in EAU rats were apparently higher than those in normal control individuals. Q-PCR and ELISA analyses indicated the expression of Notch1, DLL4, IL-10, and IL-17 in EAU rats gradually increased on day 6 after immunization, peaked on day 12, and then gradually decreased. The dynamic trends in Notch1 and DLL4 expression in EAU rats were identical to those of CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg levels. DAPT can significantly inhibit the activation of Notch signaling, decrease Th17 cell differentiation, and attenuate the level of the Th17 cell lineage, contributing to the balance of the Th17/Treg ratio. CONCLUSION: The activation of the Notch signaling pathway can regulate Th17 and Treg cell differentiation, disrupt the CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg balance, and aggravate the severity of EAU; inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway contributes to the CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg balance in EAU rats. Our findings highlighted that the dynamic change in the CD4+/CD8+ and Th17/Treg ratio was consistent with the expression trend of Notch signaling in EAU rats, suggesting that Notch signaling may be a potentially important therapeutic target in clinical practice."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-grade inflammation, a common feature of both diabetes and periodontitis, partly accounts for the complexity and refractoriness of diabetes-associated periodontitis. Adiponectin (APN), the most abundant adipokine in human blood, has been widely reported to have anti-inflammatory functions. Herein, we investigated the ability of an APN receptor agonist, AdipoAI, to alleviate diabetes-associated periodontitis. Furthermore, we revealed the possible mechanism underlying its anti-inflammatory effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The maxillary first molar of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats was ligated to construct a diabetes-associated periodontitis model, and rats were administered AdipoAI by gavage. We examined diabetes-related indexes, pathological changes in insulin target organs, alveolar bone resorption and systemic and local inflammation. In vitro, transwell assays were used to evaluate monocyte/macrophage migration induced by human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) with/without AdipoAI treatment. Additionally, we examined chemokine expression levels in hGFs and hGF-induced monocyte/macrophage migration upon siRNA knockdown of Adiponectin receptor expression. Expression of Adipo1/Adipo2 receptors and inflammation-related signalling pathways were examined by IHC and WB, followed by confirmation with an NF-\u03baB P65 inhibitor (BAY 11-7082). KEY RESULTS: AdipoAI lowered fasting blood glucose and serum insulin in ZDF rats and alleviated inflammation in insulin target tissues. Locally, AdipoAI reduced alveolar bone absorption and gingival inflammation. Mechanistically, AdipoAI inhibited hGF-induced monocyte/macrophage migration by reducing CCL2 secretion. In hGFs, AdipoAI attenuated LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB P65 and CCL2 expression, which was dependent on the Adipo receptor 1. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: AdipoAI, with its ability to alleviate inflammatory damage in tissues, is a candidate for diabetes-associated periodontitis treatment."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated periodontitis is severe and refractory in many cases. Considered an inflammatory disease, T2D predisposes to periodontitis by increasing whole-body inflammation. One mechanism of increased inflammation is thatT2D is mediated by loss of production or function of the anti-inflammatory hormone adiponectin. In our previous report, AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, and AdipoAI, a newly discovered, more specific agonist, attenuated T2D-associated inflammation by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and LPS-induced endotoxemia. Autophagy plays an important role during osteoclast differentiation and function. The impact of AdipoAI on osteoclast function and autophagy involved in osteoclastogenesis is not known. Here, we compare AdipoRon and AdipoAI potency, side effects and mechanism of action in T2D-associated periodontitis. METHODS: The RAW 264.7 cell line was used for in vitro studies. We analyzed the potential cytotoxicity of AdipoAI using the CCK-8 assay. The anti-osteoclastogenic potential of AdipoAI was studied by real-time qPCR and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. The actions of AdipoAI involved in autophagy were tested by real-time qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. In the diet-induced obesity model of T2D, we investigated the impact of AdipoAI on fasting blood glucose, alveolar bone loss, and gingival inflammation in mice with experimental periodontitis. RESULTS: AdipoRon inhibited osteoclastogenesis and AdipoAI inhibited osteoclastogenesis at lower doses than AdipoRon without any cytotoxicity. In DIO mice with experimental periodontitis, AdipoAI reduced mouse body weight in 14\u00a0days, reducing fasting glucose levels, alveolar bone destruction, osteoclast number along the alveolar bone surface, and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in periodontal tissues. AdipoAI and AdipoRon also enhanced LC3A/B expression when cultured with RANKL.3-Methyladenine, a known autophagy inhibitor, decreased LC3A/B expression and reversed the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis during AdipoAI treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that AdipoAI ameliorates the severity of T2D-associated periodontitis by enhancing autophagy in osteoclasts at lower doses than AdipoRon without demonstrable side effects. Thus, AdipoAI has pharmaceutical potential for treating diabetes-associated periodontal disease."

                "abstract": "New consensus indicates type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis as comorbidity and may share common pathways of disease progression. Sulfonylureas have been reported to improve the periodontal status in periodontitis patients. Glipizide, a sulfonylurea widely used in the treatment of T2DM, has also been reported to inhibit inflammation and angiogenesis. The effect of glipizide on the pathogenicity of periodontitis, however, has not been studied. We developed ligature-induced periodontitis in mice and treated them with different concentrations of glipizide and then analyzed the level of periodontal tissue inflammation, alveolar bone resorption, and osteoclast differentiation. Inflammatory cell infiltration and angiogenesis were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and ELISA. Transwell assay and Western bolt analyzed macrophage migration and polarization. 16S rRNA sequencing analyzed the effect of glipizide on the oral microbial flora. mRNA sequencing of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) stimulated by P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) after treatment with glipizide was analyzed. Glipizide decreases alveolar bone resorption, periodontal tissue degradation, and the number of osteoclasts in periodontal tissue affected by periodontitis (PAPT). Glipizide-treated periodontitis mice showed reduced micro-vessel density and leukocyte/macrophage infiltration in PAPT. Glipizide significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation in vitro experiments. Glipizide treatment did not affect the oral microbiome of periodontitis mice. mRNA sequencing and KEGG analysis showed that glipizide activated PI3K/AKT signaling in LPS-stimulated BMMs. Glipizide inhibited the LPS-induced migration of BMMs but promoted M2/M1 macrophage ratio in LPS-induced BMMs via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. In conclusion, glipizide inhibits angiogenesis, macrophage inflammatory phenotype, and osteoclastogenesis to alleviate periodontitis pathogenicity suggesting its' possible application in the treatment of periodontitis and diabetes comorbidity."

                "title": "Resveratrol prevents alveolar bone loss in an experimental rat model of periodontitis.",
                "abstract": "Resveratrol is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenol. Periodontitis is induced by oral pathogens, where a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by oxidative stress is the major event initiating disease. We investigated how resveratrol modulates cellular responses and the mechanisms related to this modulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). We also explored whether resveratrol protects rats against alveolar bone loss in an experimental periodontitis model. Periodontitis was induced around the first upper molar of the rats by applying ligature infused with LPS. Stimulating hGFs with 5\u03bcg/ml LPS augmented the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and Toll-like receptor-4. LPS treatment also stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of several protein kinases in the cells. However, the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) was inhibited by the addition of LPS. Resveratrol treatment almost completely inhibited all of these changes in LPS-stimulated cells. Specifically, resveratrol alone augmented HO-1 induction via Nrf2-mediated signaling. Histological and micro-CT analyses revealed that administration of resveratrol (5mg/kg body weight) improved ligature/LPS-mediated alveolar bone loss in rats. Resveratrol also attenuated the production of inflammation-related proteins, the formation of osteoclasts, and the production of circulating ROS in periodontitis rats. Furthermore, resveratrol suppressed LPS-mediated decreases in HO-1 and Nrf2 levels in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Collectively, our findings suggest that resveratrol protects rats from periodontitic tissue damage by inhibiting inflammatory responses and by stimulating antioxidant defense systems. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The aims of this study were to investigate how resveratrol modulates cellular responses and the mechanisms related to this modulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) and protects rats against alveolar bone disruption in an experimental periodontitis model. Our findings suggest that resveratrol protects rats from periodontitic tissue damage by inhibiting inflammatory responses and by stimulating antioxidant defense systems. On the basis of our experiment studies, we proposed that resveratrol could be used as novel bioactive materials or therapeutic drug for the treatment of periodontitis or other inflammatory bone diseases like osteoporosis, arthritis etc. Furthermore, it could be also used for the modification or coating of implant materials as an antiinflammatory molecules which will help to accelerate bone formation. There are a few of reports suggesting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials of resveratrol. However, our results highlight the cellular mechanisms by which resveratrol inhibits LPS-mediated cellular damages using human-originated gingival fibroblasts and also support the potential of resveratrol to suppress periodontitis-mediated tissue damages. We believe that the present findings might improve a clinical approach of using of resveratrol on human, although further detailed experiments will be needed."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silibinin has shown various pharmacological effects that could be attributed to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory properties. However, the therapeutic potential of silibinin for periodontitis has not been investigated. METHODS: The therapeutic effects of silibinin in ligation-induced experimental periodontitis were investigated using biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical methods. The effects of silibinin on the osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells were investigated using TRAP staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), pit formation, and immunoblotting. Moreover, its effects on inflammatory cytokine production, RANKL expression, and oxidative stress in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were evaluated using qPCR and flow cytometry. A coculture system was established to elucidate the effects of silibinin on the crosstalk between LPS-stimulated HGFs and undifferentiated monocytes. RESULTS: Silibinin significantly reduced the alveolar bone loss, decreased the gingival inflammation and RANKL expression, and decreased the RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio in gingival tissues in experimental periodontitis. The in vitro results showed that silibinin inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and function of RAW264.7 cells and suppressed RANKL-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) induction and translocation through the nuclear factor-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Silibinin decreased the inflammatory cytokine level and oxidative stress production in LPS-stimulated HGFs; significantly suppressed membrane-bound RANKL expression on LPS-stimulated HGFs; and significantly disrupted TRAP+ cell differentiation in the coculture system. CONCLUSIONS: Silibinin effectively inhibits inflammation-induced bone loss in experimental periodontitis based on the regulation of stimulated HGFs by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic mediators. Collectively, targeting the inflamed HGF resolution that mediates osteogenesis may use silibinin as a potential drug-repurposing candidate for modulating alveolar bone destruction in periodontitis. SUMMARY: Silibinin effectively inhibits inflammation-induced bone loss in experimental periodontitis based on the regulation of stimulated HGFs by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic mediators."

                "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in adjunctive use of anti-inflammatory drugs to control periodontitis. This study was performed to examine the effects of pirfenidone (PFD) on alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis in mice and identify the relevant mechanisms. Experimental periodontitis was established by ligating the unilateral maxillary second molar for 7 days in mice (n = 8 per group), and PFD was administered daily via intraperitoneal injection. The micro-computed tomography and histology analyses were performed to determine changes in the alveolar bone following the PFD administration. For in vitro analysis, bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from mice and cultured with PFD in the presence of RANKL or LPS. The effectiveness of PFD on osteoclastogenesis, inflammatory cytokine expression, and NF-\u03baB activation was determined with RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. PFD treatment significantly inhibited the ligature-induced alveolar bone loss, with decreases in TRAP-positive osteoclasts and expression of inflammatory cytokines in mice. In cultured BMM cells, PFD also inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-a) expression via suppressing the NF-\u03baB signal pathway. These results suggest that PFD can suppress periodontitis progression by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory cytokine production via inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signal pathway, and it may be a promising candidate for controlling periodontitis."

                "abstract": "Periodontitis is twice as prevalent in diabetics as in nondiabetics, and type 2 diabetes (T2D)-associated periodontitis is severe in many cases due to the altered and aberrant functions of bone cells in hyperglycemic conditions. Therefore, developing an effective method to halt the disease process, as well as restore and regenerate lost alveolar bone to reserve the natural teeth in diabetics, is critically important. In the current study, we applied a newly discovered adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon (APR) in experimental periodontitis in diabetic animal models and demonstrated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that when APR systemically quenched the blood sugar level in diet-induced obesity (DIO) diabetic mice, it reduced osteoclast numbers and alveolar bone loss significantly due to APR's inhibition on osteoclast differentiation shown in our in vitro studies. APR also decreased the production of proinflammatory molecules CC chemokine ligand 2 and interleukin 6 in diseased gingival tissues. On the other hand, APR promoted alveolar bone regeneration through enhancing osteogenic differentiation and decreasing stromal cell-derived factor 1 in the bone marrow that facilitates stem cell migration. Same results were achieved by APR treatment of periodontitis induced in adiponectin (APN) knockout mice, indicating the ability of APR to activate the endogenous APN receptors to exert osteoanabolic effects. In summary, our study supports the notion that APR could be used as an effective multipronged approach to target T2D-associated periodontitis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is an increasingly prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus (known as diabetes mellitus-associated periodontitis), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25VD3 ) was recently found to be a critical regulator of innate immunity in this disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) is a potential downstream protein of the 25VD3 /vitamin D receptor pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of PTPN2 in periodontal inflammation in diabetes mellitus-associated periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Porphyromonas gingivalis-infected db/db mice were treated with 25VD3 . Their fasting blood glucose and body weight were monitored every other week, and the levels of alveolar bone loss and serum inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-6) were determined at the time of killing. The effect of PTPN2 on human OKF6-TERT2 oral keratinocytes was examined through the knockout of PTPN2 using the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout plasmid. The expression levels of the PTPN2, vitamin D receptor and JAK1/STAT3 signaling proteins in the gingival epithelium and OKF6-TERT2 cells were determined through western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: After 25VD3 treatment, db/db mice exhibited alleviated serum inflammatory cytokines and alveolar bone loss, and 25VD3 -enhanced PTPN2 expression decreased the expression of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling proteins in the gingival epithelium. Analyses of human oral keratinocytes showed that 25VD3 increased the expression of PTPN2, which dephosphorylates protein substrates in the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: PTPN2 contributed to a decrease in periodontal inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus via dephosphorylate protein substrates in the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway after 25VD3 treatment in human oral keratinocytes and a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A thorough understanding of PTPN2 and its involvement in inhibiting inflammation might provide alternative therapeutic approaches for the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes mellitus-associated periodontitis."

Slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2) has been shown to guide neuronal migration, regulate the inflammatory response and cancer progression. However, the role of SLIT2 in periodontitis is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the expression of SLIT2 in the gingiva of periodontitis and its role in periodontitis progression. METHODS: Gingiva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected from healthy people and periodontitis patients. Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to analyze SLIT2\u00a0secretion level. Healthy human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) were isolated and the expression of SLIT2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated hGFs was detected. The effect of SLIT2 on inflammation was analyzed using western blot and immunofluorescence. SLIT2\u00a0knockdown (KD) and overexpression assays in hGFs were performed to investigate the role of SLIT2 in the LPS-induced inflammatory response. RESULTS: Gingival tissues and GCF of periodontitis patients displayed higher expression of SLIT2. Similarly, SLIT2 was upregulated in hGFs in an inflammatory environment (LPS treatment). In addition, SLIT2 treatment increased the expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in hGFs. Mechanistically, SLIT2\u00a0stimulated the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling, as well as LPS. Lastly, SLIT2\u00a0KD impaired LPS-induced IL-6 production in hGFs, while SLIT2 overexpression amplified the inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: SLIT2\u00a0may be involved in the aggravation of periodontitis by activating NF-\u03baB signaling in hGFs."

                "abstract": "Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are risk factors for periodontitis and poor wound healing in diabetes, which have been associated with selective loss of insulin activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the gingiva. This study showed that insulin resistance in the mouse gingiva due to selective deletion of smooth muscle and fibroblast insulin receptor (SMIRKO mice) or systemic metabolic changes induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in HFD-fed mice exacerbated periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss, preceded by delayed neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and impaired bacterial clearance compared with their respective controls. The immunocytokines, CXCL1, CXCL2, MCP-1, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17A, exhibited delayed maximal expression in the gingiva of male SMIRKO and HFD-fed mice compared with controls. Targeted overexpression of CXCL1 in the gingiva by adenovirus normalized neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and prevented bone loss in both mouse models of insulin resistance. Mechanistically, insulin enhanced bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced CXCL1 production in mouse and human gingival fibroblasts (GFs), via Akt pathway and NF-\u03baB activation, which were reduced in GFs from SMIRKO and HFD-fed mice. These results provided the first report that insulin signaling can enhance endotoxin-induced CXCL1 expression to modulate neutrophil recruitment, suggesting CXCL1 as a new therapeutic direction for periodontitis or wound healing in diabetes. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: The mechanism for the increased risks for periodontitis in the gingival tissues due to insulin resistance and diabetes is unclear. We investigated how insulin action in gingival fibroblasts modulates the progression of periodontitis in resistance and diabetes. Insulin upregulated the lipopolysaccharide-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, CXCL1, production in gingival fibroblasts via insulin receptors and Akt activation. Enhancing CXCL1 expression in the gingiva normalized diabetes and insulin resistance-induced delays in neutrophils recruitment and periodontitis. Targeting dysregulation of CXCL1 in fibroblasts is potentially therapeutic for periodontitis and may also improve wound healing in insulin resistance and diabetes."

                "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a novel chemically modified curcumin (CMC 2.24) on NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling and inflammatory cytokine production in two experimental models of periodontal disease in rats. Experimental model I: Periodontitis was induced by repeated injections of LPS into the gingiva (3\u00d7/week, 3\u00a0weeks); control rats received vehicle injections. CMC 2.24, or the vehicle, was administered by daily oral gavage for 4\u00a0weeks. Experimental model II: Diabetes was induced in adult male rats by streptozotocin injection; periodontal breakdown then results as a complication of uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Non-diabetic rats served as controls. CMC 2.24, or the vehicle, was administered by oral gavage daily for 3\u00a0weeks to the diabetics. Hemimaxillae and gingival tissues were harvested, and bone loss was assessed radiographically. Gingival tissues were pooled according to the experimental conditions and processed for the analysis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and bone-resorptive cytokines. Activation of p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways was assessed by western blot. Both LPS and diabetes induced an inflammatory process in the gingival tissues associated with excessive alveolar bone resorption and increased activation of p65 (NF-\u03baB) and p38 MAPK. In both models, the administration of CMC 2.24 produced a marked reduction of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs in the gingival tissues, decreased bone loss, and decreased activation of p65 (NF-\u03baB) and p38 MAPK. Inhibition of these cell signaling pathways by this novel tri-ketonic curcuminoid (natural curcumin is di-ketonic) may play a role in its therapeutic efficacy in locally and systemically associated periodontitis."

We aimed to provide powerful evidence supporting the novel adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoAI in treating diabetes-associated peri-implantitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four ZDF-Leprfa/Crl rats were randomly allocated to three groups (N\u2009=\u20098). After feeding with a high-fat diet to establish diabetic rats, experimental peri-implantitis was induced by implanting titanium rods (1.5\u2009mm diameter and 20\u2009mm length) contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus into the femurs. Radiographic evaluation, microCT, histological analyses and qRT-PCR were used to detect inflammatory infiltration and bone destruction. In vitro, the inhibition by AdipoAI of osteoclastogenesis, including the number and function of osteoclasts, was investigated by TRAP staining, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were also utilized to explore AdipoR1, APPL1, NF-\u03baB and Wnt5a-Ror2 signalling molecules in this process. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used to compare the data. RESULTS: AdipoAI reduced inflammation and bone destruction caused by peri-implantitis in diabetic rats, which were manifested by a reduction in F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration by 72%, the number of osteoclasts by 58% and the levels of cytokines (p\u2009<\u2009.05) in disease group. In vitro, 1\u2009\u03bcM AdipoAI decreased the number of osteoclasts to 51%, inhibited F-actin ring formation and reduced the levels of related markers (p\u2009<\u2009.05).

CBD inactivated the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by inhibiting TLR-4 expression and p65 NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. CBD can be considered as a therapeutic agent for periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that CBD attenuates ligature-induced periodontitis in rats and LPS-induced inflammation in hPDLCs by inhibiting TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway activation. It indicates that topical CBD application is effective in treating periodontitis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies have confirmed that galectin-3 (Gal-3) levels are significantly elevated in periodontitis patients. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Gal-3 inhibition on periodontal inflammation in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) with or without Gal-3 knockdown were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and a ligation-induced mouse periodontitis model treated with a Gal-3 inhibitor was established. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were used to evaluate Gal-3 levels in gingival tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect Gal-3, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) expression. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to detect NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling pathway activation. Micro-computed tomography was used to analyse the degree of bone loss. RESULTS: Gal-3 was significantly up-regulated in inflamed gingival tissues and LPS-induced HGFs. Gal-3 knockdown markedly decreased LPS-induced IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 expression and blocked NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling pathway activation in HGFs. In the mouse periodontitis model, Gal-3 inhibition significantly alleviated IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 infiltration in gingival tissue and mitigated periodontal bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Gal-3 inhibition notably alleviated periodontal inflammation partly through blocking NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling pathway activation."

                "abstract": "Periodontitis is a complication of diabetes mellitus, and the two diseases are highly associated with the dysfunction of inflammatory mediators. 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) plays a pivotal role in inflammatory modulation, but little is known about its effects on the progression of diabetic periodontitis and the underlying mechanism. In this paper, we showed that 25(OH)D(3) ameliorated experimental periodontitis in diabetic mice. The intraperitoneal administration of 25(OH)D(3) to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice reduced fasting glucose and serum TNF-\u03b1 levels, leading to decreased alveolar bone loss. Western blot analyses of gingival epithelia showed that vitamin D receptor (VDR) and protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) were upregulated, while the expression of NF-\u03baB and the phosphorylation of Janus family kinase 1 (JAK1) were attenuated upon 25(OH)D(3) treatment. These data may provide an explanation for the therapeutic benefits and anti-inflammatory effects of 25(OH)D(3). Our findings should have important implications for the clinical therapy of diabetic periodontitis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease is the most common chronic inflammatory disease known to mankind (and the major cause of tooth loss in the adult population) and has also been linked to various systemic diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus. Based on the literature linking periodontal disease with diabetes in a \"bidirectional manner\", the objectives of the current study were to determine: (i) the effect of a model of periodontitis, complicated by diabetes, on mechanisms of tissue breakdown including bone loss; and (ii) the response of the combination of this local and systemic phenotype to a novel pleiotropic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, chemically modified curcumin (CMC) 2.24. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in adult male rats by intravenous injection of streptozotocin (nondiabetic rats served as controls), and Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) was repeatedly injected into the gingiva to induce periodontitis. CMC 2.24 was administered by oral gavage (30 mg/kg) daily; untreated diabetic rats received vehicle alone. After 3 wk of treatment, the rats were killed, and gingiva, jaws, tibia and skin were collected. The maxillary jaws and tibia were dissected and radiographed. The gingival tissues of each experimental group (n = 6 rats/group) were pooled, extracted, partially purified and, together with individual skin samples, analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography; MMP-8 was analyzed in gingival and skin tissue extracts, and in serum, by western blotting. The levels of three bone-resorptive cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1], were measured in gingival tissue extracts and serum by ELISA. RESULTS: Systemic administration of CMC 2.24 to diabetic rats with endotoxin-induced periodontitis significantly inhibited alveolar bone loss and attenuated the severity of local and systemic inflammation. Moreover, this novel tri-ketonic phenylaminocarbonyl curcumin (CMC 2.24) appeared to reduce the pathologically excessive levels of inducible MMPs to near-normal levels, but appeared to have no significant effect on the constitutive MMPs required for physiologic connective tissue turnover. In addition to the beneficial effects on periodontal disease, induced both locally and systemically, CMC 2.24 also favorably affected extra-oral connective tissues, skin and skeletal bone. CONCLUSION: This study supports our hypothesis that CMC 2.24 is a potential therapeutic pleiotropic MMP inhibitor, with both intracellular and extracellular effects, which reduces local and systemic inflammation and prevents hyperglycemia- and bacteria-induced connective tissue destruction."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease, characterized by periodontal pocket formation and alveolar bone resorption, is one of the most common oral diseases. Interleukin-37 (IL-37) is a novel inflammatory suppressor that plays an important role in many inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-37 in periodontitis DESIGN: A mouse model of periodontitis was established by Porphyromonas gingivalis. After four weeks treatment of recombinant human IL-37 (rhIL-37), the effects of IL-37 on the gingival index and tooth loosening degree of periodontitis mice were observed. H&E staining and micro-CT scanning were used to analyze the bone resorption of the maxillary. The number of osteoclasts was counted by TRAP staining and the differentiation of osteoclasts was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of inflammatory cytokines was detected by ELISA, and the protein expressions of the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway were analyzed by WB. RESULTS: RhIL-37 significantly decreased the gingival index and tooth mobility degree, inhibited maxillary bone resorption, decreased the number of osteoclasts and the expression of calcitonin receptor (CTR), periodontal cathepsin K (CTSK) and receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), and increased the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in periodontitis mice. At the same time, rhIL-37 significantly decreased the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and increased the expression of IL-10 in the gingival tissue of periodontitis mice. In addition, rhIL-37 significantly inhibited the protein expressions of p-p65, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 in periodontitis mice. CONCLUSION: IL-37 may alleviate alveolar bone resorption and inflammation response in periodontitis through the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effects of VnP-16 on osteogenic differentiation in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs), lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in gingival fibroblasts, and immune response in T lymphocytes. Ligature-induced periodontitis was induced by ligating the bilateral mandibular first molars for 14\u2009days in rats and for 7\u2009days in mice (n\u00a0=\u200910/group). VnP-16 (100\u2009\u03bcg/10\u00a0\u03bcl) was applied topically into the gingival sulcus of rats via intra-sulcular injection, whereas the peptide (50\u2009\u03bcg/5\u00a0\u03bcl) was administered directly into the gingiva of mice via intra-gingival injection. To evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of VnP-16, micro-computed tomography analysis and histological staining were then performed. RESULTS: VnP-16 promoted osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament cells and inhibited the production of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory mediators in gingival fibroblasts. Concomitantly, VnP-16 modulated the host immune response by reducing the number of receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-expressing lipopolysaccharide-stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and by suppressing RANKL and interleukin (IL)-17A production. Furthermore, local administration of VnP-16 in rats and mice significantly prevented and reversed alveolar bone loss induced by ligature-induced periodontitis. VnP-16 enhanced osteoblastogenesis and simultaneously inhibited osteoclastogenesis and suppressed RANKL and IL-17A expression in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that VnP-16 acts as a potent therapeutic agent for preventing and treating periodontitis by regulating bone re-modelling and immune and inflammatory responses."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine secreted from adipocytes that binds to APN receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and exerts an anti-inflammatory response through mechanisms not fully understood. There is a need to develop small molecules that activate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and to be used to inhibit the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia and other inflammatory disorders. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We designed 10 new structural analogues of an AdipoR agonist, AdipoRon (APR), and assessed their anti-inflammatory properties. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) were isolated from mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by reverse transcription and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microarray in LPS-induced endotoxemia mice and diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice in which systemic inflammation prevails. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), siRNA interference and immunoprecipitation were used to detect signalling pathways. KEY RESULTS: A novel APN receptor agonist named adipo anti-inflammation agonist (AdipoAI) strongly suppresses inflammation in DIO and endotoxemia mice, as well as in cultured macrophages. We also found that AdipoAI attenuated the association of AdipoR1 and APPL1 via myeloid differentiation marker 88 (MyD88) signalling, thus inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Maf pathways and limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced macrophages. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: AdipoAI is a promising alternative therapeutic approach to APN and APR to suppress inflammation in LPS-induced endotoxemia and other inflammatory disorders via distinct signalling pathways."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is intimately associated with the development of various systemic diseases, among which type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a bidirectional relationship with the pathogenesis of periodontitis. The objective of the present work was to investigate the role of berberine (BBR) in periodontitis with T2DM and related mechanisms. METHODS: The mRNA expression of macrophage polarization-related factors in the microenvironment of periodontal inflammation was detected using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The experimental periodontitis model was constructed in wild-type (WT) and T2DM (db/db) mice, which were administered BBR after 7\u2009days of modeling. Alveolar bone loss (ABL) in each group of mice was measured utilizing micro-computed tomography images. RT-qPCR was performed to analyze the levels of macrophage polarization-related factors in mouse gingiva. Lastly, using western blotting and RT-qPCR, the signaling pathway of BBR affecting macrophage polarization in the microenvironment of periodontitis was explored. RESULTS: BBR inhibited M1 polarization and stimulated M2 polarization in the periodontitis microenvironment. BBR decreased ABL in the WT and T2DM periodontitis models. And BBR reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in the gingiva of WT and T2DM model mice. Ultimately, BBR mediates its anti-inflammatory effects on periodontitis through inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: BBR had a therapeutic effect on T2DM-associated periodontitis via inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway to affect macrophage polarization, which may have implications for the new pharmacological treatment of T2DM-associated periodontitis."

                "abstract": "Genistein, a dietary polyphenol primarily found in soy products, has beneficial effects on bone. However, the effect of genistein on inflammatory periodontal destruction has not been investigated in detail. We explored whether genistein protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ligature-induced periodontitis in mice. We also examined the effect of genistein on LPS-stimulated inflammatory and oxidative stress using RAW 264.7 macrophages and human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). The results from \u03bcCT and histological analyses revealed that intraperitoneal injection of genistein (20 mg/kg body weight) daily for three weeks inhibited LPS-mediated alveolar bone loss and periodontal tissue degradation. The administration of genistein also inhibited osteoclast formation and the expression of inflammation-related molecules in the inflamed region of mice with periodontitis. Treatment with 30-70 \u03bcM genistein significantly prevented osteoclast differentiation in receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand- or LPS-stimulated macrophages by suppressing the expression of osteoclast-specific molecules. The addition of genistein led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the expression of inflammation-related molecules both in LPS-stimulated macrophages and hGFs. In addition, genistein at 50 \u03bcM protected hGFs from LPS-mediated stresses such as mitochondrial impairment and cellular ROS accumulation. However, such protection was significantly diminished by combined treatment with 25 nM bafilomycin A1, a chemical autophagy inhibitor. Collectively, our results indicate that genistein protects against inflammatory periodontal damage by regulating autophagy induction and inhibiting osteoclast activation, the production of inflammation mediators, and mitochondrial oxidative damage. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There is an unmet need to develop novel clinically relevant models of NSCLC to accelerate identification of drug targets and our understanding of the disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty surgically resected NSCLC primary patient tissue and 35 previously established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were processed for organoid culture establishment. Organoids were histologically and molecularly characterized by cytology and histology, exome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing analysis. Tumorigenicity was assessed through subcutaneous injection of organoids in NOD/SCID mice. Organoids were subjected to drug testing using EGFR, FGFR, and MEK-targeted therapies. RESULTS: We have identified cell culture conditions favoring the establishment of short-term and long-term expansion of NSCLC organoids derived from primary lung patient and PDX tumor tissue. The NSCLC organoids recapitulated the histology of the patient and PDX tumor. They also retained tumorigenicity, as evidenced by cytologic features of malignancy, xenograft formation, preservation of mutations, copy number aberrations, and gene expression profiles between the organoid and matched parental tumor tissue by whole-exome and RNA sequencing. NSCLC organoid models also preserved the sensitivity of the matched parental tumor to targeted therapeutics, and could be used to validate or discover biomarker-drug combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Our panel of NSCLC organoids closely recapitulates the genomics and biology of patient tumors, and is a potential platform for drug testing and biomarker validation."

This study aimed to establish a PDX repository for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to further elucidate whether it could preserve the heterogeneity within and between tumors in patients. Methods: A total of 75 surgically resected NSCLC specimens were implanted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice. Based on the successful establishment of the NSCLC PDX model, we compared the expressions of vimentin, Ki67, EGFR, and PD-L1 proteins between cancer tissues and PDX models using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining. In addition, we detected whole gene expression profiling between primary tumors and PDX generations. We also performed whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in 17 first generation xenografts to further assess whether PDXs retained the patient heterogeneities. Finally, paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin, atezolizumab, afatininb, and AZD4547 were used to evaluate the responses of PDX models to the standard-of-care agents. Results: A large collection of serially transplantable PDX models for NSCLC were successfully developed. The histology and pathological immunohistochemistry of PDX xenografts were consistent with the patients' tumor samples. WES and RNA-seq further confirmed that PDX accurately replicated the molecular heterogeneities of primary tumors. Similar to clinical patients, PDX models responded differentially to the standard-of-care treatment, including chemo-, targeted- and immuno-therapeutics. Conclusions: Our established PDX models of NSCLC faithfully reproduced the molecular, histopathological, and therapeutic characteristics, as well as the corresponding tumor heterogeneities, which provides a clinically relevant platform for drug screening, biomarker discovery, and translational research."

                "abstract": "CONTEXT: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has been one of the most frequent endocrine malignancies around the world. Although most PTC patients have a favorable prognosis, a subgroup of patients die, especially when disease recurrence occurs. There is a pressing need for clinically relevant preclinical thyroid cancer models for personalized therapy because of the lack of in vitro models that faithfully represent the biology of the parental tumors. OBJECTIVE: To understand thyroid cancer and translate this knowledge to clinical applications, patient-derived PTC organoids as a promising new preclinical model were established. METHODS: Surgically resected PTC primary tissues were dissociated and processed for organoid derivation. Tumor organoids were subsequently subjected to histological characterization, DNA sequencing, drug screen, and cell proliferation assay, respectively. RESULTS: We describe a 3-dimensional culture system for the long-term expansion of patient-derived PTC organoid lines. Notably, PTC organoids preserve the histopathological profiles and genomic heterogeneity of the originating tumors. Drug sensitivity assays of PTC organoids demonstrate patient-specific drug responses, and large correlations with the respective mutational profiles. Estradiol was shown to promote cell proliferation of PTC organoids in the presence of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), regardless of the expression of ER\u03b2 and G protein-coupled ER. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that these newly developed PTC-derived organoids may be an excellent preclinical model for studying clinical response to anticancer drugs in a personalized way, as well as provide a potential strategy to develop prevention and treatment options for thyroid cancer with ER\u03b1-specific antagonists."

Among all subtypes, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the most predominant malignancy in kidney. Clinicians faced a major challenge to select the most effective and suitable treatment regime for patients from a wide range of modalities, despite improved understanding and diagnosis of RCC. OBJECTIVE: Recently, organoid culture gained more interest as the 3D model is shown to be highly patient specific which is hypothetically beneficial to the investigation of precision medicine. Nonetheless, the development and application of organotypic culture in RCC is still immature, therefore, the primary objective of this study was to establish an organoid model for RCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with renal tumor and underwent surgical intervention were recruited. RCC specimen was collected and derived into organoids. Derived organoids were validated by histological examminations, sequencing and xenograft. Drug response of organoids were compared with resistance cell line and patients' clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that organoids could be successfully derived from renal tumor and they exhibited high concordance in terms of immunoexpressional patterns. Sequencing results also depicted concordant mutations of driver genes in both organoids and parental tumor tissues. Critical and novel growth factors were discovered during the establishment of organoid model. Besides, organoids derived from renal tumor exhibited tumorigenic properties in vivo. In addition, organoids recapitulated patient's in vivo drug resistance and served as a platform to predict responsiveness of other therapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: Our RCC organoid model recaptiluated histological and genetic features observed in primary tumors. It also served as a potential platform in drug screening for RCC patients, though future studies are necessary before translating the outcomes into clinical practices."

Personalised medicine represents a promising and effective therapeutic approach for this intractable disease. In this study, we aimed to establish a system for identifying and testing genotype-oriented targeted drugs for pancreatobiliary cancers by combining exome sequencing and organoid culture of primary tumours. METHODS: Tumour cells isolated from resected tumours were subjected to organoid cultures based on published protocols with modifications. Exome sequencing was performed on the primary tumours. Histopathological and molecular features of the primary tumours were validated in the corresponding organoids. Genotype-oriented candidate targeted drugs were identified from exome sequencing, and their efficacies were tested in the organoids. RESULTS: Organoid cultures succeeded in 30 of 54 (55.6%) cases. Six primary cancers of the biliary tract and gall bladder were subjected to exome sequencing, which revealed a variety of somatic mutations of genes involved in signalling pathways, epigenetic modifiers, genome maintenance\u00a0and metabolic enzymes. Most of the organoids of these 6 cases showed identical histopathological features and genomic aberrations as those of the primary tumours. Some of the aberrations were candidates for targeted therapies. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was one such candidate target, and an ILK inhibitor was confirmed to suppress proliferation of patient-derived organoids. CONCLUSIONS: By combining exome sequencing and organoid culture, our model enabled to identify genotype-oriented targets for personalised medicine and to test efficacies of candidate targeted drugs in the organoids. The current proof-of-concept approach could increase therapeutic opportunities for patients with pancreatobiliary cancers."

The concordance between tumors and PDOs in mutations in the top 20 NSCLC-related genes was >80% in five patients. Sample purity was significantly and positively associated with variant allele frequency (Pearson r = 0.82, P = 0.0005) and chromosome stability. The in vitro response to drug screening with PDOs revealed high correlation with the mutation profiles in the primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS: PDOs are highly credible models for detecting NSCLC and for prospective prediction of the treatment response for personalized precision medicine. KEY POINTS: Lung cancer organoid models could save precious time of drug testing on patients, and accurately select anticancer drugs according to the drug sensitivity results, so as to provide a powerful supplement and verification for the gene sequencing."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Depending on its histological subtype, salivary gland carcinoma (SGC) may have a poor prognosis. Due to the scarcity of preclinical experimental models, its molecular biology has so far remained largely unknown, hampering the development of new treatment modalities for patients with these malignancies. The aim of this study was to generate experimental human SGC models of multiple histological subtypes using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid culture techniques. METHODS: Tumor specimens from surgically resected SGCs were processed for the preparation of PDXs and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Specimens from SGC PDXs were also processed for PDX-derived organoid (PDXO) generation. In vivo tumorigenicity was assessed using orthotopic transplantation of SGC organoids. The pathological characteristics of each model were compared to those of the original tumors using immunohistochemistry. RNA-seq was used to analyze the genetic traits of our models. RESULTS: Three series of PDOs, PDXs and PDXOs of salivary duct carcinomas, one series of PDOs, PDXs and PDXOs of mucoepidermoid carcinomas and PDXs of myoepithelial carcinomas were successfully generated. We found that PDXs and orthotopic transplants from PDOs/PDXOs showed similar histological features as the original tumors. Our models also retained their genetic traits, i.e., transcription profiles, genomic variants and fusion genes of the corresponding histological subtypes. CONCLUSION: We report the generation of SGC PDOs, PDXs and PDXOs of multiple histological subtypes, recapitulating the histological and genetical characteristics of the original tumors. These experimental SGC models may serve as a useful resource for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these malignancies."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The relevance of patient-derived cancer cells has been recently increasing, particularly in terms of drug discovery and precision medicine. Whereas Matrigel-based organoid culture is a promising technique that enables infinite proliferation of cells from many types of organs in a physiological condition, its validity in gynecologic tumors remains to be established. To address this issue, we aimed at developing an efficient method for organoid culture of both ovarian and endometrial tumors. METHODS: We conducted 3D culture of 21 gynecologic tumors following our original and modified protocol for Matrigel bilayer organoid culture. We investigated whether propagated organoids retained various features of the original tumors by histopathological examination and targeted genome sequencing. RESULTS: We customized the protocol we previously optimized for murine normal and cancer tissues, so as to circumvent the digestion-resistant nature inherent to gynecologic tumors. Indeed, this modified protocol improved the success rate from 45 to 90%, for robust propagation of organoids from tumors with various stages and subtypes. Finally, 14 patient-derived organoids were established. The recovered organoids were enriched for cancer cells that retained many aspects of the original tumors, including histological features, mutation profiles, and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. A subset of the expanded organoids could develop xenografts in immunodeficient mice, potentially paving the way to drug screening in vivo. Drug response assay in vitro for paclitaxel and cisplatin was feasible using organoid-derived spheroids. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that patient-derived organoids closely resembled the original gynecologic tumors, and thereby would serve as a promising resource for preclinical studies."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical models that can better predict therapeutic activity in clinical trials are needed in this era of personalized cancer treatment. Herein, we established genomically and clinically annotated patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and investigated whether these PDXs would faithfully recapitulate patient responses to targeted therapy. METHODS: Patient-derived tumors were implanted in immunodeficient mice and subsequently expanded via re-implantation. Established PDXs were examined by light microscopy, genomic profiling, and in vivo drug testing, and the successful engraft rate was analyzed with the mutation profile, histology, or acquisition method. Finally, the drug responses of PDXs were compared with the clinical responses of the respective patients. RESULTS: Using samples from 122 patients, we established 41 NSCLC PDXs [30 adenocarcinoma (AD), 11 squamous cell carcinoma (SQ)], among which the following driver mutation were observed: 13 EGFR-mutant, 4 ALK-rearrangement, 1 ROS1-rearrangement, 1 PIK3CA-mutant, 1 FGFR1-amplification, and 2 KRAS-mutant. We rigorously characterized the relationship of clinical features to engraftment rate and latency rates. The engraft rates were comparable across histologic type. The AD engraft rate tended to be higher for surgically resected tissues relative to biopsies, whereas similar engraft rates was observed for SQ, irrespective of the acquisition method. Notably, EGFR-mutants demonstrated significantly longer latency time than EGFR-WT (86 vs. 37days, P\u2009=\u20090.007). The clinical responses were recapitulated by PDXs harboring driver gene alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or FGFR1) which regressed to their target inhibitors, suggesting that established PDXs comprise a clinically relevant platform. CONCLUSION: The establishment of genetically and clinically annotated NSCLC PDXs can yield a robust preclinical tool for biomarker, therapeutic target, and drug discovery."

Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) are considered to be interesting candidates. However, the establishment of such model systems requires highly specialized research facilities and introduces logistic challenges. We aimed to establish an extensive well-characterized panel of NSCLC xenograft models in the context of a long-distance research network after careful control of the preanalytical steps. One hundred fresh surgically resected NSCLC specimens were shipped in survival medium at room temperature from a hospital-integrated biobank to animal facilities. Within 24\u00a0h post-surgery, tumor fragments were subcutaneously xenografted into immunodeficient mice. PDX characterization was performed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, aCGH and next-generation sequencing approaches. For this model system, the tumor take rate was 35%, with higher rates for squamous carcinoma (60%) than for adenocarcinoma (13%). Patients for whom PDX tumors were obtained had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients for whom no PDX tumors (P\u00a0=\u00a00.039) were obtained. We established a large panel of PDX NSCLC models with a high frequency of mutations (29%) in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MEK1, BRAF, PTEN, and PI3KCA genes and with gene amplification (20%) of c-MET and FGFR1. This new patient-derived NSCLC xenograft collection, established regardless of the considerable time required and the distance between the clinic and the animal facilities, recapitulated the histopathology and molecular diversity of NSCLC and provides stable and reliable preclinical models for human lung cancer research.

We recently described a novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from three of the most common PLC subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC) tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture, gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as a potential therapeutic agent for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the disease."

Gene expression profiling of the organoids revealed that SOX2 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with BTC. We screened a compound library consisting of drugs used clinically for their ability to suppress organoids derived from BTCs and found that the antifungal drugs amorolfine and fenticonazole significantly suppressed the growth of organoids derived from BTCs with minimal toxicity to normal biliary epithelial cells.

Dog BC resembles human muscle-invasive BC in histopathological characteristics and gene expression profiles, and could be an important research model for this disease. Cancer patient-derived organoid culture can recapitulate organ structures and maintains the gene expression profiles of original tumor tissues. In a previous study, we generated dog prostate cancer organoids using urine samples, however dog BC organoids had never been produced. Therefore we aimed to generate dog BC organoids using urine samples and check their histopathological characteristics, drug sensitivity, and gene expression profiles. Organoids from individual BC dogs were successfully generated, expressed urothelial cell markers (CK7, CK20, and UPK3A) and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. In a cell viability assay, the response to combined treatment with a range of anticancer drugs (cisplatin, vinblastine, gemcitabine or piroxicam) was markedly different in each BC organoid. In RNA-sequencing analysis, expression levels of basal cell markers (CK5 and DSG3) and several novel genes (MMP28, CTSE, CNN3, TFPI2, COL17A1, and AGPAT4) were upregulated in BC organoids compared with normal bladder tissues or two-dimensional (2D) BC cell lines. These established dog BC organoids might be a useful tool, not only to determine suitable chemotherapy for BC diseased dogs but also to identify novel biomarkers in human muscle-invasive BC. In the present study, for the 1st time, dog BC organoids were generated and several specifically upregulated organoid genes were identified. Our data suggest that dog BC organoids might become a new tool to provide fresh insights into both dog BC therapy and diagnostic biomarkers."

Here, we describe conditions for long-term culture of human mucosal organoids. Using this protocol, a panel of 31 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-derived organoid lines was established. This panel recapitulates genetic and molecular characteristics previously described for HNSCC. Organoids retain their tumorigenic potential upon xenotransplantation. We observe differential responses to a panel of drugs including cisplatin, carboplatin, cetuximab, and radiotherapy in vitro. Additionally, drug screens reveal selective sensitivity to targeted drugs that are not normally used in the treatment of patients with HNSCC. These observations may inspire a personalized approach to the management of HNSCC and expand the repertoire of HNSCC drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes the culture of organoids derived from HNSCC and corresponding normal epithelium. These tumoroids recapitulate the disease genetically, histologically, and functionally. In vitro drug screening of tumoroids reveals responses to therapies both currently used in the treatment of HNSCC and those not (yet) used in clinical practice.See related commentary by Hill and D'Andrea, p. 828.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813."

We report a specific relationship between area under the curve value of organoid drug dose response and in vivo tumor growth, irrespective of the drug treatment. In addition, we analyzed the glycome of PDX and PXO models and demonstrate that PXOs recapitulate the in vivo glycan landscape. In addition, we identify a core set of 57 N-glycans detected in all 10 models that represent 50%-94% of the relative abundance of all N-glycans detected in each of the models. Last, we developed a secreted biomarker discovery pipeline using media supernatant of organoid cultures and identified potentially new extracellular vesicle (EV) protein markers. We validated our findings using plasma samples from patients with PDAC, benign gastrointestinal diseases, and chronic pancreatitis and discovered that 4 EV proteins are potential circulating biomarkers for PDAC. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of organoid cultures to not only model in vivo drug responses but also serve as a powerful platform for discovering clinically actionable serologic biomarkers."

PDX susceptibility to anti-cancer drugs is closely correlated with clinical data in patients, from whom PDX models have been derived. Accumulating evidence suggests that PDX models are highly effective in predicting the efficacy of both conventional and novel anti-cancer therapeutics. This also allows \"co-clinical trials,\" in which pre-clinical investigations in vivo and clinical trials could be performed in parallel or sequentially to assess drug efficacy in patients and PDXs. However, tumor heterogeneity present in PDX models and in the original tumor samples constitutes an obstacle for application of PDX models. Moreover, human stromal cells originally present in tumors dissected from patients are gradually replaced by host stromal cells as the xenograft grows. This replacement by murine stroma could preclude analysis of human tumor-stroma interactions, as some mouse stromal cytokines might not affect human carcinoma cells in PDX models. The present review highlights the biological and clinical significance of PDX models and three-dimensional patient-derived tumor organoid cultures of several kinds of solid tumors, such as those of the colon, pancreas, brain, breast, lung, skin, and ovary."

Patient tumor and PDX were processed for analysis of copy number variations by aCGH, gene expression by microarray, and expression of target pathways by immunohistochemistry (IHC). One PDX harbouring an FGFR3 mutation was treated with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody targeting FGFR3. Five PDX were successfully established. Tumor doubling time ranged from 5 to 11 days. Array CGH revealed shared chromosomal aberrations in the patient tumors and PDX. Gene expression microarray and IHC confirmed that PDXs maintain similar patterns to the parental tumors. Tumor growth in the PDX with an FGFR3 mutation was inhibited by the FGFR3 inhibitor. PDXs recapitulate the tumor biology of the patients' primary tumors from which they are derived. Investigations related to tumor biology and drug testing in these models are therefore more likely to be relevant to the disease state in patients.

Although isolation and culture of patient-derived pancreatic organoids were established several years ago, pros and cons for individualized medicine have not been comprehensively investigated to date. METHODS: We conducted a feasibility study, systematically comparing head-to-head patient-derived xenograft tumor (PDX) and PDX-derived organoids by rigorous immunohistochemical and molecular characterization. Subsequently, a drug testing platform was set up and validated in\u00a0vivo. Patient-derived organoids were investigated as well. RESULTS: First, PDOs faithfully recapitulated the morphology and marker protein expression patterns of the PDXs. Second, quantitative proteomes from the PDX as well as from corresponding organoid cultures showed high concordance. Third, genomic alterations, as assessed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, revealed similar results in both groups. Fourth, we established a small-scale pharmacotyping platform adjusted to operate in parallel considering potential obstacles such as culture conditions, timing, drug dosing, and interpretation of the results. In\u00a0vitro predictions were successfully validated in an in\u00a0vivo xenograft trial. Translational proof-of-concept is exemplified in a patient with PDAC receiving palliative chemotherapy.

Therefore, our fast and cost-efficient assay is a reasonable approach in a predictive clinical setting."

Extensive proteomic and kinomic analysis of these preclinical models are missing and may inform about their functional status, in terms of phosphopeptides and hyperactive signalling pathways. METHODS: We investigated tumour xenografts derived from patients with NSCLC to identify hyperactive signalling pathways. Fresh tumour fragments from 81 NSCLC surgical samples were implanted in Nod/Scid/Gamma mice, and engrafted tumours were compared with primary specimens by morphology, immunohistochemistry, gene mutation\u00a0analyses, and kinase activity profiling. Four different tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors were tested against primary tumour and PDTX lysates using the PamGene peptide microarray platform. RESULTS: The engraftment rate was 33%, with successful engraftment being more associated with poor clinical outcomes. Genomic profiles led to the recognition of hotspot mutations, some of which were initially undetected in donor samples. Kinomic analyses showed that characteristics of primary tumours were retained in PDTXs, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) responses of individual PDTX lines were either expected, based on the genetic status, or alternatively defined suitable targets unpredictable by single-genome fingerprints. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, PDTXs mostly resembled their parental NSCLC. Combining genomic and kinomic analyses of tumour xenografts derived from patients with NSCLC, we identified patients' specific targetable pathways, confirming PDTXs as a preclinical tool for biomarker\u00a0identification and therapeutic algorithm'' improvement."

Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane S\u00a0glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD 'down', one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4+ and IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cell responses. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2-18.2\u00d7 that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera. The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase\u00a0I trials in Germany and the USA1-3, and BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global phase\u00a0II/III trial (NCT04380701 and NCT04368728)."

                "abstract": "The reoccurrence of successive waves of SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests the exploration of more vaccine alternatives is imperative. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a virus vector exhibiting excellent safety as well as efficacy for vaccine development. Here, a series of recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) expressing monomerized or trimerized S proteins from different SARS-CoV-2 variants are engineered. Trimerized S expressed from rMVAs is found predominantly as trimers on the surface of infected cells. Remarkably, immunization of mice with rMVAs demonstrates that S expressed in trimer elicits higher levels of binding IgG and IgA, as well as neutralizing antibodies for matched and mismatched S proteins than S in the monomer. In addition, trimerized S expressed by rMVA induces enhanced cytotoxic T-cell responses than S in the monomer. Importantly, the rMVA vaccines expressing trimerized S exhibit superior protection against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge as the immunized animals all survive without displaying any pathological conditions. This study suggests that opting for trimerized S may represent a more effective approach and highlights that the MVA platform serves as an ideal foundation to continuously advance SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. IMPORTANCE: MVA is a promising vaccine vector and has been approved as a vaccine for smallpox and mpox. Our analyses suggested that recombinant MVA expressing S in trimer (rMVA-ST) elicited robust cellular and humoral immunity and was more effective than MVA-S-monomer. Importantly, the rMVA-ST vaccine was able to stimulate decent cross-reactive neutralization against pseudoviruses packaged using S from different sublineages, including Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron. Remarkably, mice immunized with rMVA-ST were completely protected from a lethal challenge of SARS-CoV-2 without displaying any pathological conditions. Our results demonstrated that an MVA vectored vaccine expressing trimerized S is a promising vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 and the strategy might be adapted for future vaccine development for coronaviruses."

                "abstract": "Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncontrolled in many parts of the world; control is compounded in some areas by the higher transmission potential of the B.1.1.7 variant1, which has now been reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether the response of the virus to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the prototypic strain will be affected by the mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assess the immune responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Decreased neutralization of the B.1.1.7 variant was also observed for monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10) and the receptor-binding motif (5 out of 31), but not for monoclonal antibodies that recognize the receptor-binding domain that bind outside the receptor-binding motif. Introduction of the mutation that encodes the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emerged variant of concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more-substantial loss of neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (19 out of 31) compared with the loss of neutralizing activity conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. The emergence of the E484K substitution in a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine."

Improvements in broadening the vaccine response can stifle new and nascent infections. In this study, we tested the effects of different adjuvant combinations on the immunization of mice with the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing the S1-subunit of the spike protein (S1 protein) from SARS-CoV-2 to induce a robust humoral and cellular immune response. We showed that subcutaneous immunization of S1 protein co-delivered with IL-15 and TLR-ligands (MALP-2, poly I: C, and CpG) or with IL-12 and GM-CSF in DOTAP, or Alum induced significantly high titers of durable antibodies, predominantly IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, that could bind to RBD, S1-subunit, and the full-length ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in sera compared to the immunization with S1 protein alone in both B6 wild-type (WT) and the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. In addition, immunization with S1 protein co-delivered with IL-15 and TLR-ligands induced antibody responses against S1 protein in aged mice, and sera from younger mice reduced plaque formation of live SARS-CoV-2, and had effective binding to S1 protein from ten different variants of SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron (B.1.1.529), and greater neutralization activity as early as day 21 post-immunization measured by inhibition of RBD binding to hACE2 than sera from mice immunized with S1 protein alone or co-delivered with Alum. We also identified antibody-binding epitopes using 18-mer peptides with 9-residue overlaps from the S1 protein. CD8+ T-cell responses specific to RBD and S1 protein peptide pools were observed up to day 200 post-immunization by tetramer staining. These data show the efficacy of specific immunologically targeted adjuvants for increasing S1 protein immunogenicity in mice and can contribute to more effective vaccines."

Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of the SpiN-Tec vaccine, based on a chimeric recombinant protein (SpiN) adjuvanted with CTVad1 (MF59-based adjuvant), aiming at boosting immunity against variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2. Immunization of K18-hACE-2 transgenic mice and hamsters induced high antibody titers and cellular immune response to the SpiN protein as well as to its components, RBD and N proteins. Importantly in a heterologous prime/boost protocol with a COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use (ChAdOx1), SpiN-Tec enhanced the level of circulation neutralizing antibodies (nAb). In addition to protection against the Wuhan isolate, protection against the Delta and Omicron variants was also observed as shown by reduced viral load and lung pathology.

Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomains with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titre at two weeks post-immunization. This is significantly higher than titre caused by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by a spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results showed that vaccination protects hamsters against the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage for protected animals, compared with \u223c10% weight loss, high viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data showed that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37\u00b0C for at least 4 weeks. These findings, along with a history of safety for protein vaccines, suggest that the REVC-128 is a safe, stable and efficacious single-shot vaccine to give the earliest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Numerous COVID-19 vaccines based on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been developed, utilizing various protein expression platforms and adjuvant systems. In a previous study, we reported using the direct fusion of the A subunit of type IIb E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (RBD-LTA) as an intranasal vaccine candidate (Hsieh et al., 2023). In this study, we investigated the effects of an intranasal booster of RBD-LTA/RBD mixture proteins after one or two doses of intramuscular bivalent BA.4/5 mRNA vaccination over 17 and 35\u00a0weeks. Our results indicate that the intranasal RBD-LTA/RBD mixture proteins booster maintains high levels of anti-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies, comparable to those elicited by a two-dose mRNA vaccination regimen. An additional RBD-LTA/RBD mixture proteins booster significantly increased antibody titers, demonstrating the potential of this approach for long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that combining primary mRNA vaccination with an intranasal RBD-LTA/RBD mixture proteins booster can effectively sustain antibody levels over extended periods, providing a promising strategy for long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Dozens of vaccines have been approved or authorized internationally in response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, covering a range of modalities and routes of delivery. For example, mucosal delivery of vaccines via the intranasal (i.n.) route has been shown to improve protective mucosal responses in comparison to intramuscular (i.m.) delivery. As we gain knowledge of the limitations of existing vaccines, it is of interest to understand if changes in product presentation or combinations of multiple vaccine modalities can further improve immunological outcomes. Methods: We investigated a commercial-stage SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen adjuvanted with a clinical-stage TLR-7/8 agonist (3M-052) formulated on aluminum oxyhydroxide (Alum). In a murine immunogenicity model, we compared i.n. and i.m. dosing of the RBD-3M-052-Alum vaccine. We measured the magnitude of antibody responses in serum and lungs, the antibody-secreting cell populations in bone marrow, and antigen-specific cytokine-secreting splenocyte populations. Similarly, we compared different heterologous and homologous prime-boost regimens using the RBD-3M-052-Alum vaccine and a clinical-stage self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine formulated on a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) using the i.m. route alone. Finally, we developed a lyophilized presentation of the RBD-3M-052-Alum vaccine and compared it to the liquid presentation and a heterologous regimen including a previously characterized lyophilized form of the saRNA-NLC vaccine. Results and discussion: We demonstrate that i.n. dosing of the RBD-3M-052-Alum vaccine increased IgA titers in the lung by more than 1.5 logs, but induced serum IgG titers 0.8 logs lower, in comparison to i.m. dosing of the same vaccine. We also show that the homologous prime-boost RBD-3M-052-Alum regimen led to the highest serum IgG and bronchial IgA titers, whereas the homologous saRNA-NLC regimen led to the highest splenocyte interferon-\u03b3 response. We found that priming with the saRNA-NLC vaccine and boosting with the RBD-3M-052-Alum vaccine led to the most desirable immune outcome of all regimens tested. Finally, we show that the lyophilized RBD-3M-052-Alum vaccine retained its immunological characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the route of delivery and the use of heterologous regimens each separately impacts the resulting immune profile, and confirm that multi-product vaccine regimens can be developed with stabilized presentations in mind."

                "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) differentially trigger neutralizing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) antibodies with variable cross-reactivity. Omicron BA.4/5 was approved for inclusion in bivalent vaccination boosters, and therefore the antigenic profile of antibodies elicited by this variant is critical to understand. Here, we investigate the ability of BA.4/5-elicited antibodies following the first documented (primary) infection (n = 13) or breakthrough infection after vaccination (n = 9) to mediate neutralization and Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including XBB.1.5 and BQ.1. Using a pseudovirus neutralization assay and a Fc\u03b3RIIIa crosslinking assay to measure ADCC potential, we show that unlike SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5 infection triggers highly cross-reactive functional antibodies. Cross-reactivity was observed both in the absence of prior vaccination and in breakthrough infections following vaccination. However, BQ.1 and XBB.1.5 neutralization and Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling were significantly compromised compared to other VOCs, regardless of prior vaccination status. BA.4/5 triggered Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling was significantly more resilient against VOCs (<10-fold decrease in magnitude) compared to neutralization (10- to 100-fold decrease). Overall, this study shows that BA.4/5 triggered antibodies are highly cross-reactive compared to those triggered by other variants. Although this is consistent with enhanced neutralization and Fc\u03b3RIIIa signaling breadth of BA.4/5 vaccine boosters, the reduced activity against XBB.1.5 supports the need to update vaccines with XBB sublineage immunogens to provide adequate coverage of these highly antibody evasive variants. IMPORTANCE: The continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a number of variants of concern. Of these, the Omicron sublineage is the most immune evasive. Within Omicron, the BA.4/5 sublineage drove the fifth wave of infection in South Africa prior to becoming the dominant variant globally. As a result this spike sequence was approved as part of a bivalent vaccine booster, and rolled out worldwide. We aimed to understand the cross-reactivity of neutralizing and Fc mediated cytotoxic functions elicited by BA.4/5 infection following infection or breakthrough infection. We find that, in contrast to BA.1 which triggered fairly strain-specific antibodies, BA.4/5 triggered antibodies that are highly cross-reactive for neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity potential. Despite this cross-reactivity, these antibodies are compromised against highly resistant variants such as XBB.1.5 and BQ.1. This suggests that next-generation vaccines will require XBB sublineage immunogens in order to protect against these evasive variants."

The effects of immune imprinting on serum antibody responses after boosting with variant-matched SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remain uncertain. Here we characterized the serum antibody responses after mRNA vaccine boosting of mice and human clinical trial participants. In mice, a single dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike protein minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling generation of type-specific antibodies. However, imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron vaccine. In both SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected humans who received two Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because serum neutralizing responses against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses were abrogated after pre-clearing with Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes targeted by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Thus, the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is imprinted by immunizations with historical mRNA-1273 vaccines, but this outcome may be beneficial as it drives expansion of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and distantly related sarbecoviruses."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In order to prevent the emergence and spread of future variants of concern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), developing vaccines capable of stopping transmission is crucial. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine NDV-HXP-S can be administered live intranasally (IN) and thus induce protective immunity in the upper respiratory tract. The vaccine is based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing a stabilised SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. NDV-HXP-S can be produced as influenza virus vaccine at low cost in embryonated chicken eggs. METHODS: The NDV-HXP-S vaccine was genetically engineered to match the Omicron variants of concern (VOC) BA.1 and BA.5 and tested as an IN two or three dose vaccination regimen in female mice. Furthermore, female mice intramuscularly (IM) vaccinated with mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were IN boosted with NDV-HXP-S. Systemic humoral immunity, memory T cell responses in the lungs and spleens as well as immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses in distinct mucosal tissues were characterised. FINDINGS: NDV-HXP-S Omicron variant vaccines elicited high mucosal IgA and serum IgG titers against respective SARS-CoV-2 VOC in female mice following IN administration and protected against challenge from matched variants. Additionally, antigen-specific memory B cells and local T cell responses in the lungs were induced. Host immunity against the NDV vector did not interfere with boosting. Intramuscular vaccination with mRNA-LNPs was enhanced by IN NDV-HXP-S boosting resulting in improvement of serum neutralization titers and induction of mucosal immunity. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that NDV-HXP-S Omicron variant vaccines utilised for primary immunizations or boosting efficiently elicit humoral and cellular immunity. The described induction of systemic and mucosal immunity has the potential to reduce infection and transmission. FUNDING: This work was partially funded by the NIAIDCenters of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) and by the NIAID Collaborative Vaccine Innovation Centers and by institutional funding from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Subunit protein vaccines are manufactured at large scales at low costs, have less stringent temperature requirements for distribution in LMICs, and several candidates have shown protection against SARS-CoV-2. We previously reported an engineered variant of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain antigen (RBD-L452K-F490W; RBD-J) with enhanced manufacturability and immunogenicity compared to the ancestral RBD. Here, we report a second-generation engineered RBD antigen (RBD-J6) with two additional mutations to a hydrophobic cryptic epitope in the RBD core, S383D and L518D, that further improved expression titers and biophysical stability. RBD-J6 retained binding affinity to human convalescent sera and to all tested neutralizing antibodies except antibodies that target the class IV epitope on the RBD core. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice immunized with three doses of a Beta variant of RBD-J6 displayed on a virus-like particle (VLP) generated neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to nine SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern at similar levels as two doses of Comirnaty. The vaccinated mice were also protected from challenge with Alpha or Beta SARS-CoV-2. This engineered antigen could be useful for modular RBD-based subunit vaccines to enhance manufacturability and global access, or for further development of variant-specific or broadly acting booster vaccines."

                "abstract": "The goal of the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine is to provide rapid respiratory tract protection with a single dose. Circulating antibodies do not protect the olfactory mucosa from viral infection, necessitating localized mucosal immunization. Live attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVMT)-based COVID-19 vaccines effectively stimulate mucosal immunity in animals, though safety concerns remain, particularly in immunocompromised populations. A viral vector capable of single-cycle replication may face less stringent regulatory requirements. A replication-defective VSVMT is developed with its G protein replaced by a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) mutant, where residues K986 and V987 are substituted by prolines (S2P). This studies show that single-cycle VSVMT encoding Omicron subvariant S2P (VSVMT-S2P) is safe in both healthy and immunocompromised animals treated with cyclophosphamide (CP). Significant antibody and T-cell responses against the spike protein are observed in VSVMT-S2P vaccinated healthy animals. Intramuscular VSVMT-S2P administration induces neutralizing antibody responses comparable to those from replication-competent VSVMT-S. In immunocompromised animals, lower and delayed immune responses are observed. Thus, single-cycle M-protein mutated VSV offers a safe and effective platform for SARS-CoV-2 immunogen delivery. Remarkably, replication-competent VSVMT-S caused no pathogenicity and elicited potent mucosal immunity via intranasal administration, highlighting its potential as a mucosal COVID-19 vaccine."

These mutations are not evenly distributed on the RBD surface but cluster on several distinct surfaces, suggesting an influence of the targeted epitope on the capacity to neutralize a broad range of VOCs. Here, we identified a potent nAb from convalescent patients targeting the receptor-binding domain of a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Except for the Lambda and BA.2.86 variants, this nAb efficiently inhibited the entry of most tested VOCs, including Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, XBB.1.5, and EG.5.1 and to a limited extent also BA.4/5, BA.4.6, and BQ.1.1. It bound recombinant S protein with picomolar affinity, reduced the viral load in the lung of infected hamsters, and prevented the severe lung pathology typical for SARS-CoV-2 infections. An X-ray structure of the nAb-RBD complex revealed an epitope that does not fall into any of the conventional classes and provided insights into its broad neutralization properties. Our findings highlight a conserved epitope within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that should be preferably targeted by therapeutic antibodies and inform rational vaccine development.IMPORTANCETherapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection and constitute an important option in pandemic preparedness, but mutations within the S protein of virus variants (e.g., a mutation of L452) confer resistance to many of such antibodies. Here, we identify a human antibody targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with an elevated escape barrier and characterize its interaction with the RBD functionally and structurally at the atomic level. A direct comparison with reported antibodies targeting the same epitope illustrates important differences in the interface, providing insights into the breadth of antibody binding. These findings highlight the relevance of an extended neutralization profiling in combination with biochemical and structural characterization of the antibody-RBD interaction for the selection of future therapeutic antibodies, which may accelerate the control of potential future pandemics."

Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern in a cohort of 121 BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCW). Twenty-three HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a second dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants."

                "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, leading to breakthrough infections. The development of new vaccine strategies to combat various strains is crucial. Protein cyclization can enhance thermal stability and may improve immunogenicity. Here, we designed a cyclic tandem dimeric receptor-binding domain protein (cirRBD2) via the split intein Cth-Ter. Cyclization does not affect the antigen epitopes of RBD but results in better thermal stability than that of its linear counterpart (linRBD2). Compared with the mice\u00a0immunized with linRBD2, those immunized with two doses of 5\u2009\u03bcg of cirRBD2 produced significantly greater levels of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies, and generated a considerable cellular immune response. In the VEEV-VRP-hACE2-transduced mouse model, two doses of 5\u2009\u03bcg of cirRBD2 provided protection against infection with BA.5, XBB.1.9, and partial protection against EG.5 which has more mutations. This study developed a novel circular RBD dimer subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that exhibits broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against various variants. A similar strategy can be applied to develop vaccines for other pathogens, especially for thermally stable vaccines."

                "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants presents challenges to vaccine effectiveness, underlining the necessity for next-generation vaccines with multiple antigens beyond the spike protein. Here, we investigated a multiantigenic booster containing spike and a chimeric construct composed of nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) proteins, comparing its efficacy to a spike-only booster against Omicron BA.5 in K18-hACE2 mice. Initially, mice were primed and boosted with Beta (B.1.351) spike-only mRNA, showing strong spike-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies, albeit with limited cross-neutralization to Omicron variants. Subsequently, a spike-NM multiantigenic vaccine was then examined as a second booster dose for protection in hACE2-transgenic mice. Mice receiving either homologous spike-only or heterologous spike-NM booster had nearly complete inhibition of infectious virus shedding in oral swabs and reduced viral burdens in both lung and nasal tissues following BA.5 challenge. Examination of lung pathology further revealed that both spike-only and spike-NM boosters provided comparable protection against inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis. Moreover, the spike-NM booster demonstrated neutralization efficacy in a pseudovirus assay against Wuhan-Hu-1, Beta, and Omicron variants akin to the spike-only booster. These findings indicate that supplementing spike with additional SARS-CoV-2 targets in a booster immunization confers equivalent immunity and protection against Omicron BA.5. This work highlights a promising strategy for individuals previously vaccinated with spike-only vaccines, potentially offering enhanced protection against emerging coronaviruses."

However, the importance of humoral and cellular immunity for protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Here we show that the adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) protects naive recipient macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent macaques partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against rechallenge with SARS-CoV-2, which suggests a role for cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titres. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titres are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titres are required for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. These findings have implications for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and immune-based therapeutic agents."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Vaccine platforms such as viral vectors and mRNA can accelerate vaccine development in response to newly emerging pathogens, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the differential effects of platform and antigen insert on vaccine immunogenicity remain incompletely understood. Innate immune responses induced by viral vector vaccines are suggested to have an adjuvant effect for subsequent adaptive immunity. Integrating data on both innate and adaptive immunity, systems vaccinology approaches can improve the understanding of vaccine-induced immune mechanisms. Methods: Two vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, both based on the viral vector Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and encoding the native (MVA-SARS-2-S) or prefusion-stabilized spike protein (MVA-SARS-2-ST), were evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04569383, NCT04895449). Longitudinal dynamics of innate and early adaptive immune responses induced by vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve individuals were analyzed based on transcriptome and flow cytometry data, in comparison to the licensed ChAd and mRNA vaccines. Results: Compared to MVA-SARS-2-S, MVA-SARS-2-ST (encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein) induced a stronger transcriptional activation early after vaccination, as well as higher virus neutralizing antibodies. Positive correlations were observed between innate and adaptive immune responses induced by a second MVA-SARS-2-ST vaccination. MVA-, ChAd- and mRNA-based vaccines induced distinct immune signatures, with the overall strongest transcriptional activation as well as monocyte and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cell responses induced by ChAd. Discussion: Our findings suggest a potential impact of the spike protein conformation not only on adaptive but also on innate immune responses. As indicated by positive correlations between several immune parameters induced by MVA-SARS-2-ST, the distinct transcriptional activation early after vaccination may be linked to the induction of classical monocytes and activation of cTFH1 cells, which may in turn result in the superior adaptive immunogenicity of MVA-SARS-2-ST, compared to MVA-SARS-2-S. Overall, our data demonstrate that both the vaccine platform and antigen insert can affect innate immune responses and subsequent vaccine immunogenicity in humans."

                "abstract": "Vaccines are proving to be highly effective in controlling hospitalisation and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection but the emergence of viral variants with novel antigenic profiles threatens to diminish their efficacy. Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here, we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals, the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351 (South African) variant (6.29-fold reduction) that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2, conferred reductions in titre of 7.77, 11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses, the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69, 4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs, and others, demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly, booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity."

                "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis and characterization of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection model that mimics non-severe and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans is warranted for understating the virus and developing preventive and therapeutic agents. Here, we characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in the epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2 infections typically start. We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lung, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009101 and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered from infection with a low dose of virus survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans being dose-dependent and can provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached nearly 240 million cases, caused nearly 5 million deaths worldwide as of October 2021, and has raised an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To achieve this goal, an animal model that recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenesis and survival in response to different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that this model could be a useful tool for the development of antiviral drugs and therapeutics."

                "abstract": "The rapid emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global health emergency. While most human disease is mild to moderate, some infections lead to a severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, anosmia, ageusia, and, in some instances, neurological involvement. Small-animal models reproducing severe disease, including neurological sequela, are needed to characterize the pathophysiological mechanism(s) of disease and to identify medical countermeasures. Transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the K18 promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge when high viral doses are used. Here, we report on SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters engineered to express the hACE2 receptor under the control of the K18 promoter. K18-hACE2 hamsters infected with a relatively low dose of 100 or 1,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 developed a severe and lethal disease, with most animals succumbing by day 5 postinfection. Hamsters developed severe lesions and inflammation within the upper and lower respiratory system, including infection of the nasal cavities causing marked destruction of the olfactory epithelium as well as severe bronchopneumonia that extended deep into the alveoli. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection spread to the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain stem and spinal cord. Wild-type (WT) hamsters naturally support SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the primary lesions present in the respiratory tract and nasal cavity. Overall, infection in the K18-hACE2 hamsters is more extensive than that in WT hamsters, with more CNS involvement and a lethal outcome. These findings demonstrate the K18-hACE2 hamster model will be valuable for studying SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has created a global health emergency. While most human SARS-CoV-2 disease is mild, some people develop severe, life-threatening disease. Small-animal models mimicking the severe aspects of human disease are needed to more clearly understand the pathophysiological processes driving this progression. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters engineered to express the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 viral receptor under the control of the K18 promoter. SARS-CoV-2 produces a severe and lethal infection in transgenic hamsters that mirrors the most severe aspects of COVID-19 in humans, including respiratory and neurological injury. In contrast to other animal systems, hamsters manifest disease with levels of input virus more consistent with natural human infection. This system will be useful for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease and the development of drugs targeting this virus."

The urgent need to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and enable continued development of effective countermeasures is aided by the production of laboratory tools that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research. We previously created a directly accessible SARS-CoV-2 toolkit containing user-friendly reverse genetic (RG) infectious clones of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using K18-human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, we confirmed the validity of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses to reproduce the infection profile, clinical disease, and pathogenesis already established in mice infected with natural SARS-CoV-2 isolates, often patient derived. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice developed substantial clinical disease and weight loss by day 6 postinfection. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from the lungs and brains of infected K18-hACE2 mice, and infection resulted in viral pneumonia with considerable changes in lung pathology, as seen previously with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In mice infected with RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-mCherry, mCherry was detected in areas of lung consolidation and colocalized with clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2-assocated immunopathology. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses successfully recapitulated many of the features of severe COVID-19 associated with the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With utility in vivo, the RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be valuable resources to advance numerous areas of SARS-CoV-2 basic research and COVID-19 vaccine development.IMPORTANCE To develop COVID-19 countermeasures, powerful research tools are essential. We produced a SARS-COV-2 reverse genetic (RG) infectious clone toolkit that will benefit a variety of investigations. In this study, we further prove the toolkit's value by demonstrating the in vivo utility of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates reproduce disease signs and pathology characteristic of the K18-hACE2 mouse model of severe COVID-19 in infected mice. Having been validated as a model of severe COVID-19 previously using only natural SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients, this is the first investigation of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses in K18-hACE2 mice. The RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will facilitate basic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the preclinical development of COVID-19 therapeutics."

Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge.

Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice.

SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants have been reported to circulate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 symptoms include respiratory symptoms, fever, muscle pain, and breathing difficulty. In addition, up to 30% of COVID-19 patients experience neurological complications such as headaches, nausea, stroke, and anosmia. However, the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. This study investigated the neurotropic patterns between the B1.617.2 (Delta) and Hu-1 variants (Wuhan, early strain) in K18-hACE2 mice. Despite both the variants inducing similar pathogenic patterns in various organs, B1.617.2-infected K18-hACE2 mice demonstrated a higher range of disease phenotypes such as weight loss, lethality, and conjunctivitis when compared to those in Hu-1-infected mice. In addition, histopathological analysis revealed that B1.617.2 infects the brain of K18-hACE2 mice more rapidly and effectively than Hu-1. Finally, we discovered that, in B1.617.2-infected mice, the early activation of various signature genes involved innate cytokines and that the necrosis-related response was most pronounced than that in Hu-1-infected mice.

Thus far, most investigators have used transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 in epithelial cells (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice) that are intranasally instilled with a liquid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suspension under deep anesthesia. Unfortunately, this experimental approach results in disproportionate high central nervous system infection leading to fatal encephalitis, which is rarely observed in humans and severely limits this model\u2019s usefulness. Here, we describe the use of an inhalation tower system that allows exposure of unanesthetized mice to aerosolized virus under controlled conditions. Aerosol exposure of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice to SARS-CoV-2 resulted in robust viral replication in the respiratory tract, anosmia, and airway obstruction but did not lead to fatal viral neuroinvasion. When compared with intranasal inoculation, aerosol infection resulted in a more pronounced lung pathology including increased immune infiltration, fibrin deposition, and a transcriptional signature comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected patients.

An animal model is a valuable and a crucial tool that allows understanding of nature in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated COVID-19 disease. Here we introduce detailed protocols of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease using C57BL/6 (B6) transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) from the human cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18 hACE2). To mimic natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, K18 hACE2 transgenic mice are infected intranasally under anesthesia. Upon infection, viral pathogenesis is determined by monitoring changes in body weight (morbidity) and monitoring survival (mortality), cytokine/chemokine responses, gross-lung pathology, histopathology, and viral replication in tissues. The presence of the virus and viral replication is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and viral titrations, respectively, from the upper (nasal turbinate) and the lower (lungs) respiratory tracts, and nervous system (brain). Also, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is measured by cytokine/chemokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from lung, spleen and brain homogenates to characterize the cytokine storm that hallmarks as one of the major causes of death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This small rodent animal model based on the use of K18 hACE2 transgenic mice represents an excellent option to understand the pathogenicity of natural SARS-CoV-2 strains and its recently described Variants of Concern (VoC), and will be applicable to the identification and characterization of prophylactic (vaccine) and therapeutic (antiviral and/or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies) strategies for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection or its associated COVID-19 disease."

                "abstract": "The development of mouse models for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has enabled testing of vaccines and therapeutics and defining aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 disease is severe in K18 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2 Tg) expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, under an ectopic cytokeratin promoter, with high levels of infection measured in the lung and brain. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 knock-in (KI) mice that express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2 (mACE2). Intranasal inoculation of hACE2 KI mice with SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 resulted in substantial viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts with limited spread to extrapulmonary organs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 KI mice did not lose weight and developed limited pathology. Moreover, no significant differences in viral burden were observed in hACE2 KI mice infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 variants compared to the WA1/2020 strain. Because the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in mice remain uncertain, we evaluated the impact of the naturally occurring, mouse-adapting N501Y mutation by comparing infection of hACE2 KI, K18-hACE2 Tg, ACE2-deficient, and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The N501Y mutation minimally affected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 KI mice but was required for viral replication in wild-type C57BL/6 mice in a mACE2-dependent manner and augmented pathogenesis in the K18-hACE2 Tg mice. Thus, the N501Y mutation likely enhances interactions with mACE2 or hACE2 in vivo. Overall, our study highlights the hACE2 KI mice as a model of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease and clarifies the requirement of the N501Y mutation in mice. IMPORTANCE Mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis have facilitated the rapid evaluation of countermeasures. While the first generation of models developed pneumonia and severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, they relied on ectopic expression of supraphysiological levels of human ACE2 (hACE2). This has raised issues with their relevance to humans, as the hACE2 receptor shows a more restricted expression pattern in the respiratory tract. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease with viruses containing or lacking a key mouse-adapting mutation in the spike gene in hACE2 KI mice, which express hACE2 under an endogenous promoter in place of murine ACE2. While infection of hACE2 KI mice with multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern resulted in viral replication within the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the animals did not sustain severe lung injury. Thus, hACE2 KI mice serve as a model of mild infection with both ancestral and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains."

                "abstract": "The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has made millions ill with COVID-19 and even more from the economic fallout of this pandemic. Our quest to test new therapeutics and vaccines require small animal models that replicate disease phenotypes seen in COVID-19 cases. Rodent models of SARS-CoV-2 infection thus far have shown mild to moderate pulmonary disease; mortality, if any, has been associated with prominent signs of central nervous system (CNS) infection and dysfunction. Here we describe the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 variants with propensity for either pulmonary or CNS infection. Using a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a COVID-19 patient, we first found that infection was lethal in transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Fortuitously, full genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the brain and lung of these animals showed genetic differences. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 isolates from brains and lungs of these also showed differences in plaque morphology. Inoculation of these brain and lung SARS-CoV-2 isolates into new batch of hACE2 mice intra-nasally resulted in lethal CNS and pulmonary infection, respectively. Collectively, our study suggests that genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 could be used to replicate specific features of COVID-19 for the testing of potential vaccines or therapeutics."

                "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic that might lead to very serious consequences. Notably, mental status change, brain confusion, and smell and taste disorders along with neurological complaints have been reported in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, human brain tissue autopsies from COVID-19 patients show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, which correlates with the manifestation of meningitis, encephalitis, leukocyte infiltration, and neuronal damage. The olfactory mucosa has been suggested as a way of entry into the brain. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also known to provoke a hyper-inflammatory reaction with an exponential increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to systemic responses, even in the absence of direct infection of brain cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been extensively demonstrated to be present in the periphery, neurons, and glial cells in different brain regions. To dissect the details of neurological complications and develop therapies helping COVID-19 survivors regain pre-infection quality of life, the development of robust clinical models is highly warranted. Several human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse models have been developed and used for antiviral drug screening and vaccine development, as well as for better understanding of the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we summarize recent results from the studies involving two such mouse models, namely K18- and CAG-hACE2 transgenics, to evaluate the direct and indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the central nervous system."

                "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes severe viral pneumonia and is associated with a high fatality rate. A substantial proportion of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 suffer from mild hyposmia to complete loss of olfactory function, resulting in anosmia. However, the pathogenesis of the olfactory dysfunction and comparative pathology of upper respiratory infections with SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. We describe the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization findings from rodent models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The main histopathological findings in the olfactory epithelia of K8-hACE2 Tg mice, hACE2 Tg mice, and hamsters were varying degrees of inflammatory lesions, including disordered arrangement, necrosis, exfoliation, and macrophage infiltration of the olfactory epithelia, and inflammatory exudation. On the basis of these observations, the nasal epithelia of these rodent models appeared to develop moderate, mild, and severe rhinitis, respectively. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and antigen were mainly identified in the olfactory epithelia and lamina propria. Moreover, viral RNA was abundant in the cerebrum of K18-hACE2 Tg mice, including the olfactory bulb. The K8-hACE2 Tg mouse, hACE2 Tg mouse, and hamster models could be used to investigate the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract and central nervous system. These models could help to provide a better understanding of the pathogenic process of this virus and to develop effective medications and prophylactic treatments."

                "title": "Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 Accessory Proteins to Viral Pathogenicity in K18 Human ACE2 Transgenic Mice.",
                "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As of 19 May 2021, John Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking platform reported 3.3 million deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, the World Health Organization has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to six COVID-19 vaccine candidates. However, much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse-genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) constructs; we removed individual viral ORF3a, -6, -7a, -7b, and -8 proteins from them, and we characterized the resulting recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF-deficient (\u0394ORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of \u0394ORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the \u0394ORF rSARS-CoV-2s identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while \u0394ORF7a, \u0394ORF7b, and \u0394ORF8 rSARS-CoV-2s induced pathology comparable to that of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse-genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 constructs and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Despite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remain elusive. Our study aims (i) to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins to viral pathogenesis and disease outcome and (ii) to develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse-genetics system to generate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 constructs with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as a foundation for generating attenuated forms of the virus to develop live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2."

Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed on day 3 and declined on days 5 and 6 after infection. By contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals on days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice."

                "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are impacting responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we utilized passive immunization using human convalescent plasma (HCP) obtained from a critically ill COVID-19 patient in the early pandemic to study the efficacy of polyclonal antibodies generated to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 against the Alpha, Beta, and Delta VoC in the K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse model. HCP protected mice from challenge with the original WA-1 SARS-CoV-2 strain; however, only partially protected mice challenged with the Alpha VoC (60% survival) and failed to save Beta challenged mice from succumbing to disease. HCP treatment groups had elevated receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid IgG titers in the serum; however, Beta VoC viral RNA burden in the lung and brain was not decreased due to HCP treatment. While mice could be protected from WA-1 or Alpha challenge with a single dose of HCP, six doses of HCP could not decrease mortality of Delta challenged mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that VoC have enhanced immune evasion and this work underscores the need for in vivo models to evaluate future emerging strains. IMPORTANCE Emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC are posing new problems regarding vaccine and monoclonal antibody efficacy. To better understand immune evasion tactics of the VoC, we utilized passive immunization to study the effect of early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 HCP against, Alpha, Beta, and Delta VoC. We observed that HCP from a human infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 was unable to control lethality of Alpha, Beta, or Delta VoC in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate that passive immunization can be used as a model to evaluate immune evasion of emerging VoC strains."

To explore this, an experimental study was carried out in BCG-stimulated and non-stimulated k18-hACE2 mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Viral loads in tissues determined by RT-qPCR, histopathology in brain and lungs, immunohistochemical study in brain (IHC) as well as mortality rates, clinical signs and plasma inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers were assessed. Our results showed BCG-SARS-CoV-2 challenged mice presented higher viral loads in the brain and an increased frequency of neuroinvasion, with the greatest differences observed between groups at 3-4\u00a0days post-infection (dpi). Histopathological examination showed a higher severity of brain lesions in BCG-SARS-CoV-2 challenged mice, mainly consisting of neuroinflammation, increased glial cell population and neuronal degeneration, from 5 dpi onwards. This group also presented higher interstitial pneumonia and vascular thrombosis in lungs (3-4 dpi), BCG-SARS-CoV-2 mice showed higher values for TNF-\u03b1 and D-dimer values, while iNOS values were higher in SARS-CoV-2 mice at 3-4 dpi. Results presented in this study indicate that BCG stimulation could have intensified the inflammatory and neurodegenerative lesions promoting virus neuroinvasion and dissemination in this experimental model. Although k18-hACE2 mice show higher hACE2 expression and neurodissemination, this study suggests that, although the benefits of BCG on enhancing heterologous protection against pathogens and tumour cells have been broadly demonstrated, potential adverse outcomes due to the non-specific effects of BCG should be considered."

Diverse preclinical studies using K18-hACE2 mice and Syrian golden hamsters, which are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract, are emerging; however, the systemic pathogenesis and cellular tropism of these models remain obscure. We intranasally infected K18-hACE2 mice and Syrian golden hamsters with SARS-CoV-2, and compared the clinical features, pathogenesis, cellular tropism and infiltrated immune-cell subsets. In K18-hACE2 mice, SARS-CoV-2 persistently replicated in alveolar cells and caused pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, resulting in fatal outcomes. Conversely, in Syrian golden hamsters, transient SARS-CoV-2 infection in bronchial cells caused reversible pulmonary disease, without mortality.

The innate immunity of the infected patient is unable to mount an effective defense, resulting in a severe illness with substantial morbidity and mortality. As most treatment modalities including antivirals and anti-inflammatory agents are mostly ineffective, an immunological approach is needed. The mechanism of innate immunity to this viral illness is not fully understood. Passive immunity becomes an important avenue for the management of these patients. In this article, the immune responses of COVID-19 patients are reviewed. As SARS-CoV-2 has many characteristics in common with two other viruses, SARS-CoV that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the experiences learned from the use of passive immunity in treatment can be applied to COVID-19. The immune response includes the appearance of immunoglobulin M followed by immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies. Convalescent plasma obtained from patients recovered from the illness with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was successful in treating many COVID-19 patients. The factors that determine responses as compared with those seen in SARS and MERS are also reviewed. As there are no approved vaccines against all three viruses, it remains a challenge in the ongoing development for an effective vaccine for COVID-19."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to approximately 500 million cases and 6 million deaths worldwide. Previous investigations into the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 primarily focused on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients, lacking detailed mechanistic insights into the virus's impact on inflamed tissue. Existing animal models, such as hamster and ferret, do not faithfully replicate the severe SARS-CoV-2 infection seen in patients, underscoring the need for more relevant animal system-based research. METHODS: In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with lung tissues from K18-hACE2 transgenic (TG) mice during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach allowed for a comprehensive examination of the molecular and cellular responses to the virus in lung tissue. FINDINGS: Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, K18-hACE2 TG mice exhibited severe lung pathologies, including acute pneumonia, alveolar collapse, and immune cell infiltration. Through scRNA-seq, we identified 36 different types of cells dynamically orchestrating SARS-CoV-2-induced pathologies. Notably, SPP1+ macrophages in the myeloid compartment emerged as key drivers of severe lung inflammation and fibrosis in K18-hACE2 TG mice. Dynamic receptor-ligand interactions, involving various cell types such as immunological and bronchial cells, defined an enhanced TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway linked to delayed tissue regeneration, severe lung injury, and fibrotic processes. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in lung tissue, surpassing previous limitations in investigating inflamed tissues. The identified SPP1+ macrophages and the dysregulated TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Insights from this research may contribute to the development of innovative diagnostics and therapies for COVID-19.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurological damage caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted increasing attention. Recently, through autopsies of patients with COVID-19, the direct identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in their central nervous system (CNS) has been reported, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might directly attack the CNS. The need to prevent COVID-19-induced severe injuries and potential sequelae is urgent, requiring the elucidation of large-scale molecular mechanisms in\u00a0vivo. METHODS: In this study, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, lungs, and kidneys of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 female mice. We then performed comprehensive bioinformatic analyses, including differential analyses, functional enrichment, and kinase prediction, to identify key molecules involved in COVID-19. FINDINGS: We found that the cortex had higher viral loads than did the lungs, and the kidneys did not have SARS-COV-2. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, RIG-I-associated virus recognition, antigen processing and presentation, and complement and coagulation cascades were activated to different degrees in all five organs, especially the lungs. The infected cortex exhibited disorders of multiple organelles and biological processes, including dysregulated spliceosome, ribosome, peroxisome, proteasome, endosome, and mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain. The hippocampus and thalamus had fewer disorders than did the cortex; however, hyperphosphorylation of Mapt/Tau, which may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, was found in all three brain regions. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-induced elevation of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was observed in the lungs and kidneys, but not in the three brain regions. Although the virus was not detected, the kidneys expressed high levels of hACE2 and exhibited obvious functional dysregulation after infection. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can cause tissue infections or damage via complicated routes. Thus, the treatment of COVID-19 requires a multipronged approach. INTERPRETATION: This study provides observations and in\u00a0vivo datasets for COVID-19-associated proteomic and phosphoproteomic alterations in multiple organs, especially cerebral tissues, of K18-hACE2 mice. In mature drug databases, the differentially expressed proteins and predicted kinases in this study can be used as baits to identify candidate therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. This study can serve as a solid resource for the scientific community. The data in this manuscript will serve as a starting point for future research on COVID-19-associated encephalopathy.

Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to profile chromatin state transitions in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We identify an epigenomic continuum representing loss of cellular identity and progression toward a metastatic state. We define co-accessible regulatory programs and infer key activating and repressive chromatin regulators of these cell states. Among these co-accessibility programs, we identify a pre-metastatic transition, characterized by activation of RUNX transcription factors, which mediates extracellular matrix remodeling to promote metastasis and is predictive of survival across human LUAD patients. Together, these results demonstrate the power of single-cell epigenomics to identify regulatory programs to uncover mechanisms and key biomarkers of tumor progression."

Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and RAS, signaling through SMAD and RAS-responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB1), jointly trigger expression of EMT and fibrogenic factors as two discrete arms of a common transcriptional response in carcinoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that both arms come together to form a program for lung adenocarcinoma metastasis and identify chromatin determinants tying the expression of the constituent genes to TGF-\u03b2 and RAS inputs. RREB1 localizes to H4K16acK20ac marks in histone H2A.Z-loaded nucleosomes at enhancers in the fibrogenic genes interleukin-11 (IL11), platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), as well as the EMT transcription factor SNAI1, priming these enhancers for activation by a SMAD4-INO80 nucleosome remodeling complex in response to TGF-\u03b2. These regulatory properties segregate the fibrogenic EMT program from RAS-independent TGF-\u03b2 gene responses and illuminate the operation and vulnerabilities of a bifunctional program that promotes metastatic outgrowth."

Loss of the pulmonary lineage specifier NKX2-1 in KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) enhances tumor progression and causes a FoxA1/2-dependent pulmonary-to-gastric lineage switch. However, the mechanisms by which FoxA1/2 activate a latent gastric identity in the lung remain largely unknown. Here, we show that FoxA1/2 reprogram the epigenetic landscape of gastric-specific genes after NKX2-1 loss in mouse models by facilitating ten-eleven translocation (TET)2/3 recruitment, DNA demethylation, histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) deposition, and three-dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions. FoxA1/2-mediated DNA methylation changes are highly conserved in human endodermal development and in progression of human lung and pancreatic neoplasia. Furthermore, oncogenic signaling is required for specific elements of FoxA1/2-dependent epigenetic reprogramming. This work demonstrates the role of FoxA1/2 in rewiring the DNA methylation and 3D chromatin landscape of NKX2-1-negative LUAD to drive cancer cell lineage switching."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrence and metastasis remain significant challenges in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) after radical resection. The mechanisms behind the recurrence and metastasis of LUAD remain elusive, and deregulated cellular metabolism is suspected to play a significant role. This study explores the metabolic and epigenetic regulation mediated by nicotinamide N-methyl transferase (NNMT) in LUAD. METHODS: Untargeted metabolomic analyses were performed to detect metabolism irregularities. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) databases and multiplex immunofluorescence analysis were used to identify the location of NNMT within the tumor microenvironment. The biological functions of NNMT were investigated both in vitro and in vivo, with RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR providing insights into underlying mechanisms. Finally, single-cell RNA-seq data and immunohistochemistry of primary tumors were analyzed to validate the main findings. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomic analyses revealed metabolic aberrations in amino acids, organic acids, lipids, and nicotinamide pathways, which are linked to metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer. NNMT is a key enzyme in nicotinamide metabolism, and we found the bulk tissue mRNA level of NNMT gene was inversely associated with LUAD metastasis. NNMT was proved to be predominantly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the stromal regions of LUAD, and a low stromal NNMT expression was identified as a predictor of poor disease-free survival following radical resection of LUAD. The isolation and primary culture of CAFs from LUAD enabled in vitro and in vivo experiments, which confirmed that NNMT negatively regulated the metastasis-promoting properties of CAFs in LUAD. Mechanistically, the downregulation of NNMT led to an increase in intracellular methyl groups by reducing the activity of the methionine cycle, resulting in heightened methylation at H3K4me3. This alteration triggered the upregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling in CAFs, including those encoding collagens, integrins, laminins, and matrix metalloproteinases, thereby facilitating cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Reanalysis of single-cell RNA-seq data and immunohistochemistry assays of primary LUAD tissues substantiated NNMT's negative regulation of these genes in CAFs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into the metabolic and epigenetic regulatory functions of NNMT in CAFs, expanding the current understanding of LUAD metastasis regulation and suggesting potential avenues for future research and therapeutic development."

                "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally, underscoring the urgency for targeted therapeutic strategies. The specific role and impact of the SEC61 translocon gamma subunit (SEC61G) in LUAD progression and metastasis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we use a multifaceted approach, combining bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation, to elucidate the pivotal role of SEC61G and its associated molecular mechanisms in LUAD. Our integrated analyses reveal a significant positive correlation between SEC61G expression and the glycolytic activity of LUAD, as evidenced by increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans. Further investigations show the potential influence of SEC61G on metabolic reprogramming, which contributes to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Remarkably, we identify a negative association between SEC61G expression levels and the infiltration of critical immune cell populations within the TME, along with correlations with immune checkpoint gene expression and tumor heterogeneity scores in LUAD. Functional studies demonstrate that SEC61G knockdown markedly inhibits the migration of A549 and H2030 LUAD cells. This inhibitory effect is accompanied by a significant downregulation of key regulators of tumor progression, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), lactate dehydrogenase A, and genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway. In conclusion, our comprehensive analyses position SEC61G as a potential prognostic biomarker intricately linked to glycolytic metabolism, the EMT pathway, and the establishment of an immune-suppressive phenotype in LUAD. These findings underscore the potential of SEC61G as a therapeutic target and predictive marker for immunotherapeutic responses in LUAD patients."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in contemporary therapeutic approaches have increased the survival rates of lung cancer patients; however, the long-term benefits remain constrained, underscoring the pressing need for novel biomarkers. Surfactant-associated 3 (SFTA3), a long non-coding RNA predominantly expressed in normal lung epithelial cells, plays a crucial role in lung development. Nevertheless, its function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains inadequately understood. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data were utilized to identify novel cancer cell-intrinsic gene signatures associated with the progression of LUAD, and their roles in LUAD were comprehensively analyzed. Serum samples were collected to quantify the expression levels of SFTA3 in LUAD patients. Furthermore, a series of biological experiments, including cell viability assays, scratch wound healing assays, and colony formation assays, were conducted to demonstrate the tumor-suppressive effects of SFTA3. RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SFTA3 in lung cancer cells. RESULTS: We constructed a prognostic model comprising eight genes: ALDOA, ATP5MD, SERPINH1, SFTA3, SLK, U2SURP, SCGB1A1, and SCGB1A3. The model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk categories, revealing that low-risk patients experienced superior clinical outcomes, exhibited an immunologically hot tumor microenvironment (TME), and had a greater probability of responding to immunotherapy. In contrast, the high-risk group exhibited a cold TME and may benefit more from chemotherapy. Furthermore, our study revealed that a progressive decrease in SFTA3 expression in cancer cells was correlated with tumor advancement. Notably, the serum levels of SFTA3 significantly decreased in patients with LUAD, suggesting its potential utility in liquid biopsy for LUAD diagnosis. Additionally, the knockdown of SFTA3 enhances the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells, whereas its overexpression inhibits these phenotypes. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway was significantly enriched following SFTA3 silencing, suggesting that SFTA3 may impact tumor progression by modulating this process. We also identified key transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the downregulation of SFTA3 in LUAD. CONCLUSION: We developed a robust prognostic model and identified SFTA3 as a novel biomarker with potential applications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment of LUAD. Additionally, our findings offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying LUAD tumorigenesis and immune evasion."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful method for identifying the loci and genes that contribute to disease. However, in many cases, the specific cell types and states that confer disease risk through these genes remain unknown. Determining this relationship is crucial for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutic strategies. METHODS: In this study, we utilized the sc-linker framework developed by Jagadeesh, which is an integrated framework that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), epigenomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-to-gene mapping, and GWAS summary statistics to infer potential cell types and diseases affected by genetic variations. RESULTS: Using normal cell type programs in the sc-linker, we identified type 2 alveolar cells in normal lung tissues that are closely associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, we identified cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) associated with lung cancer using disease-dependent programs. By integrating extensive single-cell data from NSCLC, we discerned heterogeneity among CAFs subgroups. Finally, using MAGMA, we identified RAB31 as a driver gene in disease-related fibroblasts. Proteins from the RAB family are involved in the dynamic regulation of cell membrane compartments and are dysregulated in various tumor types, potentially altering biological properties such as the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. We found that the Ras-related protein Rab-31 (RAB31) was significantly overexpressed in tumor-associated fibroblasts compared to that in normal fibroblasts and was closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating scRNA-seq, epigenomic, and GWAS datasets, we found that ACT2 and CAFs have specific disease heritability in lung cancer and identified the driver gene RAB31 as a potential therapeutic target."

It aims to create a protein list expressed in human cells by each chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, akin to the gene list generated by the Human Genome Project. Transmembrane protein 160 (TMEM160) is a member of the transmembrane proteins (TMEM) family. TMEM proteins have been implicated in cancer-related processes, including cell proliferation, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the role of TMEM160 in non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer using cell lines, clinical samples, and xenograft studies. Our findings demonstrated that TMEM160 knockdown decreased the proliferation of lung and cervical cancer cell lines. We observed that TMEM160 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm and dynamic localization during mitosis of cancer cells and discovered a novel interaction between TMEM160 and nuclear proteins such as NUP50. Furthermore, the TMEM160 interactome was enriched in processes associated with apical junctions, xenobiotic metabolism, glycolysis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reactive oxygen species, UV response DNA, the P53 pathway, and the mitotic spindle. This study provides an initial understanding of the function of TMEM160 in lung and cervical cancer progression and clarifies the need to continue investigating the participation of TMEM160 in these cancers."

                "abstract": "Metastasis is complex and insidious type of disease involves multiple signaling nexus, which have implications in understanding disease pathogenesis. Treatment failure for metastatic cancer is frequently high due to aggressive adaptation of cancerous cells to invade to neighboring organs. Cytoskeleton intermediate filamentous protein Vimentin and scaffolding protein Neural precursor cell expressed Developmentally Down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD9) play a key role in metastatic events by regulating multiple metastatic events. Interaction between these proteins is necessary to promote metastatic progression. Withaferin A (WFA), a natural pharamacophore, known to target Vimentin to induce antitumor potential. However exact molecular mechanism still yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize, Vimentin-NEDD9 signaling nexus is necessary for metastatic progression and targeting this interwoven signaling loop with effective pharamacophore WFA halts metastatic progression of melanoma into lung. To elucidate the same, we carried out gene expression measurement through quantitative Reverses Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), Immunoblot and Immunohistochemistry. Assessment of interactive signaling by Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence, Co-localization and Proximity ligation assay. Phosphorylation studies through transfection of phospho specific mutant constructs generated through site directed mutagenesis. WFA induced cellular behavioral changes by migration, invasion assays and Immunoblot analysis. The B16F10 induced mouse metastatic melanoma model to asses NEDD9-Vimentin expression and anti-metastasis induced by WFA. The results postulates, elevated levels and interaction between NEDD9-Vimentin proteins, have positive correlation in metastatic progression of melanoma into lung in both in-vitro and in-vivo condition, establishing it as therapeutic target. Pharmacologically, WFA targets this complex by extending its activity by not only inducing specific Serine 56 phosphorylation of Vimentin, also dissociates NEDD9 signaling loop to halt Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and subsequent metastatic events. Eventually, modulation of the relevant metastatic genes E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, SNAIL, MMP-2 & MMP-9 resulted in regression of metastatic melanoma progression to lung. The study validates WFA induced S56 phosphorylation is necessary to abrupt the NEDD9-Vimentin metastatic signaling complex to regress aggressive metastatic melanoma. The investigation emphasized more mechanistic approach of WFA. Understanding and targeting such integrative mechanical input in the tumor microenvironment will be a better therapeutic strategy to combat metastasis."

                "abstract": "The nature of microRNA (miRNA) dysfunction in carcinogenesis remains controversial because of the complex connection between miRNA structural diversity and biological processes. Here, we found that oncofetal IGF2BP3 regulates the selective production of a subset of 3'-isoforms (3'-isomiRs), including miR-21-5p and Let-7 family, which induces significant changes in their cellular seed occupancy and structural components, establishing a cancer-specific gene expression profile. The D-score, reflecting dominant production of a representative miR-21-5p+C (a 3'-isomiR), discriminated between clinical early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases with low and high recurrence risks, and was associated with molecular features of cell cycle progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition pressure, and immune evasion. We found that IGF2BP3 controls the production of miR-21-5p+C by directing the nuclear Drosha complex to select the cleavage site. IGF2BP3 was also involved in the production of 3'-isomiRs of miR-425-5p and miR-454-3p. IGF2BP3-regulated these three miRNAs are suggested to be associated with the regulation of p53, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF pathways in LUAD. Knockdown of IGF2BP3 also induced a selective upregulation of Let-7 3'-isomiRs, leading to increased cellular Let-7 seed occupancy and broad repression of its target genes encoding cell cycle regulators. The D-score is an index that reflects this cellular situation. Our results suggest that the aberrant regulation of miRNA structural diversity is a critical component for controlling cellular networks, thus supporting the establishment of a malignant gene expression profile in early stage LUAD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiographically, ground-glass nodules (GGN) and part-solid nodules (PSN) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have significant heterogeneity in their clinical manifestations, biological characteristics, and prognosis. This study aimed to explore the heterogeneity of LUAD in different radiological phenotypes and associated factors influencing tumor evolution. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumor tissues from eight and seven cases of GGN- and PSN-LUAD, respectively, at different disease stages, including minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC), and metastatic lung cancer (MLC). Additionally, we analyzed adjacent normal tissues from four cases. Immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and external scRNA-seq data were employed to confirm the expression of signature genes as well as the distribution patterns of CXCL9\u2009+\u2009TAMs and TREM2\u2009+\u2009TAMs. A LUAD mouse model was generated using gene editing, organoid culture, and orthotopic transplantation techniques, and comprehensive analyses such as histopathology, RNA sequencing, and Western blotting were performed to validate key pathways. RESULTS: Diverse cellular compositions were observed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) during GGN- and PSN-LUAD invasion and metastasis. Notably, CXCL9\u2009+\u2009and TREM2\u2009+\u2009tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibited the most significant enrichment changes. It was found that GGN-LUAD exhibited a stronger immune response than PSN-LUAD, with increased interaction between CXCL9\u2009+\u2009TAMs and CD8\u2009+\u2009tissue-resident memory T cells during invasion stage (MIA-IAC). Conversely, greater interactions between TREM2\u2009+\u2009TAMs and tumor cells were observed in PSN-LUAD during the MLC stage. Additionally, TREM2\u2009+\u2009TAMs were found to differentiate into TREM2\u2009+\u2009/SPP1\u2009+\u2009and TREM2\u2009+\u2009/SPP1- TAMs at different stages, which promotes tumor progression. This study also emphasizes that during the transdifferentiation process of GGN- and PSN-LUAD, IFN-\u03b3 activates the STAT1 signaling pathway to regulate the activation of CXCL9\u2009+\u2009TAMs, and further recruiting CD8\u2009+\u2009Trm cells and activating T cells through MHC class I antigen presentation. The role of the IFN-\u03b3/STAT1 pathway in the occurrence and development of LUAD was further validated by animal experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer a potential therapeutic strategy to maintain a dynamic balance within the TME and improve the immunotherapy efficacy by modulating the relative proportions and functional states of CXCL9\u2009+\u2009TAMs and TREM2\u2009+\u2009TAMs."

                "abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease, ranking among the most prevalent malignancies in men. In 2020, there were 1,414,259 new cases of PCa worldwide, accounting for 7.3% of all malignant tumors. The incidence rate of PCa ranks third, following breast cancer and lung cancer. Patients diagnosed with high-grade PCa frequently present with existing or developing metastases, complicating their treatment and resulting in poorer prognoses, particularly for those with bone metastases. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified specific malignant cell subtypes that are closely linked to high-grade PCa. By investigating the mechanisms that govern interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we aim to offer new theoretical insights that can enhance the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PCa, ultimately striving to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. Methods: Data on scRNA-seq was obtained from the GEO database. The gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis were employed to analyze differential expression genes. Using inferCNV analysis to identify malignant epithelial cells. We subsequently employed Monocle, Cytotrace, and Slingshot packages to infer subtype differentiation trajectories. The cellular communication between malignant cell subtypes and other cells was predicted using the CellChat package. Furthermore, we employed pySCENIC to analyze and identify the regulatory networks of transcription factors (TFs) in malignant cell subtypes. The MDA PCa 2b and VCap cell lines were employed to validate the analysis results through cellular functional experiments. In addition, a risk scoring model was developed to assess the variation in clinical characteristics, prognosis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity. Results: A malignant cell subtype in PCa with high expression of NEFH was identified through scRNA-seq analysis. This subtype was situated at the differentiation terminal, exhibited a higher level of malignancy, and exhibited characteristics that were more prone to advanced tumor lesions. In addition, our research underscored the intricate interactions that exist within the TME, particularly the interaction between PTN secreted by this subtype and fibroblasts via the NCL receptor. This interaction may be closely associated with cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor progression. Subsequently, we determined that the NEFH+ malignant cell subtype was significantly correlated with the TF IRX4. This TF is linked to a worse prognosis in PCa and may affect disease progression by regulating gene transcription. Our conclusions were additionally verified through cellular experiments. Furthermore, the prognostic model we developed demonstrated satisfactory predictive performance, with gene sets from the high NmRS group facilitating tumor progression and deterioration. The analysis of immune infiltration was instrumental in the development of clinical intervention strategies and patient prognosis. Conclusion: By examining the cellular heterogeneity of a unique NEFH+ malignant cell subtype within the PCa microenvironment, we were able to disclose their reciprocal interaction with disease progression. This offers a novel viewpoint on the diagnosis and treatment of PCa."

                "abstract": "Background: Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a malignancy with a high mortality rate and complex biological characteristics and heterogeneity, which poses challenges for clinical treatment. Anoikis is a type of programmed cell death that occurs when cells lose their attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and it plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis. However, the specific biological link between anoikis and COAD, as well as its mechanisms in tumor progression, remains unclear, making it a potential new direction for therapeutic strategy research. Methods: We employed transcriptomic data and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to pinpoint differentially expressed anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in COAD. Using Cox proportional hazards models and Lasso regression analysis, we developed a prognostic signature derived from these ARGs. We also investigated the roles and interactions of these genes in the tumor microenvironment by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data. Additionally, we employed molecular docking techniques to evaluate the potential of inhibin subunit beta B (INHBB) as therapeutic targets and to assess the binding affinity of candidate drugs. Finally, we used gene knockout techniques to silence the key gene INHBB and explored its biological functions in vitro. Results: In our study, by analyzing the expression differences of ARGs, we successfully classified patients with COAD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with elevated risk scores experienced poorer prognosis, a finding that was confirmed in both the training and validation cohorts. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis revealed a notable increase in immune cell presence within the tumor microenvironment of high-risk patients. Molecular docking identified potential drug candidates with high binding affinity to INHBB, including risperidone. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with INHBB showed that downregulation of its expression in COAD cell lines significantly reduced cellular viability and migration capacity. Conclusion: In summary, our research, based on the expression characteristics of ARGs, provides new insights into the precise classification, prognosis assessment, and identification of potential therapeutic targets in COAD. It also validates the key role of INHBB in the progression of COAD, establishing the foundation for future personalized treatment strategies."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone tumor. How malignant bone cells coerce the lung microenvironment to support metastatic growth is unclear. The purpose of this study is to identify metastasis-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities by delineating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma lung metastatic niche formation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized genome- and tissue-wide molecular changes induced within lung tissues by disseminated osteosarcoma cells in both immunocompetent murine models of metastasis and patient samples. We confirmed transcriptomic findings at the protein level and determined spatial relationships with multiparameter immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics. Based on these findings, we evaluated the ability of nintedanib, a kinase inhibitor used to treat patients with pulmonary fibrosis, to impair metastasis progression in both immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma and immunodeficient human xenograft models. Single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics were used to perform molecular pharmacodynamic studies that define the effects of nintedanib on tumor and nontumor cells within the metastatic microenvironment. RESULTS: Osteosarcoma cells induced acute alveolar epithelial injury upon lung dissemination. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that the surrounding lung stroma adopts a chronic, nonresolving wound-healing phenotype similar to that seen in other models of lung injury. Accordingly, the metastasis-associated lung demonstrated marked fibrosis, likely because of the accumulation of pathogenic, profibrotic, partially differentiated epithelial intermediates and macrophages. Our data demonstrated that nintedanib prevented metastatic progression in multiple murine and human xenograft models by inhibiting osteosarcoma-induced fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrosis represents a targetable vulnerability to block the progression of osteosarcoma lung metastasis. Our data support a model wherein interactions between osteosarcoma cells and epithelial cells create a prometastatic niche by inducing tumor deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin that is disrupted by the antifibrotic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) nintedanib. Our data shed light on the non-cell-autonomous effects of TKIs on metastasis and provide a roadmap for using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to define the mechanism of action of TKI on metastases in animal models."

                "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the primary subtype of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), accounts for 80 % to 85 % of cases. Due to suboptimal screening method, LUAD is often detected in late stage, leading to aggressive progression and poor outcomes. Therefore, early disease prognosis for the LUAD is high priority. In order to identify early detection biomarkers, we conducted a meta-analysis of mRNA expression TCGA and GTEx datasets from LUAD patients. A total of 795 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by exploring the Network-Analyst tool and utilizing combined effect size methods. DEGs refer to genes whose expression levels are significantly different (either higher or lower) compared to their normal baseline expression levels. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted the TNF signaling pathway as being prominently associated with these DEGs. Subsequently, using the MCODE and CytoHubba plugins in Cytoscape software, we filtered out the top 10 genes. Among these, SOX2 was the only gene exhibiting higher expression, while the others were downregulated. Consequently, our subsequent research focused on SOX2. Further transcription factor-gene network analysis revealed that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a significant partner of SOX2, potentially playing a crucial role in euchromatin-heterochromatin dynamics. Structure of SOX2 protein suggest that it is a non-druggable transcription factor, literature survey suggests the same. SOX2 is considered challenging to target directly, or \"non-druggable,\" because of several intrinsic properties that make it difficult to design effective therapeutic agents against it. The primary function of SOX2 is to bind DNA and regulates gene expression. Unlike enzymes or receptors with defined active sites or binding pockets, transcription factors typically have relatively flat or diffuse surfaces that do not offer obvious \"pockets\" for small molecules to bind effectively. Hence, we drove our focus to investigate on potential drug(s) targeting EZH2. Molecular docking analyses predicted most probable inhibitors of EZH2. We employed several predictive analysis tools and identified GSK343, as a promising inhibitor of EZH2."

In this study, we investigated the function and underlying molecular mechanism of ribosome biogenesis factor (RBIS) in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The immunofluorescence technology was utilized to study the subcellular reorganization of the nucleolus. We conducted co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays followed by Western blot analysis to identify potential proteins interacted with RBIS. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was used for evaluating the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells to gemcitabine. Additionally, the colony formation assay was employed to assess the survival and proliferative capacity post-treatment of gemcitabine. RESULTS: The database analysis showed that RBIS was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, and its high expression was associated with poor prognosis; Knockdown of RBIS significantly inhibited NSCLC cell migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Additionally, knockdown of RBIS led to G0/G1 phase arrest and significantly increased apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistically, downregulation of RBIS significantly decreased the expression of 47S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a component associated with ribosome assembly. Polysome profiling analysis indicated that RBIS knockdown affected protein translation efficiency, and global protein synthesis assay further verified that RBIS knockdown inhibited synthesis of newborn proteins. Additionally, the ribosomal biogenesis-targeting drugs CX-5461 and the loss of RBIS exhibited synergistic effects in inhibiting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the ribosomal maturation factor GNL2 was identified as the key downstream regulator of RBIS in ribosome biogenesis. Notably, knockdown of RBIS substantially increased the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma cells to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine, highlighting its l role in chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these studies suggested the close involvement of RBIS in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, providing new insights for targeted therapeutic interventions involving ribosomes."

However, its role in cancer progression, especially in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we observed significantly lower expression of PKHD1L1 in LUAD tissues than in normal lung tissues on the basis of the integration of public datasets from the TCGA and GEO cohorts. Furthermore, we found that low PKHD1L1 expression was a strong predictor of poor prognosis in patients with LUAD. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that PKHD1L1 is associated primarily with asthma and multiple immune processes. Through meticulous analysis of immune cell infiltrates and single-cell datasets, we discerned a notable correlation between the expression of PKHD1L1 and the presence of B cells, with a particularly strong association observed in plasma cells. This finding led us to believe that the role of PKHD1L1 may extend beyond its previously reported involvement in cellular immunity, potentially impacting humoral immunity as well. In vitro experiments revealed that the over-expression of PKHD1L1 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration ability of LUAD cell lines. These findings suggest that PKHD1L1 is an important prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target for LUAD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) stands as the most prevalent subtype among lung cancers. Interactions between stromal and cancer cells influence tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of stromal cells in the lung adenocarcinoma tumor microenvironment remain unclear. This study seeks to elucidate the regulatory connections among critical pathogenic genes and their associated expression variations within distinct stromal cell subtypes. METHOD: Analysis and investigation were conducted on a total of 114,019 single-cell RNA data and 346 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD-related samples using bioinformatics and statistical algorithms. Differential gene expression analysis was performed for tumor samples and controls, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Differential genes between stromal cells and other cell clusters were identified and intersected with the differential genes from TCGA. We employed a combination of LASSO regression and multivariable Cox regression to identify the ultimate set of pathogenic gene. Survival models were trained to predict the relationship between patient survival and these pathogenic genes. Analysis of transcription factor (TF) cell specificity and pseudotime trajectories within stromal cell subpopulations revealed that vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and matrix cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key in regulation of the prognosis-associated genes CAV2, COL1A1, TIMP1, ETS2, AKAP12, ID1 and COL1A2. RESULTS: Seven pathogenic genes associated with LUAD in stromal cells were identified and used to develop a survival model. High expression of these genes is linked to a greater risk of poor survival. Stromal cells were categorized into eight subtypes and one unannotated cluster. Mesothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and matrix cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) showed cell-specific regulation of the pathogenic genes. CONCLUSIONS: The seven disease-causing genes in vascular ECs and matrix CAFs can be used to detect the survival status of LUAD patients, providing new directions for future targeted drug design."

                "abstract": "Ku70, a DNA repair protein, binds to the damaged DNA ends and orchestrates the recruitment of other proteins to facilitate repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Besides its essential role in DNA repair, several studies have highlighted nonclassical functions of Ku70 in cellular processes. However, its function in immune homeostasis and antitumor immunity remains unknown. Here, we discovered a marked association between elevated Ku70 expression and unfavorable prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma, focusing specifically on increased Ku70 levels in tumor-infiltrated Tregs. Using a lung-colonizing tumor model in mice with Treg-specific Ku70 deficiency, we demonstrated that deletion of Ku70 in Tregs led to a stronger antitumor response and slower tumor growth due to impaired immune-suppressive capacity of Tregs. Furthermore, we confirmed that Ku70 played a critical role in sustaining the suppressive function of human Tregs. We found that Ku70 bound to forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) and occupied FOXP3-bound genomic sites to support its transcriptional activities. These findings not only unveil a nonhomologous end joining-independent (NHEJ-independent) role of Ku70 crucial for Treg-suppressive function, but also underscore the potential of targeting Ku70 as an effective strategy in cancer therapy, aiming to both restrain cancer cells and enhance pulmonary antitumor immunity."

                "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by its aggressive nature and dismal prognosis, largely attributed to its unique tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms by which tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote PDAC progression, particularly the role of \u03b2-catenin signaling in regulating TAM phenotype and function, remain incompletely understood. Initially, we performed comprehensive analyses of RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets to investigate OSM and LOXL2 expression patterns in PDAC. Subsequently, the regulatory relationship between \u03b2-catenin and OSM in TAMs was examined using THP-1-derived macrophages. Furthermore, the functional impact of TAM-derived OSM on PDAC progression was evaluated through in vitro co-culture systems and an in vivo Panc02 lung metastasis model. Additionally, mechanistic studies employed pharmacological inhibitors and genetic approaches targeting \u03b2-catenin, OSM, and STAT3 signaling. Notably, elevated expression of OSM and LOXL2 in PDAC specimens significantly correlated with poor patient survival. Intriguingly, scRNA-seq analysis revealed that \u03b2-catenin signaling was uniquely activated in TAMs among immune cells, which consequently regulated both TAM polarization and OSM expression. These OSM-expressing TAMs exhibited a distinct hybrid M1/M2 phenotype. Besides, our transcriptional profiling of TAMs revealed concurrent activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory programs, with enrichment in Wnt signaling pathways. RNA-seq analysis of PDAC cells exposed to TAM-derived factors demonstrated enhanced mesenchymal transition and stemness properties, with direct enrichment of OSM signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Mechanistically, \u03b2-catenin activation directly regulated both TAM phenotype and OSM expression, while TAM-conditioned medium enhanced PDAC cell migration, invasion, and lung metastasis. Importantly, inhibition of \u03b2-catenin signaling simultaneously altered TAM polarization and reduced OSM expression, which substantially attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in co-cultured PDAC cells. Moreover, STAT3 inhibition abolished OSM-induced LOXL2 expression and subsequent EMT programming. Collectively, we identified a novel \u03b2-catenin/OSM-STAT3/LOXL2 signaling axis mediating TAM-induced PDAC progression. This pathway not only elucidates a previously unrecognized mechanism of \u03b2-catenin-mediated regulation of TAM function and phenotype but also presents potential therapeutic targets for intervention."

                "title": "Multiomics analysis reveals the involvement of NET1 in tumour immune regulation and malignant progression.",
                "abstract": "Neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1 (NET1) is a member of the Ras homologue family member A\u00a0(RhoA) subfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and a key protein involved in the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases, which act as regulators of cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and cell movement and are crucial for cancer spread. Research has shown that NET1 can regulate the malignant biological functions of tumour cells, such as growth, invasion, and metastasis, and it is closely related to the progression of pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer. However, the comprehensive role and mechanistic function of NET1 in other types of cancer remain largely unexplored. A deeper understanding of the role of NET1 may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression and metastasis.\u00a0This study aims to fill this knowledge gap and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of NET1 in cancer biology. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were utilized to analyse the differential expression of NET1 in normal and cancer tissues. The prognostic value of NET1 in cancer was evaluated through log-rank tests and Cox regression models. Further analysis was conducted to assess the relationships between NET1 expression and clinical features, as well as its diagnostic value. We investigated potential factors contributing to genetic alterations in NET1 to elucidate the role of NET1 in cancer progression. We also explored the relationships between NET1 and genes associated with epigenetic modifications, oncogenes, and tumour characteristics, such as RNA stemness scores (RNAss), DNA stemness scores (DNAss), the tumour mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Additionally, we analysed the associations between NET1 expression and immune cell infiltration, immunoregulatory genes, and sensitivity to therapeutic drugs. We conducted gene set enrichment analysis to further investigate the signalling pathways that might be affected by changes in NET1. The prognostic value of NET1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was further validated using real-world and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data. Finally, through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we confirmed that the overexpression of NET1 contributed to the malignant progression of TNBC cells, and we explored the potential mechanism by which NET1 regulates malignant biological behaviour through cellular experiments. Our study revealed a higher expression level of NET1 in 18 types of tumour tissues than in their corresponding normal tissues. Specifically, we observed high expression of NET1 in LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA tumour tissues, which was associated with a poor prognosis. In terms of gene alterations, \"amplification\", \"mutation\", and \"deep deletion\" were identified as the main types of changes occurring in NET1. Among these, \"amplification\" was predominantly observed in LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between copy number variations and the NET1 expression level in various tumours, including LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA. We also discovered that NET1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to epigenetic modification in almost all types of cancer and was related to the expression levels of numerous oncogenes. In certain tumours, a significant positive correlation was noted between the expression of NET1 and TMB, MSI, DNAss, and RNAss. Intriguingly, in most tumours, NET1 expression was strongly negatively correlated with the levels of infiltrating natural killer cells and M1 macrophages. Moreover, NET1 expression was significantly positively correlated with the expression of immune genes in nearly all types of cancer. An analysis of single-cell data revealed that NET1 was expressed primarily in malignant tumour cells in most tumours, with little to no expression in immune cells. Additionally, the expression level of NET1 was associated with sensitivity to various therapeutic drugs. Data from GEO and real-world studies indicated high expression of NET1 in TNBC tissues, which was correlated with a poor prognosis. Cellular experiments indicated that NET1 could regulate the proliferation, invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis of TNBC cells. Furthermore, NET1 may mediate the malignant proliferation of tumour cells through the AKT signalling pathway. NET1 can serve as a potential prognostic marker for LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA tumours. Real-world data further suggest that NET1 can also serve as a prognostic indicator for TNBC. High expression of NET1 may contribute to the malignant proliferation of TNBC cells, potentially through the AKT signalling pathway. Moreover, NET1 may contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that can promote tumour progression. Therefore, targeting NET1 may represents a promising approach for inhibiting tumour progression."

            "abstract": "Speciation leads to adaptive changes in organ cellular physiology and creates challenges for studying rare cell-type functions that diverge between humans and mice. Rare cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-rich pulmonary ionocytes exist throughout the cartilaginous airways of humans1,2, but limited presence and divergent biology in the proximal trachea of mice has prevented the use of traditional transgenic models to elucidate ionocyte functions in the airway. Here we describe the creation and use of conditional genetic ferret models to dissect pulmonary ionocyte biology and function by enabling ionocyte lineage tracing (FOXI1-CreERT2::ROSA-TG), ionocyte ablation (FOXI1-KO) and ionocyte-specific deletion of CFTR (FOXI1-CreERT2::CFTRL/L). By comparing these models with cystic fibrosis ferrets3,4, we demonstrate that ionocytes control airway surface liquid absorption, secretion, pH and mucus viscosity-leading to reduced airway surface liquid volume and impaired mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis, FOXI1-KO and FOXI1-CreERT2::CFTRL/L ferrets. These processes are regulated by CFTR-dependent ionocyte transport of Cl- and HCO3-. Single-cell transcriptomics and in vivo lineage tracing revealed three subtypes of pulmonary ionocytes and a FOXI1-lineage common rare cell progenitor for ionocytes, tuft cells and neuroendocrine cells during airway development. Thus, rare pulmonary ionocytes perform critical CFTR-dependent functions in the proximal airway that are hallmark features of cystic fibrosis airway disease. These studies provide a road map for using conditional genetics in the first non-rodent mammal to address gene function, cell biology and disease processes that have greater evolutionary conservation between humans and ferrets."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary ionocytes have been identified in the airway epithelium as a small population of ion transporting cells expressing high levels of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis. By providing an infinite source of airway epithelial cells (AECs), the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) could overcome some challenges of studying ionocytes. However, the production of AEC epithelia containing ionocytes from hiPSCs has proven difficult. Here, we present a platform to produce hiPSC-derived AECs (hiPSC-AECs) including ionocytes and investigate their role in the airway epithelium. METHODS: hiPSCs were differentiated into lung progenitors, which were expanded as 3D organoids and matured by air-liquid interface culture as polarised hiPSC-AEC epithelia. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a hiPSCs knockout (KO) for FOXI1, a transcription factor that is essential for ionocyte specification. Differences between FOXI1 KO hiPSC-AECs and their wild-type (WT) isogenic controls were investigated by assessing gene and protein expression, epithelial composition, cilia coverage and motility, pH and transepithelial barrier properties. RESULTS: Mature hiPSC-AEC epithelia contained basal cells, secretory cells, ciliated cells with motile cilia, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and ionocytes. There was no difference between FOXI1 WT and KO hiPSCs in terms of their capacity to differentiate into airway progenitors. However, FOXI1 KO led to mature hiPSC-AEC epithelia without ionocytes with reduced capacity to produce ciliated cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ionocytes could have role beyond transepithelial ion transport by regulating epithelial properties and homeostasis in the airway epithelium."

We developed 'pulse-seq', combining scRNA-seq and lineage tracing, to show that tuft, neuroendocrine and ionocyte cells are continually and directly replenished by basal progenitor cells. Ionocytes are the major source of transcripts of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in both mouse (Cftr) and human (CFTR). Knockout of Foxi1 in mouse ionocytes causes loss of Cftr expression and disrupts airway fluid and mucus physiology, phenotypes that are\u00a0characteristic of cystic fibrosis. By associating cell-type-specific expression programs with key disease genes, we establish a new cellular narrative for airways disease."

                "abstract": "The airway surface liquid (ASL) plays a crucial role in lung defense mechanisms, and its composition and volume are regulated by the airway epithelium. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is abundantly expressed in a rare airway epithelial cell type called an ionocyte. Recently, we demonstrated that ionocytes can increase liquid absorption through apical CFTR and basolateral barttin/chloride channels, while airway secretory cells mediate liquid secretion through apical CFTR channels and basolateral NKCC1 transporters. Th2-driven (IL-4/IL-13) airway diseases, such as asthma, cause goblet cell metaplasia, accompanied by increased mucus production and airway secretions. In this study, we investigate the effect of IL-13 on chloride and liquid transport performed by ionocytes. IL-13 treatment of human airway epithelia was associated with reduced epithelial liquid absorption rates and increased ASL volume. Additionally, IL-13 treatment reduced the abundance of CFTR-positive ionocytes and increased the abundance of CFTR-positive secretory cells. Increasing ionocyte abundance attenuated liquid secretion caused by IL-13. Finally, CFTR-positive ionocytes were less common in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and were associated with airflow obstruction. Our findings suggest that loss of CFTR in ionocytes contributes to the liquid secretion observed in IL-13-mediated airway diseases."

Aspergillus fumigatus frequently colonizes CF airways, but it has been assumed to be an innocent saprophyte; its potential role as a cause of lung disease is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To study the interactions between Aspergillus and EC, and the role of the fungus in evoking inflammatory responses. METHODS: A. fumigatus expressing green fluorescent protein was developed for in vitro and in vivo models, which used cell lines and mouse tracheal EC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fungal spores (conidia) are rapidly ingested by ECs derived from bronchial cell lines and murine tracheas, supporting a role for EC in early airway clearance. Bronchial ECs harboring CFTR mutations (\u0394F508) or deletion demonstrate impaired uptake and killing of conidia, and ECs with CFTR mutation undergo more conidial-induced apoptosis. Germinated (hyphal) forms of the fungus evoke secretion of inflammatory mediators, with CFTR mutation resulting in increased airway levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and KC, and higher lung monocyte chemotactic protein-1. After A. fumigatus inhalation, CFTR(-/-) mice develop exaggerated lymphocytic inflammation, mucin accumulation, and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Data demonstrate a critical role for CFTR in mediating EC responses to A. fumigatus. Results suggest that the fungus elicits aberrant pulmonary inflammation in the setting of CFTR mutation, supporting the potential role of antifungals to halt progressive CF lung disease."

However, the cellular mechanisms that govern ionocyte specification and function remain unclear. We observed that increased abundance of ionocytes in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelium was associated with enhanced expression of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) effectors. In this study, we evaluated whether the SHH pathway directly impacts ionocyte differentiation and CFTR function in airway epithelia. Pharmacological HPI1-mediated inhibition of SHH signaling component GLI1 significantly impaired human basal cell specification of ionocytes and ciliated cells but significantly enhanced specification of secretory cells. By contrast, activation of the SHH pathway effector smoothened (SMO) with the chemical agonist SAG significantly enhanced ionocyte specification. The abundance of CFTR+ BSND+ ionocytes under these conditions had a direct relationship with CFTR-mediated currents in differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) airway cultures. These findings were corroborated in ferret ALI airway cultures generated from basal cells in which the genes encoding the SHH receptor PTCH1 or its intracellular effector SMO were genetically ablated using CRISPR-Cas9, causing aberrant activation or suppression of SHH signaling, respectively. These findings demonstrate that SHH signaling is directly involved in airway basal cell specification of CFTR-expressing pulmonary ionocytes and is likely responsible for enhanced ionocyte abundance in the CF proximal airways. Pharmacologic approaches to enhance ionocyte and reduce secretory cell specification after CFTR gene editing of basal cells may have utility in the treatment of CF."

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recently observed in CF lungs and certain CFTR mutation classes may be more susceptible than others. No investigations of EMT processes in CF animal models have been reported. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the expression of EMT-related markers in Phe508del and knockout (CFTR-KO) rat lung tissue and tracheal-derived basal epithelial stem cells, to determine whether CFTR dysfunction can produce an EMT state. METHOD: The expression of EMT-related markers in lung tissue and cultured tracheal basal epithelial stem cells from wildtype (WT), Phe508del, and CFTR-KO rats were assessed using qPCR and Western blots. Cell responses were evaluated in the presence of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632, which blocks EMT-pathways, or after treatment with TGF\u03b21 to stimulate EMT. RESULTS: Different gene expression profiles were observed between Phe508del and CFTR-KO rat models compared to wild type. There was lower expression of type 1 collagen in KO lungs and primary cell cultures, while Phe508del lungs and cells had higher expression, particularly when treated with TGF\u03b21. The addition of Y27632 rescued changes in EMT related genes in Phe508del cells but not in KO cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the first evidence of upregulated EMT pathways in the lungs and airway cells of any CF animal model. Differences in the regulation of the EMT genes and proteins in the Phe508del and CFTR-KO cells suggest that the signalling pathways underlying EMT are CFTR mutation dependent."

We found a relatively high (~3%) ionocyte abundance in ex vivo nasal samples, with no difference between CF and control individuals. In bronchi, ionocytes instead appeared very rarely as previously reported, thus suggesting a possible proximal-distal gradient in human airways. The difference between nasal and bronchial epithelial cells was maintained in culture, which suggests an epigenetic control of ionocyte development. In the differentiation phase of the culture procedure, we used two media that resulted in a different pattern of CFTR expression: confined to ionocytes or more broadly expressed. CFTR function was similar in both conditions, thus indicating that chloride secretion equally occurs irrespective of CFTR expression pattern."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with subtype classification according to dominant airway infiltrates, including eosinophilic (Type 2 high), or non-eosinophilic asthma. Non-eosinophilic asthma is further divided into paucigranulocytic or neutrophilic asthma characterized by elevated neutrophils, and mixed Type 1 and Type 17 cytokines in the airways. Severe non-eosinophilic asthma has few effective treatments and many patients do not qualify for biologic therapies. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is dysregulated in multiple respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has proven a valuable therapeutic target. We hypothesized that the CFTR may also play a role in non-eosinophilic asthma. METHODS: Patient-derived human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs) were isolated and differentiated at the air-liquid interface. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was used to identify epithelial cell subtypes and transcriptional activity. Ion transport was investigated with Ussing chambers and immunofluorescent quantification of ionocyte abundance in human airway epithelial cells and murine models of asthma. RESULTS: We identified that hBECs from patients with non-eosinophilic asthma had reduced CFTR function, and did not differentiate into CFTR-expressing ionocytes compared to those from eosinophilic asthma or healthy donors. Similarly, ionocytes were also diminished in the airways of a murine model of neutrophilic-dominant but not eosinophilic asthma. Treatment of hBECs from healthy donors with a neutrophilic asthma-like inflammatory cytokine mixture led to a reduction in ionocytes. CONCLUSION: Inflammation-induced loss of CFTR-expressing ionocytes in airway cells from non-eosinophilic asthma may represent a key feature of disease pathogenesis and a novel drug target."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic fibrosis is an early diagnostic feature of the common inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). Many people with CF (pwCF) are pancreatic insufficient from birth and the replacement of acinar tissue with cystic lesions and fibrosis is a progressive phenotype that may later lead to diabetes. Little is known about the initiating events in the fibrotic process though it may be a sequela of inflammation in the pancreatic ducts resulting from loss of CFTR impairing normal fluid secretion. Here we use a sheep model of CF (CFTR-/-) to examine the evolution of pancreatic disease through gestation. METHODS: Fetal pancreas was collected at six time points from 50-days of gestation through to term, which is equivalent to\u2009~\u200913\u00a0weeks to term in human. RNA was extracted from tissue for bulk RNA-seq and single cells were prepared from 80-day, 120-day and term samples for scRNA-seq. Data were validated by immunochemistry. RESULTS: Transcriptomic evidence from bulk RNA-seq showed alterations in the CFTR-/- pancreas by 65-days of gestation, which are accompanied by marked pathological changes by 80-days of gestation. These include a fibrotic response, confirmed by immunostaining for COL1A1, \u03b1SMA and SPARC, together with acinar loss. Moreover, using scRNA-seq we identify a unique cell population that is significantly overrepresented in the CFTR-/- animals at 80- and 120-days gestation, as are stellate cells at term. CONCLUSION: The transcriptomic changes and cellular imbalance that we observe likely have pivotal roles in the evolution of CF pancreatic disease and may provide therapeutic opportunities to delay or prevent pancreatic destruction in CF."

                "abstract": "The combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI, Trikafta) reverses the primary defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) by improving CFTR-mediated Cl- and HCO3- secretion by airway epithelial cells (AECs), leading to improved lung function and less frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations. However, studies have shown that CFTR modulators like ivacaftor, a component of ETI, have numerous effects on CF cells beyond improved CFTR channel function. Because little is known about the effect of ETI on CF AEC gene expression, we exposed primary human AEC to ETI for 48 h and interrogated the transcriptome by RNA-seq and qPCR. ETI increased CFTR Cl- secretion, and defensin gene expression (DEFB1), an observation consistent with reports of decreased bacterial burden in the lungs of people with CF (pwCF). ETI decreased MMP10 and MMP12 gene expression, suggesting that ETI may reduce proteolytic-induced lung destruction in CF. ETI also reduced the expression of the stress response gene heme oxygenase (HMOX1). qPCR analysis confirmed DEFB1, HMOX1, MMP10, and MMP12 gene expression results observed by RNA-seq. Gene pathway analysis revealed that ETI decreased inflammatory signaling, cellular proliferation, and MHC class II antigen presentation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the clinical observation that ETI reduces lung infections in pwCF is related in part to drug-induced increases in DEFB1 and that ETI may reduce lung damage by reducing MMP10 and MMP12 gene expression. Moreover, pathway analysis also identified several other genes responsible for the ETI-induced reduction in inflammation observed in pwCF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Gene expression responses by CF AECs exposed to ETI suggest that in addition to improving CFTR channel function, ETI is likely to enhance resistance to bacterial infection by increasing levels of beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1). ETI may also reduce lung damage by suppressing MMP10 and MMP12 and reduce airway inflammation by repressing proinflammatory cytokine secretion by CF AECs."

                "abstract": "In contrast to pig large airways, the pH of airway surface liquid (ASL) in pig small airways is regulated by CFTR-mediated HCO-3 secretion and the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) proton secretion. We hypothesized that, in cystic fibrosis (CF), the ASL pH of small airways is acidic, and the V-ATPase is internalized. We quantified proton secretion during the addition of an alkaline test solution by measuring changes in a pH-dependent fluorescent dye generated by porcine small airway epithelia in the absence and presence of bafilomycin A1. The pH-dependent translocation of V-ATPase in ex vivo and in vivo preparations was measured using immunolocalization of V-ATPase. We found that bafilomycin-sensitive proton secretion stopped when the ASL pH was less than 7.10. In non-CF pigs and mice, we found that V-ATPase was localized in the apical membrane, and internalized when the lungs were instilled with a pH 6.8 solution. Studies in which we immediately fixed lungs from pigs revealed apical V-ATPase detection in non-CF piglets and less apical detection in CF piglets. Our data suggest that V-ATPase in small airways is internalized when the ASL pH is acidic. The decrease in apical localization of V-ATPase in CF pigs is consistent with an acidic ASL pH.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we describe that vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) internalizes when the airway surface liquid (ASL) pH in pig small airways is less than 7.10. Furthermore, we found that V-ATPase is not localized to the apical membrane in the small airways of newborn cystic fibrosis pigs."

                "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel that is dysfunctional in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). The permeability of CFTR can be experimentally manipulated though different mechanisms, including activation via inducing the phosphorylation of residues in the regulatory domain as well as altering the gating/open probability of the channel. Phosphorylation/activation of the channel is achieved by exposure to compounds that increase intracellular cAMP, with forskolin and IBMX commonly used for this purpose. Cact-A1 is a unique CFTR activator that does not increase intracellular cAMP, and VX-770 (ivacaftor) is a CFTR potentiator that is used experimentally and therapeutically to increase the open probability of the channel. Using primary human nasal epithelial cell (HNEC) cultures and Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells exogenously expressing functional CFTR, we examined the impact of VX-770, Cact-A1, and forskolin/IBMX on CFTR activity during analysis in an Ussing chamber. Relative contributions of these compounds to maximal CFTR activity were dependent on order of exposure, the presence of chemical and electrical gradients, the level of constitutive CFTR function, and the cell model tested. Increasing intracellular cAMP appeared to change cellular functions outside of CFTR activity that resulted in alterations in the drive for chloride through CFTR. These results demonstrate that one can utilize combinations of small-molecule CFTR activators and potentiators to provide detailed characterization of CFTR-mediated ion transport in primary HNECs and properties of these modulators in both primary HNECs and FRT cells. Future studies using these approaches may assist in the identification of novel defects in CFTR function and the identification of modulators with unique impacts on CFTR-mediated ion transport."

                "abstract": "Some residues in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel are the site of more than one CFTR variant that cause cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the function of S1159F and S1159P, two variants associated with different clinical phenotypes, which affect the same pore-lining residue in transmembrane segment 12 that are both strongly potentiated by ivacaftor when expressed in CFBE41o- bronchial epithelial cells. To study the single-channel behaviour of CFTR, we applied the patch-clamp technique to Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing CFTR variants incubated at 27\u00b0C to enhance channel residence at the plasma membrane. S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR formed Cl- channels activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and gated by ATP that exhibited thermostability at 37\u00b0C. Both variants modestly reduced the single-channel conductance of CFTR. By severely attenuating channel gating, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR reduced the open probability (Po ) of wild-type CFTR by \u226575% at ATP (1\u00a0mM); S1159F-CFTR caused the greater decrease in Po consistent with its more severe clinical phenotype. Ivacaftor (10-100\u00a0nM) doubled the Po of both CFTR variants without restoring Po values to wild-type levels, but concomitantly, ivacaftor decreased current flow through open channels. For S1159F-CFTR, the reduction of current flow was marked at high (supersaturated) ivacaftor concentrations (0.5-1\u00a0\u03bcM) and voltage-independent, identifying an additional detrimental action of elevated ivacaftor concentrations. In conclusion, S1159F and S1159P are gating variants, which also affect CFTR processing and conduction, but not stability, necessitating the use of combinations of CFTR modulators to optimally restore their channel activity. KEY POINTS: Dysfunction of the ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) causes the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). This study investigated two rare pathogenic CFTR variants, S1159F and S1159P, which affect the same amino acid in CFTR, to understand the molecular basis of disease and response to the CFTR-targeted therapy ivacaftor. Both rare variants diminished CFTR function by modestly reducing current flow through the channel and severely inhibiting ATP-dependent channel gating with S1159F exerting the stronger adverse effect, which correlates with its association with more severe disease. Ivacaftor potentiated channel gating by both rare variants without restoring their activity to wild-type levels, but concurrently reduced current flow through open channels, particularly those of S1159F-CFTR. Our data demonstrate that S1159F and S1159P cause CFTR dysfunction by multiple mechanisms that require combinations of CFTR-targeted therapies to fully restore channel function."

                "abstract": "ORKAMBI, a combination of the corrector, lumacaftor, and the potentiator, ivacaftor, partially rescues the defective processing and anion channel activity conferred by the major cystic fibrosis-causing mutation, F508del, in in vitro studies. Clinically, the improvement in lung function after ORKAMBI treatment is modest and variable, prompting the search for complementary interventions. As our previous work identified a positive effect of arginine-dependent nitric oxide signaling on residual F508del-Cftr function in murine intestinal epithelium, we were prompted to determine whether strategies aimed at increasing arginine would enhance F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel activity in patient-derived airway epithelia. Now, we show that the addition of arginine together with inhibition of intracellular arginase activity increased cytosolic nitric oxide and enhanced the rescue effect of ORKAMBI on F508del-CFTR-mediated chloride conductance at the cell surface of patient-derived bronchial and nasal epithelial cultures. Interestingly, arginine addition plus arginase inhibition also enhanced ORKAMBI-mediated increases in ciliary beat frequency and mucociliary movement, two in vitro CF phenotypes that are downstream of the channel defect. This work suggests that strategies to manipulate the arginine-nitric oxide pathway in combination with CFTR modulators may lead to improved clinical outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: These proof-of-concept studies highlight the potential to boost the response to cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, lumacaftor and ivacaftor, in patient-derived airway tissues expressing the major CF-causing mutant, F508del-CFTR, by enhancing other regulatory pathways. In this case, we observed enhancement of pharmacologically rescued F508del-CFTR by arginine-dependent, nitric oxide signaling through inhibition of endogenous arginase activity."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) is a chronic cholangiopathy that increases morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Current treatments are unsatisfactory, and incomplete understanding of CFLD pathogenesis hampers therapeutic development. We have previously shown that mouse CF cholangiocytes respond to lipopolysaccharide with excessive inflammation. Thus, we investigated the role of the gut-liver axis in the pathogenesis of CFLD. METHODS: Wild-type (WT), whole-body Cftr knockout (CFTR-KO) and gut-corrected (CFTR-KO-GC) mice were studied. Liver changes were assessed by immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptomics (single-cell RNA sequencing), inflammatory mediators were analysed by proteome array, faecal microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and gut permeability by FITC-dextran assay. RESULTS: The livers of CFTR-KO mice showed ductular proliferation and periportal inflammation, whereas livers of CFTR-KO-GC mice had no evident pathology. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of periportal cells showed increased presence of neutrophils, macrophages and T cells, and activation of pro-inflammatory and pathogen-mediated immune pathways in CFTR-KO livers, consistent with a response to gut-derived stimuli. CFTR-KO mice exhibited gut dysbiosis with enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp., which was associated with increased intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation, whereas gut dysbiosis and inflammation were absent in CFTR-KO-GC mice. Treatment with nonabsorbable antibiotics ameliorated intestinal permeability and liver inflammation in CFTR-KO mice. Faecal microbiota transfer from CFTR-KO to germ-free WT mice did not result in dysbiosis nor liver pathology, indicating that defective intestinal CFTR is required to maintain dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: Defective CFTR in the gut sustains a pathogenic microbiota, creates an inflammatory milieu, and alters intestinal permeability. These changes are necessary for the development of cholangiopathy. Restoring CFTR in the intestine or modulating the microbiota could be a promising strategy to prevent or attenuate liver disease. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Severe cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) affects 10% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment options remain limited due to a lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mediates Cl- and HCO3- secretion in the biliary epithelium and its defective function is thought to cause cholestasis and excessive inflammatory responses in CF. However, our study in Cftr-knockout mice demonstrates that microbial dysbiosis, combined with increased intestinal permeability caused by defective CFTR in the intestinal mucosa, acts as a necessary co-factor for the development of CFLD-like liver pathology in mice. These findings uncover a major role for the gut microbiota in CFLD pathogenesis and call for further investigation and clinical validation to develop targeted therapeutic strategies acting on the gut-liver axis in CF."

While gene therapy holds promise as a cure, the cell-type-specific heterogeneity of CFTR expression in the lung presents significant challenges. Current CF ferret models closely replicate the human disease phenotype but have limitations in studying functional complementation through cell-type-specific CFTR restoration. To address this, we developed a new transgenic ferret line, CFTRint1-eGFP(lsl), in which a Cre-recombinase (Cre)-excisable enhanced fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter cassette is knocked in (KI) to intron 1 of the CFTR locus. Breeding this reporter line with CFTRG551D CF ferret resulted in a novel CF model, CFTRint1-eGFP(lsl)/G551D, with disease onset manageable via the administration of CFTR modulator VX770. In this study, we confirmed two key properties of the CFTRint1-eGFP(lsl)/G551D CF ferrets: (1) cell-type-specific expression of the CFTR(N-24)-eGFP fusion protein, driven by the intrinsic CFTR promoter, in polarized epithelial cultures and selected tissues, and (2) functional reversion of the KI allele via Cre-mediated excision of the reporter cassette. This model provides a valuable tool for studying the effects of targeted CFTR reactivation in a cell-type-specific manner, which is crucial for enhancing our understanding of CFTR's roles in modulating airway clearance and innate immunity, and for identifying relevant cellular targets for CF gene therapy."

                "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel, ultimately leading to diminished transepithelial anion secretion and mucociliary clearance. CFTR correctors are therapeutics that restore the folding/trafficking of mutated CFTR to the plasma membrane. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa, KCa1.1) is also critical for maintaining lung airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. Here, we show that the class 2 (C2) CFTR corrector VX-445 (elexacaftor) induces K+ secretion across WT and F508del CFTR primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs), which was entirely inhibited by the BKCa antagonist paxilline. Similar results were observed with VX-121, a corrector under clinical evaluation. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings verified that CFTR correctors potentiated BKCa activity from both primary HBEs and HEK cells stably expressing the \u03b1 subunit (HEK-BK cells). Furthermore, excised patch-clamp recordings from HEK-BK cells verified direct action on the channel and demonstrated a significant increase in open probability. In mouse mesenteric artery, VX-445 induced a paxilline-sensitive vasorelaxation of preconstricted arteries. VX-445 also reduced firing frequency in primary rat hippocampal and cortical neurons. We raise the possibilities that C2 CFTR correctors gain additional clinical benefit by activation of BKCa in the lung yet may lead to adverse events through BKCa activation elsewhere."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. For people with CF (pwCF) affected by the most common pathogenic variant F508del, a tritherapy, named Trikafta/Kaftrio (ETI: elexacaftor (VX-445) /tezacaftor (VX-661) / ivacaftor (VX-770)) was successfully developed. However, in CF airway epithelial cells the calcium homeostasis is also disturbed; it is observed an increased calcium mobilization in CF cells compared to non-CF cells. Here, we studied the effects of ETI on intracellular calcium levels in F508del-CFTR airway epithelial cells to determine whether these compounds, individually or collectively, could normalize intracellular calcium levels. METHODS: We measured intracellular calcium variations using human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) from pwCF, human bronchial epithelial CFBE41o- F508del-CFTR cells and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using the fluorescent probe Fluo4-AM, in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium. The rescue to the plasma membrane of F508del-CFTR protein by ETI was determined by western blot. The SarcoEndoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA), was also analysed by western blotting and by interference assay. RESULTS: We show that ETI normalizes calcium homeostasis in our cellular models. However, we also found that (1) each ETI-corrector compound is capable of mobilizing calcium acutely in the absence of CFTR, and (2) tezacaftor mobilizes calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) probably via inhibition of the SERCA pump. CONCLUSIONS: We show that ETI not only corrects the abnormal trafficking and function of F508del-CFTR but also normalizes calcium homeostasis in our cellular models. Finally, we identified SERCA as a potential intracellular target for tezacaftor."

MC system function is dependent on ciliary density, structure, and function and airway surface liquid (ASL) composition and hydration. Animal and human studies indicate that MC rate decreases with age which may contribute to the increased rates of pulmonary infection experienced by older people. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene encodes an anion channel on epithelial surfaces that plays a key role in maintaining ASL hydration. Failure or dysfunction of CFTR could result in the dehydration of airway mucus, depressing MC. Here we use two available databases including bulk (GTEx) and single-cell (CELLxGENE) sequencing data from the lung to determine if CFTR expression decreases with age. Bulk expression data and single-cell expression data from goblet, club, and respiratory basal cells all demonstrated patterns of decreasing CFTR expression with age. Ciliated airway cells did not. Secretory cells (including club and goblet cells) and basal cells are the largest source of CFTR expression in the airway. This indicates that changes in CFTR expression and ASL dehydration may contribute to the decreasing MC associated with aging."

Airway inflammation is ubiquitous in CF, and suppressing it has generally been considered to improve outcomes. However, the role of inflammation in people taking CFTR modulators, small-molecule drugs that restore CFTR function, is not well understood. We previously showed that inflammation enhances the efficacy of CFTR modulators. To further elucidate this relationship, we treated human \u0394F508-CF epithelia with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17, two inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in CF airways. TNF-\u03b1+IL-17 enhanced CFTR modulator-evoked anion secretion through mechanisms that raise intracellular Cl- (Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransport) and HCO3- (carbonic anhydrases and Na+/HCO3- cotransport). This enhancement required p38 MAPK signaling. Importantly, CFTR modulators did not affect CF airway surface liquid viscosity under control conditions but prevented the rise in viscosity in epithelia treated with TNF-\u03b1+IL-17. Finally, antiinflammatory drugs limited CFTR modulator responses in TNF-\u03b1+IL-17-treated epithelia. These results provide critical insights into mechanisms by which inflammation increases responses to CFTR modulators. They also suggest an equipoise between potential benefits and limitations of suppressing inflammation in people taking modulators, call into question current treatment approaches, and highlight a need for additional studies."

As one of the core factors in immune-inflammatory responses, interleukin (IL)-6 is closely related to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. It may also play an important role in OD induced by diseases, such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019. However, there is no study has reported its role in OD in AR. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of IL-6 in AR-related OD, in an attempt to discover a new target for the prevention and treatment of OD in patients with AR. METHODS: Differential expression analysis was performed using the public datasets GSE52804 and GSE140454 for AR, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by obtaining the intersection points between these two datasets. IL-6, a common differential factor, was obtained by intersecting the DEGs with the General Olfactory Sensitivity Database (GOSdb) again. A model of AR mice with OD was developed by sensitizing with ovalbumin (OVA) to verify the reliability of IL-6 as a key factor of OD in AR and explore the potential mechanisms. Furthermore, a supernatant and microglia co-culture model of nasal mucosa epithelial cells stimulated by the allergen house dust mite extract Derp1 was established to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms of IL-6-mediated OD in AR. RESULTS: The level of IL-6 in the nasal mucosa and olfactory bulb of AR mice with OD significantly increased and showed a positive correlation with the expression of olfactory bulb microglia marker Iba-1 and the severity of OD. In-vitro experiments showed that the level of IL-6 significantly increased in the supernatant after the nasal mucosa epithelial cells were stimulated by Derp1, along with significantly decreased barrier function of the nasal mucosa. The expression levels of neuroinflammatory markers IL-1\u03b2 and INOS increased after a conditioned culture of microglia with the supernatant including IL-6. Then knockdown (KD) of IL-6R by small interfering RNA (siRNA), the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and INOS significantly diminished. CONCLUSION: IL-6 plays a key role in the occurrence and development of OD in AR, which may be related to its effect on olfactory bulb microglia-mediated neuroinflammation."

This study aimed to explore the relationship between OD and damage of the olfactory bulb (OB) in allergic rhinitis (AR). The therapeutic potential of TAK-242, a selective TLR4 inhibitor, was evaluated for OD. METHOD: An AR mouse model was established with ovalbumin (OVA) to test the olfactory function of AR mice using the buried food pellet test (BFPT). Mice with OD were intraperitoneally injected with TAK-242 or 1% DMSO (vehicle). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect microglia and astrocyte activation in the OB. TUNNEL staining was performed to detect apoptosis in the OB. Proteins in the TLR4 signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. The level of proinflammatory factor mRNA in the OB was determined by RT-PCR. RESULT: Neuroinflammation was observed in the OB of the OD group, as evidenced by glial cell activation and increased proinflammatory factor expression. The number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the OB of the OD group. The expression of TLR4, MyD88, and p-NF-\u03baBp65 was significantly up-regulated in the OB of the OD group. TAK-242 treatment significantly reduced the level of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression, as well as activation of microglia and astrocytes in the OB tissues. CONCLUSION: TAK-242 improve olfactory function in AR mice mainly by reducing neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the OB, which may be related to blocking the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway."

                "abstract": "The pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (AR)-related olfactory dysfunction (OD) remains unknown. Inhibiting microglial response in olfactory bulb (OB) can ameliorate AR-related OD, but no precise targets have been available. In this study, we established a mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR and combined with the application of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R)-specific antagonists and cell culture in conditioned medium to investigate the role and mechanism of OB microglial P2X7R in AR-related OD. Serum IgE and IL-5 levels determined via ELISA and federated the number of nose-scratching to affirm the success of OVA-induced AR mouse model. Buried food pellet test was used to evaluate the olfactory function of mice. The changes of IBA1, GFAP, P2X7R, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1Ra, and CASPASE 1 were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were determined by the commercialized kit. The morphological changes of microglia were assessed using immunofluorescence staining and Sholl analysis. Findings showed that AR-related OD was associated with OB microglia-mediated imbalance between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1Ra. Treatment with BBG improved the olfactory function in AR mice with restoring the balance between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1Ra. In vitro, the conditioned medium obtained after HNEpC treatment with Der p1 could activate HMC3 to arise inflammatory reaction basing on \"ATP-P2X7R-Caspase 1\" axis, while inhibition of its P2X7R suppressed the reaction. In brief, microglial P2X7R in OB is a direct effector molecule in AR-related OD and inhibition of it may be a new strategy for the treatment of AR-related OD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shufeng Jiedu capsule (SFJDC) has been widely used as a conventional Chinese pharmaceutical agent for various upper respiratory infections, including acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and allergic rhinitis (AR). However, its mechanism in AR remains unclear. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to decipher the antiallergic inflammatory effect of SFJDC in an AR model with olfactory dysfunction. Specifically, we wanted to explore whether SFJDC can improve the olfactory abnormality in AR mice and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and olfactory bulb (OB). METHODS: To address the above issues, we constructed an AR model using C57BL/6 mice, which were sensitised and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) by intraperitoneal injection. SFJDC (0.045 or 0.18 g/kg) was delivered by gavage administration 1 h prior to the intraperitoneal injection of OVA. The control mice received saline alone. Then, the animals were assessed according to the presence of nasal symptoms and nasal inflammation, and a buried food test was used to evaluate olfactory function. The levels of proteins involved in the AMPK/mTOR autophagy pathway in the OE and OB were investigated by western blotting and fluorescence staining. RESULTS: After OVA induction of AR and drug administration, we found that SFJDC significantly ameliorated the nasal symptoms and allergic inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa superior to cetirizine. A behavioural test indicated that the mice with AR had olfactory dysfunction, and SFJDC can ameliorate this behavior deficiency. Meanwhile, SFJDC clearly reduced the neuroinflammation level in OE tissue. In addition, SFJDC increased p-mTOR and decreased p-AMPK, beclin1, LC3 and cleaved caspase-3 levels in the OE. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to antibacterial and antiviral activities, SFJDC has marked anti-inflammatory effects in AR mice. Its mechanism of action in the nasal cavity involves inhibition of upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, modulation of autophagy and apoptosis levels and regulation of autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway in the OE tissue of AR mice. Hence, SFJDC is a promising drug for AR, and clinical trials should further validate the therapeutic impact of SFJDC on AR with olfactory dysfunction."

                "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the role and mechanism of the olfactory bulb (OB) microglial P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in allergic rhinitis (AR)-related depression, with the objective of identifying a potential clinical target. An AR mouse model was induced using ovalbumin (OVA), while chronic stress was employed to induce depression. The study used P2X7R-specific antagonists and OB microglia-specific P2X7R knockdown mice as crucial tools. The results showed that mice in the OVA + stress group exhibited more pronounced depressive-like phenotypes. Furthermore, there was an observed increase in microglial activation in the OB, followed by a rise in the level of inflammation. The pharmacological inhibition of P2X7R significantly mitigated the depression-like phenotype and the OB inflammatory response in OVA + stress mice. Notably, the specific knockdown of microglial P2X7R in the OB resulted in a similar effect, possibly linked to the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 via the \"ATP-P2X7R-Caspase 1\" axis. These findings collectively demonstrate that microglial P2X7R in the OB acts as a direct effector molecule in AR-related depression, and its inhibition may offer a novel strategy for clinical prevention and treatment."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaoqinglong decoction (XQLD), first recorded in Shang Han Lun, is a traditional Chinese medicine prescribed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). XQLD alleviates the clinical symptoms of AR by inhibiting the occurrence of an inflammatory response, but the specific regulatory mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis is closely related to AR pathogenesis. Hence, this study aimed to explore the potential role of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis pathway in the AR-associated pharmacological mechanism of XQLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/C mice models of AR was established by using ovalbumin (OVA) and aluminum hydroxide sensitization. After intragastric administration of different dosages of XQLD, nasal allergic symptoms were observed. The expression of OVA-sIgE and Th2 inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in serum was detected by ELISA. The histopathological morphology and expression of inflammatory factors in nasal mucosa along with pyroptosis were investigated. Molecular docking was performed to analyze the binding of representative compounds of XQLD with NLRP3. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting. RESULTS: XQLD significantly improved the nasal allergic symptoms of mice, reduced the degree of goblet cell proliferation, mast cell infiltration, and collagen fiber hyperplasia in nasal mucosa. Meanwhile, it could downregulate the expression of Th2 inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in serum and nasal mucosa. XQLD significantly reduced the number of GSDMD and TUNEL double-positive cells and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 expression. Molecular docking confirmed that seven representative compounds of XQLD had good binding properties with NLRP3 and were able to inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CONCLUSIONS: The representative compounds of XQLD might inhibit pyroptosis in nasal mucosa mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome to helping the recovery of AR, which provides a new modern pharmacological proof for XQLD to treat AR."

Methods: An AR mouse model was established with ovalbumin, and the olfactory function of AR mice was detected by the buried food pellet test. Mice with OD were intraperitoneally injected with CY-09 or saline. The activation of microglia and astrocytes in olfactory bulb was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression level of pyroptosis associated protein was detected by Western blot. The level of pyroptosis associated proinflammatory factor mRNA was determined by real-time PCR. SPSS 24.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: After the test, ovalbumin successfully established AR mice model, in which 52.5% (21/40) of them showed OD. The number of activated microglia and astroglia in olfactory bulb tissue in OD group were more than those in non-OD group (all P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) was significantly increased in the olfactory bulb of the OD group (all P<0.05). CY-09 could significantly reduce the level of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 expression, and inhibite the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the olfactory bulb tissues (all P<0.05). Conclusion: NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis is closely related to the OD associated with AR.

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common otolaryngology disease and one of the clinical causes of olfactory dysfunction (OD). The olfactory bulb serves as a transfer station for olfactory information transmission, and alleviating its neuroinflammation may be expected to improve AR-induced OD. Recent studies have suggested that the dopamine D2 receptor acts as a key target in regulating immune functions and neuroinflammatory reaction. However, the effect of dopamine D2 receptor on AR-induced neuroinflammation is still unknown. METHODS: An AR mouse model with OD induced by ovalbumin were constructed. The buried food pellet test was to evaluate the olfactory function of the mice. Immunofluorescence staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting were also used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of the dopamine D2 receptor in AR-induced OD. RESULTS: We found that AR-induced OD has a relationship with inflammatory responses in the olfactory bulb. Nasal administration of quinpirole (Quin, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, 3 mg/kg) improved olfactory function in mice, inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalings and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the olfactory bulb. In vitro, Quin (20 \u03bcmol/L) inhibited the release of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signalings-dependent inflammatory cytokines in cultured microglia. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the dopamine D2 receptor inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines through TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling in the olfactory bulb microglia, and protects olfactory function."

The results of recent studies of HLA-DRB1 suggest that HLA-DRB1 plays an important role in allergic disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the H2-Eb1 (orthologous gene of human HLA-DRB1 in mice) gene and AR pathogenesis in AR mice. METHODS: Female 129/sv mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) to establish an AR mouse model. After successful induction, the nasal mucosa was fixed and stained for pathologic analysis, such as eosinophil (EOS) evaluation and mast cell infiltration etc. The Th1 and Th2 cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and the OVA-specific IgE levels were detected using the ELISA method. The H2-Eb1 and GATA-3 (GATA-binding protein-3) and T-bet (T-box expressed in T-cells) protein expression in the nasal mucosa were detected by the western blot or immune-histochemistry, immunofluorescence technique. The expression of H2-Eb1 mRNA in nasal mucosa was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the cilia layer in nasal mucosa of the experimental group was found to be partially desquamated; eosinophil (EOS) and mast cell infiltration was found in submucosal layer; serum OVA-IgE and IL-4, IL-10 levels were found to be significantly increased, together with a decrease of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 levels. The expression of H2-Eb1 mRNA and H2-Eb1 protein, as well as the ratio of GATA-3/T-bet expression, were upregulated in the nasal mucosa of the experimental group as compared to controls. CONCLUSION: H2-Eb1 expression, accompanied by an increased GATA-3/T-bet ratio were significantly upregulated in the nasal mucosa of our successfully established AR mouse model, suggesting that HLA-DRB1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AR and in Th1/Th2 balance regulation."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common immune disease of the nasal mucosa characterized with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic inflammation after exposure to allergens in susceptible population. Previous reports have demonstrated that the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could reduce allergic inflammation. However, there is little knowledge about whether the culture supernatant of BMSCs (conditioned medium, CM) has similar anti- inflammatory potential in treating AR. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the immunoregulatory effects of conditioned medium derived from BMSCs (BMSC-CM) on allergic inflammation in an AR mouse model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The AR murine model was induced by repeated sensitization and challenges with ovalbumin (OVA). Subsequently the allergic symptoms of AR mice, cytokine levels, the histopathological features of the nasal mucosa and T helper 1 (Th1) : T helper 2 (Th2) cells ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with BMSC-CM was found as effective as BMSCs in reducing allergic symptoms and inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration in the nasal mucosa. After BMSC-CM or BMSCs administration, the OVA-specific IgE and interleukin 4 levels in serum decreased and interferon gamma level increased compared with AR mice treated with uncultured fresh medium. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in Th1:Th2 cells ratio after OVA-sensitization and the ratio was reversed by BMSC-CM and BMSCs treatments. Furthermore, the data revealed that BMSC-CM suppressed the production of signal transduction and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) at messenger RNA and protein levels in the nasal mucosa. CONCLUSION: BMSC-CM could ameliorate allergic inflammation and regulate the balance of Th cells, and the underlying mechanism was closely related to STAT6 signaling pathway. The immunoregulatory effects of BMSCs could be achieved through paracrine function, and nasal dripping of BMSC-CM might be a novel approach for the treatment of AR."

Animal studies have shown that NP aggravates ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR); however, the exact mechanism underlying its action has not yet been detailed. This study aimed to explore the aggravation of the AR inflammatory response following NP exposure and its possible mechanism. The AR mouse model was constructed using OVA. Under NP exposure, allergic nasal symptoms were observed, eosinophil infiltration was assessed by Sirius red staining, and the levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in nasal mucosa samples were detected using cytometric bead array. The mRNA levels of OX40/OX40L and GATA3 in nasal mucosa were detected by qPCR, and the expression levels of the TSLP and JAK1/2-STAT3 signaling pathway components were also identified. Our results suggest that NP exposure exacerbated allergic nasal symptoms and that eosinophils accumulated in nasal mucosa after OVA challenge. The levels of the typical T helper 2 cytokines, as well as the mRNA levels of OX40/OX40L and GATA3, were elevated in the nasal mucosa of OVA-challenged mice exposed to NP. In addition, NP exposure elevated the TSLP, TSLPR, IL-7R, p-JAK1, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 levels in the nasal mucosa after OVA stimulation. Overall, the present study suggests NP can exacerbate OVA-induced AR inflammatory responses; furthermore, this aggravating effect of NP may be related to the TSLP-TSLPR/IL-7R and JAK1/2-STAT3 signaling pathways."

Methods: AR mouse model was established by using ovalbumin (OVA), and the mice were divided into two groups: olfactory dysfunction (OD) group and without OD group through buried food pellet test (BFPT). The OD mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, and OVA combined with dopamine (3, 6, 9 and 12 days, respectively) or OVA combined with an equal amount of PBS (the same treatment time) was administered nasally. The olfactory function of mice was evaluated by BFPT. The number of eosinophils and goblet cells in the nasal mucosa were detected by HE and PAS staining. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression of olfactory marker protein (OMP) in olfactory epithelium, the important rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) of dopamine, and the marker proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD11b of glial cell in the olfactory bulb. TUNEL staining was used to detect the damage of the olfactory bulb. SPSS 26.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: AR mice with OD had AR pathological characteristics. Compared with AR mice without OD, the expression of OMP in olfactory epithelium of AR mice with OD was reduced (F=26.09, P<0.05), the expression of GFAP and CD11b in the olfactory bulb was increased (F value was 38.95 and 71.71, respectively, both P<0.05), and the expression of TH in the olfactory bulb was decreased (F=77.00, P<0.05). Nasal administration of dopamine could shorten the time of food globule detection in mice to a certain extent, down-regulate the expression of GFAP and CD11b in the olfactory bulb (F value was 6.55 and 46.11, respectively, both P<0.05), and reduce the number of apoptotic cells in the olfactory bulb (F=25.64, P<0.05). But dopamine had no significant effect on the number of eosinophils and goblet cells in nasal mucosa (F value was 36.26 and 19.38, respectively, both P>0.05), and had no significant effect on the expression of OMP in the olfactory epithelium (F=55.27, P>0.05). Conclusion: Dopamine can improve olfactory function in mice with AR to a certain extent, possibly because of inhibiting the activation of glial cells in olfactory bulb and reducing the apoptotic injury of olfactory bulb cells."

Although previous studies have shown that PRMT1 contributes to the severity of allergic airway inflammation or asthma, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the role of PRMT1 and its relevant mechanism in the development of allergic rhinitis (AR). METHODS: The expression levels of PRMTs and cytokines were determined by RT-PCR, and the localization of PRMT1 was determined by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The levels of house dust mite (HDM)-specific immunoglobulins in serum and of cytokines in nasal lavage fluids were determined by ELISA. PRMT1 inhibition was achieved by siRNA and\u00a0treatment with the pan PRMT inhibitor arginine N-methyltransferase\u00a0inhibitor-1. RESULTS: PRMT1 expression was significantly increased in the nasal mucosa of patients and mice with AR. The degree of eosinophilic infiltration in the nasal mucosa was reduced in PRMT1+/- AR mice compared with wild-type mice. PRMT1 haploinsufficiency reduced the levels of HDM-specific immunoglobulins in serum and those of TH2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and epithelial (thymic stromal lymphopoietin [TSLP], IL-25, and IL-33) cytokines in the nasal lavage fluids of AR mice. In nasal epithelial cells, HDM and IL-4 cooperate to enhance PRMT1 expression through a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway. In addition, PRMT1 was essential for the production of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in response to HDM and IL-4. Arginine N-methyltransferase inhibitor-1 treatment alleviated AR in the mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: PRMT1 plays an important role in AR development by regulating epithelial-derived cytokine production and might be a new therapeutic target for AR."

However, the mechanisms responsible for AR-induced olfactory loss are still largely unknown. Because of the difficulty to obtain human olfactory mucosa, an AR-induced olfactory loss animal model needs to be constructed to clarify the mechanism. The AR mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal sensitizing with ovalbumin (OVA) followed by intranasal challenge lasted from 1 to 12 weeks. For groups with recovery, mice were housed for another 4-week long without any treatment after the last intranasal challenge. Olfactory function, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) density and leukocytes infiltration were examined at different time points. Olfactory loss occurs immediately after 1-week intranasal challenge and deteriorates almost to anosmia after 8th week, and after that olfactory loss become irreversible. Nasal inflammation induces significant infiltration of leukocytes into olfactory epithelium (OE), which negatively correlated with the density of ORNs and mouse olfaction in a time dependent manner. The neutrophilic subtype dominates in number amongst the total infiltrated leukocytes, indicating its pivotal role in nasal inflammation-induced olfactory dysfunction. In this study, we constructed a persistent AR-induced olfactory loss mouse model, losing the ability to recover from dysfunction if the disease duration more than eight weeks, which implies that timely treatments are necessary. Meanwhile, this mouse model could provide an easy and reliable system to clarify the mechanisms of AR-induced irreversible olfactory dysfunction."

In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of saikosaponin A (SSA) on nasal inflammation, T helper (Th)2 and Th17 cytokines, retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR)-\u03b3t, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signalings in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR mice model. OVA-induced AR mice exhibited increase in nasal symptoms, histological alteration, OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E/IgG1, ROR-\u03b3t, STAT3 and NF-\u03baB signalings. However, the administration of SSA significantly decreased allergic symptoms including nasal rubbing and sneezing. Additionally, histological alterations such as mucosa layer thickness, goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophils and mast cell infiltration in nasal tissues dramatically improved by treatment with SSA. Also, SSA treatment decreased the levels of OVA-specific IgE/IgG1 in serum and the levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 in nasal lavage fluid (NALF). Moreover, SSA inhibited the activation of transcription factor ROR-\u03b3t, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in both NALF and lung. Futher, SSA could also significantly inhibit the expressions of NF-\u03baB p65 and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 in NALF and lung. These present results suggested that SSA may attenuate OVA-induced allergic rhinitis through regulating the expression of IL-6/ROR-\u03b3t/STAT3/IL-17/NF-\u03baB signaling. The results indicate that SSA may be used as a therapeutic candidate for allergic rhinitis disease."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: CD4+ T cells play an important role not only in the induction of allergy but also in allergic inflammation. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) also mediate type 2 immune responses in allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the relationships between CD4+ T cells and ILC2s in allergic condition are currently not well defined. The study aimed to evaluate the potential influences of CD4+ T cells on ILC2s in the murine model of AR. METHODS: A murine model of AR was established using ovalbumin (OVA), and OVA-induced ILC2s were sorted and purified from the mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and cultured in vitro. Then, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) on ILC2s was examined. CD4+ T cells were separated from AR mice peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). After that, productions of IL-5 and IL-13 on ILC2s cultures were assessed when CD4+ T cells or plus anti-MHCII antibody or anti-CD4 antibody were administered into the cultures. Finally, we adoptively transferred ILC2s alone or ILC2s plus anti-MHCII antibody to the murine model of AR to investigate their roles in the nasal allergic inflammation. RESULTS: We showed that ILC2s could be induced by OVA in the mouse NALT. The number and percentage of ILC2s in AR mice were increased. MHCII was expressed on ILC2s, and its protein and mRNA were all enhanced in allergic condition. IL-5 and IL-13 proteins and mRNAs were elevated after CD4+ T cells administration, and were reduced after these cells plus anti-MHCII antibody or anti-CD4 antibody application. Numbers of sneezing and nasal rubbing as well as counts of eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) were all enhanced after the adoptive transfer of ILC2s when compared to AR mice. IL-5 and IL-13 in the NLF of allergic mice were also increased in comparison with AR group. However, above parameters were all decreased after the transfer of ILC2s plus anti-MHCII antibody versus AR mice or ILC2s-treated ones. CONCLUSION: These findings show that CD4+ T cells induce productions of IL-5 and IL-13 through MHCII on ILC2s in AR mice models."

                "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a complex IgE-mediated nasal allergic and inflammatory disease. Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) is essential in the process of allergic and inflammatory responses. MCC950 is a selective NLRP3 inhibitor. However, its role and mechanism in AR remains undetermined. The present study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of MCC950 on an ovalbumin (OVA) induced mouse model of AR. The AR BALB/c mice were constructed using OVA and administrated intranasally with MCC950. Concentrations of OVA-specific IgE, histamines and leukotrienes C4 (LTC4) in serum, and OVA-specific IgE, ECP, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Inflammatory cells were counted in NLF. HE and PAS staing were used for evaluating eosinophils and goblet cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were employed to evaluate immunolabeling of NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in nasal mucosas of mice. Real-time PCR was conducted to assay NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 mRNA levels. In vitro studies, western blotting, real-time PCR and ELISA were performed to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of OVA and NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 on spleen mononuclear cells. We found significant downregulation of sneezing, nasal rubbing, inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cells and NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 expression in MCC950 treated mice compared with untreated AR mice. In spleen mononuclear cells culture and stimulation experiment, NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 levels were upregulated by OVA but inhibited by MCC950. In conclusion, MCC950 could effectively exert its ameliorative effect in murine AR by inhibiting NLRP3 and leads to reduction of Caspase-1, ASC, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, resulting in the attenuation of the allergic and inflammatory responses."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis is high, making it a relatively common chronic condition. Countless patients suffer from seasonal Allergic rhinitis (AR). The objective of this investigation is to examine the potential involvement of common pollen allergens in seasonal allergic rhinitis, and study the proposed mechanism of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway in the induction of AR. METHOD: A mouse AR model (sensitized group) was constructed with pollen extracts and ovalbumin\u00a0(OVA) of Artemisia annua (An), Artemisia argyi (Ar) and Artemisia Sieversiana (Si), and thereafter, AR symptom score was performed. After successful modeling, mouse serum and nasal mucosa tissues were extracted for subsequent experiments. The expression levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in serum were detected using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining methods were used to observe the pathological changes of the nasal mucosal tissue; Utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 in mouse nasal mucosa were quantified; The mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 in nasal mucosa of sensitized mice were detected with Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot. Finally, the in vitro culture of Human nasal mucosal epithelial cells (HNEpC) cells was conducted, and cells were treated with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/ml Artemisia annua pollen extract\u00a0and OVA for 24\u00a0h. Western Blot assay was used to detect the expression level of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 proteins before and after HNEpC cells were treated with MyD88 inhibitor ST-2825. RESULT: On the second day after AR stimulation, the mice showed obvious AR symptoms. H&E results showed that compared to the control group, the nasal mucosal tissue in the sensitized group was significantly more inflamed. Furthermore, ELISA assay showed increased expression levels of IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-\u03b1 in serum of mice induced by OVA and Artemisia annua pollen, Artemisia argyi pollen and Artemisia Sieversiana pollen than those of the control group. However, the expression level of IL-2 was lower than that of the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Using Immunohistochemistry staining visually observed the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 in mouse nasal mucosa tissues and quantitatively analyzed. The expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 in the sensitized group were higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The results from qRT-PCR and Western Blot showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 in nasal mucosa of the sensitized group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Finally, HNEpC cells were cultured in vitro and analyzed using Western Blot. The expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 in OVA and An groups were significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05). After ST-2825 treatment, TLR4 protein expression was significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 protein expression were significantly decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: To sum up, the occurrence and development of AR induced by OVA and pollen of Artemisia annua, Artemisia argyi and Artemisia Sieversiana were related to TLR4/MyD88 signal pathway."

                "abstract": "Increasing studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of various diseases, including allergic lower airway inflammation such as asthma. To investigate the role of Rg3 in allergic upper airway disease, the effect and therapeutic mechanism of Rg3 in allergic rhinitis (AR) were studied. Ovalbumin-induced AR model mice were intragastrically administered with Rg3. Nasal symptoms, levels of IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, SOD and MDA in serum, and histopathological analysis of nasal mucosa were used to evaluate the effect of Rg3 on ameliorating AR in mice. Moreover, nasal mucosa samples from the normal control group, AR model group and high dosage of Rg3 were collected to perform omics analysis. The differentially expressed genes and significantly changed metabolites were screened based on transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, respectively. Integrative analysis was further performed to confirm the hub genes, metabolites and pathways. After Rg3 intervention, the nasal symptoms and inflammatory infiltration were effectively improved, the levels of IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and MDA were significantly reduced, and the level of SOD was obviously increased. The results of the qRT-PCR assay complemented the transcriptomic findings. Integrated analysis showed that Rg3 played an anti-AR role mainly by regulating the interaction network, which was constructed by 12 genes, 8 metabolites and 4 pathways. Our findings suggested that Rg3 had a therapeutic effect on ovalbumin-induced AR in mice by inhibiting inflammation development and reducing oxidative stress. The present study could provide a potential natural agent for the treatment of AR."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) causes an increase in oxidative stress that leads to deterioration in auditory functions. Astaxanthine (AST) is known to have strong antioxidant effects. In this study, the aim is to investigate the effect of AST against hearing loss that is due to DM. METHODS: This study is an experimental animal study. The study was designed in four groups with 8 animals (n\u2009=\u20098) in each group. The groups were as follows; Control Group (CNT), Diabetic Group (DM), AST applied diabetic group (DM+AST), and AST applied non-diabetic group (AST). Streptozotocin was applied in rats to induce DM. AST was administered by oral gavage. Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) tests were performed on several days of the study. At the end of the study, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were analyzed in cochlear tissue samples, and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. RESULTS: When the findings obtained in the ABR and DPOAE tests in the DM group, it was observed that there was a significant deterioration in the hearing sense. This deterioration was not observed in the DM+AST group. In the DM group, GPx, SOD and CAT levels decreased and MDA levels increased in blood and cochlear tissue. Compared to the DM group, it was noted that antioxidant enzyme levels increased and MDA levels decreased in the DM+AST group. Cochlear tissue pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, which increased with DM, were significantly decreased in the DM+AST group. CONCLUSION: Even though the effects of AST were investigated in a diabetic experimental animal model, if this molecule is proven to be effective in diabetic humans, it can be considered an adjunct therapeutic option with its antioxidant effects. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: The level of evidence of this article is 5. This article is an experimental animal and laboratory study."

                "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) causes ototoxicity by inducing oxidative stress, microangiopathy, and apoptosis in the cochlear sensory hair cells. The natural anti-oxidant pterostilbene (PTS) (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystylbene) has been reported to relieve oxidative stress and apoptosis in DM, but its role in diabetic-induced ototoxicity is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dose-dependent PTS on the cochlear cells of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The study included 30 albino male Wistar rats that were randomized into five groups: non-diabetic control (Control), diabetic control (DM), and diabetic rats treated with intraperitoneal PTS at 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day during the four-week experimental period (DM + PTS10, DM + PTS20, and DM + PTS40). Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests were performed at the beginning and end of the study. At the end of the experimental period, apoptosis in the rat cochlea was investigated using caspase-8, cytochrome-c, and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of the following genes: CASP-3, BCL-associated X protein (BAX), and BCL-2. Body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the rat groups were evaluated. The mean DPOAE amplitude in the DM group was significantly lower than the means of the other groups (0.9-8 kHz; P < 0.001 for all). A dose-dependent increase of the mean DPOAE amplitudes was observed with PTS treatment (P < 0.05 for all). The Caspase-8 and Cytochrome-c protein expressions and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hair cells of the Corti organs of the DM rat group were significantly higher than those of the PTS treatment and control groups (DM > DM + PTS10 > DM + PTS20 > DM + PTS40 > Control; P < 0.05 for all). PTS treatment also reduced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the mRNA expression of the anti-apoptosis BCL2 gene and by decreasing the mRNA expressions of both the pro-apoptosis BAX gene and its effector CASP-3 and the ratio of BAX/BCL-2 in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 compared to DM for all). PTS treatment significantly improved the metabolic parameters of the diabetic rats, such as body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and MDA levels, consistent with our other findings (P < 0.05 compared to DM for all). PTS decreased the cochlear damage caused by diabetes, as confirmed by DPOAE, biochemical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings. This study reports the first in vivo findings to suggest that PTS may be a protective therapeutic agent against diabetes-induced ototoxicity."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of astaxanthin on metabolic cataract in rats with type 1 diabetes and its antioxidant capacity to lens. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08): control group, diabetes mellitus (DM) group, low-dose astaxanthin (DM\u00a0+\u00a0AL) and low-dose astaxanthin (DM\u00a0+\u00a0AH) group. A rat model of type I diabetes mellitus was established by intraperitoneal injection of 60\u00a0mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). After successful modeling, rats in the administration group were given different doses of astaxanthin (AST) for 12\u00a0weeks. The lens opacity of rats was observed by slit-lamp camera system. The double antibody sandwich method was used to detect the levels of advanced glycation end product (AGE), lipid peroxide/malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in the lens. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to examine the morphologic changes in the lens. RESULTS: The severity of cataract in the lens was obviously increased after induced by STZ, whereas it was significantly decreased after treatment with AST (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, respectively). In addition, in the AST groups, the levels of AGE and MDA in the lens tissue were notably decreased when compared with those in the DM group (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, respectively). However, the levels of GSH, SOD, and CAT were increased in the AST group in comparison with those in the DM group (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Astaxanthin may play an antioxidant role in the lens. Additionally, it exerts a protective function in the lens by delaying the development and progression of metabolic cataract and inhibiting the oxidative stress of lens in diabetic rats."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects many patients all over the world. It involves different parts of the body, such as brain, eyes, kidneys, vessels, and so on. The lack of balance between free radicals and antioxidants is a possible mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Antioxidant treatment, especially natural forms, can be a beneficial solution. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of Pistacia atlantica oleoresin (PAO) on oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzymes expression in diabetic rats. METHOD: Fifty adult male Wistar rats were allotted randomly into five groups as follow: control group, diabetic control group, glibenclamide control group, diabetic glibenclamide group, diabetic treated group with 200\u2009mg/kg PAO. Then PAO was prepared and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). LD50 was also estimated for essential oil. Oxidative stress markers and antioxidant enzyme including malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also measured. The expression of GPx, CAT, and SOD genes was investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The main constituents of essential oil gum were beta-pinene (29.38%), followed by alpha-pinene (18.15%), myrcene (7.36%), trans-pinocarveol (7.15%), and camphene (4.12%). Diabetes induced an increased level of MDA (69.92\u2009\u00b1\u20093.92 vs. 43.76\u2009\u00b1\u20093.73) and decreased levels of GSH (2.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40 vs. 7.05\u2009\u00b1\u20091.59), GPx (11.66\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 vs. 16.38\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1), CAT (12.17\u2009\u00b1\u20093.38 vs. 18.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.66), and SOD (0.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67 vs. 2.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.46). In contrast, PAO treatment significantly decreased MDA (54.59\u2009\u00b1\u200912.54 vs. 69.92\u2009\u00b1\u20093.92) and increased GSH (4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.89 vs. 2.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40), GPx (25.86\u2009\u00b1\u20095.37 vs. 11.66\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2), CAT (22.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36 vs. 12.17\u2009\u00b1\u20093.38), and SOD (3.65\u2009\u00b1\u20091.08 vs. 0.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, our results indicated that both GPx and CAT mRNA levels significantly increased approximately 4.46 and 6.23 times in rats fed with 200\u2009mg/kg of PAO, more than that of the healthy control group, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Also, the average expression level of SOD was also significantly 1.57 higher in rats fed with 200\u2009mg/kg of PAO in comparison to the diabetic control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that PAO could be propose as an agent that protects the body against diseases that are associated with oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "Astaxanthin (AST) is an oxygenated derivative of carotenoid, which possesses a strong antioxidant activity. AST can effectively remove active oxygen from the body, and is thus considered to have an important role in disease prevention and treatment. The present study aimed to determine the effects of AST on type 2 diabetic\u2011associated cognitive decline (DACD) in rats. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ), in order to establish a model of diabetes mellitus (DM). A total of 40 rats were randomly divided into five groups: The control group, the DM group, the AST (50 mg/kg) group, the AST (100 mg/kg) group, and the AST+LY294002 group (AST, 50 mg/kg and LY, 0.25 \u00b5g/100 g). Following a 14\u2011day treatment with AST, the body weight, blood glucose levels and cognitive function were determined. In addition, the protein expression levels of phosphatidylinositol 3\u2011kinase (PI3K)/Akt, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione and malondialdehyde content, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), caspase\u20113 and caspase\u20119 activity were detected in the rats with DM. AST clearly augmented body weight and reduced blood glucose levels in rats with DM. Furthermore, treatment with AST significantly improved the cognitive function of rats with DM. Treatment with AST activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, and suppressed oxidative stress in the DM rats. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the rats with DM, the activities of iNOS, caspase\u20113 and caspase\u20119 were markedly reduced. Furthermore, treatment with the Akt inhibitor LY294002 reduced the effectiveness of AST on DACD in rats. In conclusion, AST may reduce type 2 DACD in rats via activation of PI3K/Akt and attenuation of oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are claimed to be under oxidative stress because of prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia, the influence of glycemic control and cardiovascular complication in diabetes on oxidative stress parameters has not been fully studied. The present study aimed to investigate lipid peroxidation end product (malondialdehyde, MDA) and antioxidant enzymes in fairly controlled type 2 DM (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] < or = 180 mg/dl) or type 2 DM complicated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and poorly controlled type 2 DM (FPG > 180 mg/dl) in comparison to a normal healthy group (FPG < 110 mg/dl). MATERIAL AND METHOD: MDA and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were determined in the red cell of 19 subjects with poorly controlled type 2 DM, 26 subjects with fairly controlled type 2 DM and 20 subjects with type 2 DM complicated with CHD who were matched for age and gender. Twenty healthy subjects with normal plasma glucose level and matched for age and gender were served as a control group. In all groups of DM these oxidative stress parameters were compared to a control group by one-way ANOVA test. Pearson rank correlation coefficient was used to compare the relationship between FPG and oxidative stress status in type 2 DM and normal controls. RESULTS: The red cell MDA levels were significantly higher in all types of diabetes compared to age-matched normal controls. The mean of red cell MDA level was highest in type 2 DM complicated with CHD. Red cell antioxidant enzyme activities were also significantly increased except for SOD and GPx activities in fairly controlled type 2 DM. The significant positive correlation between oxidative stress status (as MDA and CAT) and FPG was found in poorly controlled type 2 DM and type 2 DM complicated with CHD whereas in fairly controlled type 2 DM the significant positive correlation between CAT and FPG was only observed. CONCLUSION: These findings strongly confirmed the evidence that diabetic patients were susceptible to oxidative stress and higher blood glucose level had an association with free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. The highest level of MDA in type 2 DM complicated with CHD suggested that oxidative stress played an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complication. The results also showed the increase in antioxidant enzymes. These could probably be due to adaptive response to pro-oxidant in diabetic state. Hence, there seems to be imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems in type 2 diabetic patients."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cisplatin is employed for chemotherapeutic purposes in several types of adult and pediatric cancer. However, side-effects including nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, gastrointestinal effects and neuropathy restrict the use of the drug due to their adverse impacts on quality of life. This study aimed to determine whether levosimendan exhibits a protective effect against cisplatin-related ototoxicity in a rat model by means of functional, biochemical and histochemical analysis. METHODS: The study was employed with 24 female Sprague Dawley rats. After distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) tests applied to all rats, rats were randomly assigned into four groups of six animals each. A single intraperitoneal 15\u00a0mg/kg dose of cisplatin was administered to Cisplatin group. Levosimendan group received intraperitoneal levosimendan at a dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg for five consecutive days. Cisplatin\u00a0+\u00a0Levosimendan group received intraperitoneal levosimendan at a dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg for five consecutive days and a single intraperitoneal dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg cisplatin at 3rd day of the study. Control group received 8\u00a0mL/kg/day intraperitoneal saline solution for five consecutive days. The DPOAE test was repeated on the 6th day of the study. All rats were then sacrificed, the cochleas were removed and set aside for biochemical and histopathological analyses. RESULTS: A significant increase in levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and significantly lower activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were observed at rats of cisplatin group. Administration of levosimendan showed significantly lower cochlear MDA levels, while SOD and GPx activities both increased significantly. The DPOAE test performed at 6th day of the study showed a significant impairment in the signal-noise ratio (SNR) levels of rats in Cisplatin group. The SNR levels of rats treated with levosimendan were significantly higher than those of cisplatin group and were similar to those of the control group. Cisplatin impaired the cochlear structure and a severe Caspase 3 and 8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) immunopositivity was observed at cochlea of the rats of cisplatin group. Administration of levosimendan protected the structure of cochlea and there was a mild Caspase 3 and 8OHdG immunopositivity. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that levosimendan protects hearing against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and obviates cellular degeneration. It also significantly reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis, probable mechanisms involved in ototoxicity."

                "abstract": "The aims of the present study were to investigate in diabetic rats: (1) the chronological changes of compromised medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB) activity and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and (2) the effect of insulin on diabetes-related hearing dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (C), diabetes with insulin injection (DI), and diabetes without insulin injection (DM). Click-evoked ABR, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and the contralateral suppression (CS) of DPOAE were measured for all animals monthly. Throughout the experiment, the thresholds of click-evoked ABR did not differ among groups. Wave III was delayed and interpeak latency I-III was prolonged in the DM group at the age of 29 weeks (p < 0.05). The amplitudes of the CS of DPOAE were markedly decreased after the 25th week in the DM group, but not in the C and DI groups. Compared to the C group, the CS in the DI group was not attenuated at any frequency. Dysfunction of auditory efferent olivocochlear activity developed in diabetic rats presenting no evidence of hearing loss. The finding of a significant decrease of the CS of DPOAE could be used as an earlier indicator of diabetes-related hearing impairment than changes of ABRs. The time course of compromised MOCB is positively correlated with the duration of diabetes. Insulin could therefore protect against compromised MOCB."

(H. scabrum L.) has a protective and therapeutic effect on the wound in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: In the study, 63 Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250-300\u2009g were divided into nine groups, each with seven rats (major groups: control group, diabetes group, and treatment group). For diabetes and treatment groups, streptozotocin (STZ) was given in a single dose of 60\u2009mg/kg/i.p. In 7\u2009days, the animals with diabetes (blood glucose level > 250\u2009mg/dL) will be assigned to wound groups. All of the rats had circular full-thickness incisions in their dorsal skin caused by a 5\u2009mm punch biopsy tool. The rats were slaughtered, blood was obtained, and their forwound tissues were dissected on the 3rd, 10th, and 14th post-wounding days. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), as well as the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in plasma and wound tissues, were all measured. RESULTS: While GSH level, GPx, SOD, and CAT activities were decreased in the plasma and wound tissues, MDA level increased in the diabetic group as compared to the control group. When compared to the diabetes group, GSH level, GPx, SOD, and CAT activities were increased in the H. scabrum L. essential oil treatments, but MDA levels were decreased. In comparison to the other groups, the wounds in the H. scabrum L. essential oil diabetic groups healed better and faster. H. scabrum L. essential oil can help to reduce lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and the associated complications that come with it, as well as play a beneficial role in the treatment of diabetic wounds. CONCLUSION: Since no information was found in the literature search, future work would focus on new research examining H. scabrum L. essential oil applications to come up with new findings in determining the mechanisms of action of H. scabrum L. essential oil in diabetic wounds and preventing wound healing complications in diabetic rats."

                "abstract": "Pyranocoumarins are compounds with an important pharmacological profile, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, and hypoglycemic effects. These molecules have a widespread presence as secondary metabolites in medicinal plants used to treat Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The aim of this work was to evaluate antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the antioxidant effects of 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone (DOAcK), as well as its toxic potential. We obtained DOAcK with an enantiomeric excess of 70% by chemical synthesis. Our results showed that this compound exerts an important antidiabetic effect: blood glucose decreased in groups treated with DOAcK by 60.9% at dose of 15mg/kg (p<0.05) compared with the diabetic control group, and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain (45.7\u00b19.7 in the group treated with DOAcK vs. -23.0\u00b133.1 in the group with diabetes). In a biochemical profile, DOAcK did not modify lipid metabolism and did not cause damage at the renal level. DOAcK administration increased the activities of Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) to levels near those of the healthy group. Histopathological analysis exhibited morphology similar to that of the healthy group and the group treated with DOAcK. DOAcK is not mutagenic by Ames test for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, or TA102, and is not genotoxic by Micronucleus assay; median lethal dose (LD50) >2000mg/kg and, at this dose, no signs of toxicity or death were reported after 14days of observation. These results indicate that DOAcK can improve glucose metabolism, which may be due to the increased antioxidant activity of CAT, GPx and SOD. In addition, DOAcK is not toxic in the studies tested."

Findings indicate that obtusifolin has antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of obtusifolin against oxidative damage in diabetic hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. In this study, the rats were divided into the following groups with eight animals in each: control, untreated diabetic, three obtusifolin (10, 30, and 90 mg/kg/day)-treated diabetic groups. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) in rats. STZ was injected intraperitoneally at a single dose of 60 mg/kg for diabetes induction. Obtusifolin (intraperitoneal injection) was administered 3 days after STZ administration; these injections were continued to the end of the study (4 weeks). At the end of the 4-week period, blood was drawn for biochemical assays. In order to determine the changes of cellular antioxidant defense systems, antioxidant enzymes including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in serum. Moreover, we also measured serum nitric oxide (NO) and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, markers of lipid peroxidation. STZ-induced diabetes caused an elevation (P < 0.001) of blood glucose, MDA, NO, total lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol, with reduction of GSH level and CAT and SOD activities. The results indicated that the significant elevation in the blood glucose, MDA, NO, total lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol; also the reduction of glutathione level and CAT and SOD activity were ameliorated in the obtusifolin-treated diabetic groups compared with the untreated groups, in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001). These results suggest that obtusifolin has antioxidant properties and improves chemically induced diabetes and its complications by modulation of oxidative stress."

MAIN METHODS: AST-SAC (1\u00a0mg/kg/day) was treated against DM in rats for 45\u00a0days. The oxidative stress, antioxidants level, insulin secretion, activities of various carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes were studied. The glucose uptake in L6 myotubes was studied. In addition, in silico analysis of interaction of AST-SAC with proteins such as insulin receptor (IR) and 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were carried out. KEY FINDINGS: Administration of AST-SAC in DM rats has protected the mitochondrial function (decreased oxidative stress and normalized oxidative phosphorylation activities) and antioxidant capacity of the pancreas which has resulted in beta cells rejuvenation and insulin secretion restoration. AST-SAC decreased the alpha-glucosidases activities to bring glycemic control in DM rats. Due to these effects the glycoprotein components and lipids were restored to near normalcy in DM rats. AST-SAC protected the antioxidant status of liver, kidney and plasma; and curbed the progression of secondary complications of DM. AST-SAC treatment stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes in in vitro. To support this observation, AST-SAC interacted with proteins such as IR and AMPK in silico. SIGNIFICANCE: AST-SAC can be considered as \"multi-target-directed ligand\", that is, through these manifold effects, AST-SAC has been able to prevail over DM in rats."

                "abstract": "We aim to study the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of lycopene on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats, anticipating a complementary strategy for the prevention of long-term complications of T2DM. In this study, rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were divided into four groups, receiving a 10-week lycopene intervention: DM, DM + low dose of lycopene (L), DM + medium dose of lycopene (M), and DM + high dose of lycopene (H) group with 0, 5, 10, and 15\u00a0mg/kg BW lycopene, respectively. At the end of intervention, fasted blood glucose (FBG) level, oxidative stress indicators, including glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), glycosylated low-density lipoprotein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as antioxidants, that is, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. The results indicated that oxidative stress and inflammatory factors were elevated in DM rats. Lycopene intervention decreased the FBG level in DM rats compared with the untreated ones. It revealed a dose-dependent effect on decreasing serum oxidative stress biomarkers, including GHb, ox-LDL, and MDA. Inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1 and CRP) in DM rats were also decreased by lycopene intervention. Total antioxidative capacity as well as the activities of antioxidants in DM rats including CAT, SOD, and GPx were increased after lycopene intervention. We conclude that lycopene protects against diabetic progression and prevents further complications of diabetic rats through ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as improving the systemic antioxidative capacity. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: According to our study, lycopene intakes at experimental dosages appear to have beneficial effects on ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats, suggesting that lycopene might help improving T2DM progression when its daily intake is up to about 0.79\u00a0mg/kg BW in humans, which approximately equals to 5\u00a0mg/kg BW in rats. However, more clinical trials are needed to provide a more reliable and convincing conclusion in humans."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cisplatin (CDDP) is a widely used antineoplastic drug. However, its use is limited due to the ototoxic side effects. In this study, the effects of ethyl pyruvate (EP), known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, against CDDP ototoxicity were investigated. METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar albino rats (n:8) were used in this study. CDDP was administered i.p. as a single dose of 15\u2009mg/kg/day in order to cause ototoxicity. EP was applied i.p. at a dose of 50\u2009mg/kg/day for 7\u2009days. RESULTS: When the Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) tests carried out in the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods were examined, it was observed that the hearing functions were significantly impaired with the CDDP application, while a significant improvement was observed in the CDDP\u2009+\u2009EP group. Compared to the control group, the CDDP group had significantly higher malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and significantly lower glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels. In the CDDP\u2009+\u2009EP group, there was no deterioration in MDA, SOD and CAT levels that was observed in the CDDP group. The increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) levels caused by CDDP administration was observed to be significantly decreased in the CDDP\u2009+\u2009EP group. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing tests and biochemical results show that ethyl pyruvate is protective against cisplatin ototoxicity with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects."

                "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of treatment with antioxidant stobadine (ST) on the activities of enzymes related with pentose phosphate pathway and glutathione-dependent metabolism and the other markers of oxidative stress in brain and peripheral organs of diabetic rats, and to compare the effects of ST treatment alone with the effects of treatments with another antioxidant vitamin E and ST plus vitamin E. Rats were made diabetic by the injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 55 mg/kg IP), and, 2 days later, some control and diabetic rats were left untreated or treated with ST (24.7 mg/kg/day, orally), vitamin E (400-500 U/kg/day, orally), or both substances together. In the brain, although 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (6-PGD) did not change, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (G-6PD) was markedly increased in diabetic rats compared with controls; only combined treatment with ST and vitamin E produced a partial prevention on this alteration. The aorta G-6PD and 6-PGD of diabetic rats were 52% and 36% of control values, respectively. Neither single treatments with each antioxidant nor their combination altered the G-6PD and 6-PGD in aorta of diabetic rats. Glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activity was increased by STZ-diabetes in brain, heart, and kidney. In diabetic brain, vitamin E alone or combination with ST kept GSHPx at normal levels. Diabetes-induced stimulation in GSHPx did not decrease in response to the treatment with vitamin E in heart and kidney, but was greatly prevented by ST alone. The activity of glutathione reductase (GR) was decreased in brain and heart of diabetic rats. The treatment with each antioxidant or with a combination of both agents completely prevented this deficiency and resulted in further activation of GR in diabetic tissues. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity did not significantly change in diabetic brain and aorta. GST was stimulated by all treatment protocols in the brain of diabetic rats and was depressed in aorta of control rats. Catalase (CAT) was activated in diabetic heart but depressed in diabetic kidney. Diabetes-induced abnormalities in CAT activity did not respond to vitamin E alone in heart, was moderately ameliorated by the treatment with this vitamin in kidney, and was completely prevented by ST alone in both tissues. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of brain and heart was unchanged by the diabetes but inhibited in diabetic kidney after the treatment ST alone or ST plus vitamin E. The lipid peroxidation (MDA) was increased in diabetic brain and heart. ST or vitamin E alone partly prevented diabetes-induced increase in MDA in brain and heart; however, antioxidant combination achieved a completely amelioration in MDA of these tissues of diabetic rats. Kidney MDA levels were similar in control and untreated diabetic animals. ST and vitamin E treatments, when applied separately or together, significantly reduced kidney MDA in both control and diabetic rats; and the combined effect of antioxidants was greater than that of each alone. These results are consistent with the degenerative role of hyperglycemia on cellular reducing equivalent homeostasis and antioxidant defense, and provide further evidence that pharmacological intervention of different antioxidants may have significant implications in the prevention of the prooxidant feature of diabetes and protects redox status of the cells."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Genus Trigonella has a history of folkloric medicinal uses in China, Japan, Egypt and India. There are a variety of therapeutic actions of Trigonella including hypocholesterolemia, hypoglycemia, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory activities, antioxidants and appetite stimulant. AIM OF THE STUDY: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing annually. The present study aims at investigating the protective effects of Trigonella stellata against the adverse effects of diabetes mellitus through investigation of the changes in phase I & II drug-metabolizing enzyme activities, protein expression of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes [CYP2E1 & 3A4], oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes as well as histopathology of both liver and kidney tissues. METHODS: GC-MS and MALDI-TOF were used to analyze the main constituents of the aqueous and the ethanolic extract of Trigonella stellata. Western immunoblotting technique used to show the protein expression of CYP450 isozymes in different groups. Spectrophotometric- and fluorophotometric techniques were also used for assessment of different hepatic integrity enzymes. Histopathological techniques used to illustrate the changes in the tissues of both livers and kidneys after different treatments. RESULTS: Trigonelline was found to be the main constituent of both aqueous and ethanolic extract of Trigonella stellata. Administration of the aqueous and/or the ethanolic extracts of Trigonella stellata to the diabetic rats was found to decrease the blood glucose level, the biochemical markers of both liver (transaminases activities, Lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase) and the renal functions (urea, creatinine and bilirubin) which were increased in diabetic-treated rats relative to their normal levels. Diabetes mellitus potentially induced the oxidative stress, and also activities of dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I, cytochrome c-reductase, ethoxyresourfin O-deethylase, and the total hepatic content of cytochrome P450. On the other hand, the activity of catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione S-transferase [GST], glutathione reductase [GR], glutathione peroxidase [GPx] and levels of reduced glutathione [GSH] were potentially inhibited in diabetic rats compared to the control rats. However, treatments of diabetic rats with either aqueous and/or ethanolic extracts of Trigonella stellata restored such changes caused by diabetes almost nearly to their normal levels compared to the control group. Supporting the activity of dimethyl nitrosamine N-demethylase I activity, the protein expression of CYP2E1 was also induced in diabetic rats. However, the aqueous extract of Trigonella stellata was more effective than ethanolic extract in restoring the changes in the protein expression of CYP2E. On the other hand, the protein expression of CYP3A4 was markedly decreased in diabetic rats, and this decrease was partially restored to its normal level after treatment of diabetic rats with aqueous and/or ethanolic extracts. In addition, Trigonella stellata extracts alleviated the histopathological changes in livers and kidneys caused by diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that diabetes mellitus induced changes in oxidative stress, phase I & II drug-metabolizing enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes activities, whereas both extracts of Trigonella stellata alleviated such changes. Alterations in cytochrome P450 system should be considered when therapeutic drugs are administered to diabetic patients since most of xenobiotic are mainly metabolized by this system."

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatments are applied various diseases including diabetic patients with unhealing foot ulcers, however, and also increases the formation of ROS. Recently, it has been reported that oxidative stress worsens many pathological conditions including DM and obesity suggesting possible changes in regulation of genes associated with the oxidative stress, however, effects of HBO which could induce ROS on the gene expressions of oxidative stress parameters in DM animals are unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of HBO exposure on the gene expression of three important antioxidant enzymes, cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD), cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1), and catalase (CAT) in DM rats, respectively. We used streptozotocin-induced DM model rats and examined both mRNA expressions and the activities of these antioxidant enzymes in the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The mRNA expressions of Cu-Zn SOD and CAT decreased significantly (p < 0.001), and GPx increased significantly (p < 0.001) in all the studied organs of DM rats under HBO exposure compared to those from DM-induced rats not exposed to HBO. Similarly, activities of these three enzymes changed in accordance with the mRNA levels. These results suggested that DM induction and HBO exposure might synergistically affect antioxidant enzymes, resulting increase of oxidative stress state. Thus, HBO exposure seems to be an excellent model system for investigating oxidative stress."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important disease for kidneys and may cause nephropathy as a long term complication. The aim of this study was to investigate protective effect of melatonin, a potent antioxidant, against distant organ injury on liver induced by renal IR in rats with or without DM. The rats were divided into six groups: control (n=7), DM (n=5), IR (n=7), DM+IR (n=7), melatonin+IR (Mel+IR) (melatonin, 4 mg/ kg during 15 days) (n=7), and Mel+DM+IR groups (n=7). Diabetes developed 3 days after single i.p. dose of 45 mg/kg streptozotocin. After 15 day, the left renal artery was occluded for 30 min followed 24 h of reperfusion in IR performed groups. DM did not alter oxidative parameters alone in liver tissue. The levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and nitric oxide with activities of xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase were increased in liver tissues of diabetic and non-diabetic IR groups. Nitric oxide level in DM was higher than control. The activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were increased in IR groups in comparison with control and DM. ALT and AST levels were higher in IR and DM+IR groups than control and DM. Melatonin treatment reversed all these oxidant and antioxidant parameters to control values as well as serum liver enzymes. We concluded that renal IR may affect distant organs such as liver and oxidative stress may play role on this injury, but DM has not an effect on kidney induced distant organ injury via oxidant stress. Also, it was concluded that melatonin treatment may prevent liver oxidant stress induced by distant injury of kidney IR."

In order to determine the changes of cellular antioxidant defense systems, antioxidant enzymes including glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in serum. Moreover we also measured serum nitric oxide (NO) and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation. RESULTS: STZ-induced diabetes caused an elevation (p < 0.001) of blood glucose, MDA, NO, total lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol, with reduction of GSH level and CAT and SOD activities. The results indicated that the significant elevation in the blood glucose, MDA, NO, total lipids, triglycerides, cholesterol and reduction of glutathione level and CAT and SOD activity were ameliorated in the safranal-treated diabetic groups compared with the untreated groups, in a dose dependent manner (p < 0.05, p<0.01, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that safranal has antioxidant properties and improves chemically-induced diabetes and its complications by modulation of oxidative stress."

                "title": "Expression of \u03b1-Klotho Is Downregulated and Associated with Oxidative Stress in the Lens in Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Rats.",
                "abstract": "Purpose: Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cataract. The lens in diabetes mellitus (DM) has been shown to exhibit impaired antioxidant defenses, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Accumulating evidence reveals that Klotho family genes can regulate antioxidant defenses and prevent oxidative stress in multiple tissues. Here, we examined whether DM alters Klotho expression in the lens and if so, whether altered Klotho expression is associated with oxidative stress in the lens in DM. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into DM and control groups. DM was induced by injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg ip) and control rats were injected with vehicle. Twelve weeks after DM induction, levels of \u03b1-Klotho in plasma, expression of \u03b1- and \u03b3-Klotho, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and levels of antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione (GSH) and oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) in the lens were measured. Results: Diabetic rats had markedly higher blood glucose concentrations and lower plasma \u03b1-Klotho levels than control rats. Both \u03b1- and \u03b3-Klotho were expressed in the lens in diabetic and control rats. The expression of \u03b1-Klotho but not \u03b3-Klotho in the lens was downregulated in diabetic rats, which was accompanied by reduced expression of nuclear Nrf2 and levels of all antioxidants and increased levels of MDA. Moreover, expression of \u03b1-Klotho in the lens was positively correlated with expression of nuclear Nrf2 and levels of all antioxidants, but negatively correlated with levels of MDA. Conclusions: These findings suggest that DM selectively reduces \u03b1-Klotho levels in the circulation and lens, which may attenuate transcriptional activity of Nrf2 and impair antioxidant defenses in response to oxidative insults, contributing to oxidative stress and cataract formation in DM."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of separate and concurrent supplementation of natural nano-sized clinoptilolite (NCLN) and Nigella sativa (NS) on oxidative stress (OS), anti-oxidative parameters and body weight (BW) in high-fat-diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: In this experimental study, 42 male Wistar rats were divided into diabetic (n=36) and non-diabetic (n=6) groups. The diabetic group (DG) was fed with a HFD for one month, then injected with intra-peritoneal single dose STZ (35\u2009mg/kg BW). The DG was divided into 4 subgroups: [1] control (DC), [2] NS 1%/food, [3] NCLN 2%/food, [4] NS 1%/food\u2009+\u2009NCLN 2%/food. At the end of the 7th week, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured. RESULTS: The MDA level was decreased in the NCLN (p\u2009=\u20090.011) and NCLN+NS (p\u2009=\u20090.007) groups compared to the DC group. The GPX level increased in the NS and NCLN groups compared to the DC group (p\u2009=\u20090.014 and p\u2009=\u20090.034). In addition, the level of TAC demonstrated increase in the untreated DG and NS groups, as compared to the normal control (NC) group (pDC\u2009=\u20090.031 and pNS\u2009=\u20090.024). Moreover, in the NS+NCLN group, the level of SOD decreased in comparison to the NS and NCLN groups (p\u2009<\u20090.01). At the end of the 7th week, BW decreased in the diabetic subgroups in comparison to the NC group. Treatment with NS and/or NS+NCLN insignificantly prevented severe weight loss in the fifth week of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: According to results, separate supplementation of NS and NCLN was more beneficent on anti-oxidative parameters than concurrent supplementation of NS and NCLN."

            "abstract": "The naturally occurring amino acid, l-ergothioneine (EGT), has immense potential as a therapeutic, having shown promise in the treatment of other disease models, including neurological disorders. EGT is naturally uptaken into cells via its specific receptor, OCTN1, to be utilized by cells as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. In our current study, EGT was administered over a period of 6 months to 25-26-month-old CBA/CaJ mice as a possible treatment for age-related hearing loss (ARHL), since presbycusis has been linked to higher levels of cochlear oxidative stress, apoptosis, and chronic inflammation. Results from the current study indicate that EGT can prevent aging declines of some key features of ARHL. However, we found a distinct sex difference for the response to the treatments, for hearing - Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs). Males exhibited lower threshold declines in both low dose (LD) and high dose (HD) test groups throughout the testing period and did not display some of the characteristic aging declines in hearing seen in Control animals. In contrast, female mice did not show any therapeutic effects with either treatment dose. Further confirming this sex difference, EGT levels in whole blood sampling throughout the testing period showed greater uptake of EGT in males compared to females. Additionally, RT-PCR results from three tissue types of the inner ear confirmed EGT activity in the cochlea in both males and females. Males and females exhibited significant differences in biomarkers related to apoptosis (Cas-3), inflammation (TNF-a), oxidative stress (SOD2), and mitochondrial health (PGC1a).These changes were more prominent in males as compared to females, especially in stria vascularis tissue. Taken together, these findings suggest that EGT has the potential to be a naturally derived therapeutic for slowing down the progression of ARHL, and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases. EGT, while effective in the treatment of some features of presbycusis in aging males, could also be modified into a general prophylaxis for other age-related disorders where treatment protocols would include eating a larger proportion of EGT-rich foods or supplements. Lastly, the sex difference discovered here, needs further investigation to see if therapeutic conditions can be developed where aging females show better responsiveness to EGT."

We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin."

                "title": "Can a Liquid Biopsy Detect Circulating Tumor DNA With Low-passage Whole-genome Sequencing in Patients With a Sarcoma? A Pilot Evaluation.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A liquid biopsy is a test that evaluates the status of a disease by analyzing a sample of bodily fluid, most commonly blood. In recent years, there has been progress in the development and clinical application of liquid biopsy methods to identify blood-based, tumor-specific biomarkers for many cancer types. However, the implementation of these technologies to aid in the treatment of patients who have a sarcoma remains behind other fields of cancer medicine. For this study, we chose to evaluate a sarcoma liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). All human beings have normal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the blood. In contrast with cfDNA, ctDNA is genetic material present in the blood stream that is derived from a tumor. ctDNA carries the unique genomic fingerprint of the tumor with changes that are not present in normal circulating cfDNA. A successful ctDNA liquid biopsy must be able to target these tumor-specific genetic alterations. For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in lung cancers, and ctDNA liquid biopsies are currently in clinical use to evaluate the status of disease in patients who have a lung cancer by detecting EGFR mutations in the blood. As opposed to many carcinomas, sarcomas do not have common recurrent mutations that could serve as the foundation to a ctDNA liquid biopsy. However, many sarcomas have structural changes to their chromosomes, including gains and losses of portions or entire chromosomes, known as copy number alterations (CNAs), that could serve as a target for a ctDNA liquid biopsy. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) amplification in select lipomatous tumors or parosteal osteosarcoma is an example of a CNA due to the presence of extra copies of a segment of the long arm of chromosome 12. Since a majority of sarcomas demonstrate a complex karyotype with numerous CNAs, a blood-based liquid biopsy strategy that searches for these CNAs may be able to detect the presence of sarcoma ctDNA. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a next-generation sequencing technique that evaluates the entire genome. The depth of coverage of WGS refers to how detailed the sequencing is, like higher versus lower power on a microscope. WGS can be performed with high-depth sequencing (that is, > 60\u00d7), which can detect individual point mutations, or low-depth sequencing (that is, 0.1\u00d7 to 5\u00d7), referred to as low-passage whole-genome sequencing (LP-WGS), which may not detect individual mutations but can detect structural chromosomal changes including gains and losses (that is, CNAs). While similar strategies have shown favorable early results for specific sarcoma subtypes, LP-WGS has not been evaluated for applicability to the broader population of patients who have a sarcoma. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Does an LP-WGS liquid biopsy evaluating for CNAs detect ctDNA in plasma samples from patients who have sarcomas representing a variety of histologic subtypes? METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted at a community-based, tertiary referral center. Nine paired (plasma and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue) and four unpaired (plasma) specimens from patients who had a sarcoma were obtained from a commercial biospecimen bank. Three control specimens from individuals who did not have cancer were also obtained. The paired and unpaired specimens from patients who had a sarcoma represented a variety of sarcoma histologic subtypes. cfDNA was extracted, amplified, and quantified. Libraries were prepared, and LP-WGS was performed using a NextSeq 500 next-generation sequencing machine at a low depth of sequencing coverage (\u223c1\u00d7). The ichorCNA bioinformatics algorithm, which was designed to detect CNAs from low-depth genomic sequencing data, was used to analyze the data. In contrast with the gold standard for diagnosis in the form of histopathologic analysis of a tissue sample, this test does not discriminate between sarcoma subtypes but detects the presence of tumor-derived CNAs within the ctDNA in the blood that should not be present in a patient who does not have cancer. The liquid biopsy was positive for the detection of cancer if the ichorCNA algorithm detected the presence of ctDNA. The algorithm was also used to quantitatively estimate the percent ctDNA within the cfDNA. The concentration of ctDNA was then calculated from the percent ctDNA relative to the total concentration of cfDNA. The CNAs of the paired FFPE tissue and plasma samples were graphically visualized using aCNViewer software. RESULTS: This LP-WGS liquid biopsy detected ctDNA in 9 of 13 of the plasma specimens from patients with a sarcoma. The other four samples from patients with a sarcoma and all serum specimens from patients without cancer had no detectable ctDNA. Of those 9 patients with positive liquid biopsy results, the percent ctDNA ranged from 6% to 11%, and calculated ctDNA quantities were 0.04 to 5.6 ng/mL, which are levels to be expected when ctDNA is detectable. CONCLUSION: In this small pilot study, we were able to detect sarcoma ctDNA with an LP-WGS liquid biopsy searching for CNAs in the plasma of most patients who had a sarcoma representing a variety of histologic subtypes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results suggest that an LP-WGS liquid biopsy evaluating for CNAs to identify ctDNA may be more broadly applicable to the population of patients who have a sarcoma than previously reported in studies focusing on specific subtypes. Large prospective clinical trials that gather samples at multiple time points during the process of diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance will be needed to further assess whether this technique can be clinically useful. At our institution, we are in the process of developing a large prospective clinical trial for this purpose."

                "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The estimated lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults worldwide has been estimated at 3.9%. PTSD appears to contribute to alterations in neuronal network connectivity patterns. Current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are associated with inadequate symptom improvement and high dropout rates. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive therapy involving induction of electrical currents in cortical brain tissue, may be an important treatment option for PTSD to improve remission rates and for people who cannot tolerate existing treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two clinical trials registers. We checked reference lists of relevant articles. The most recent search was January 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of rTMS versus sham rTMS for PTSD in adults from any treatment setting, including veterans. Eligible trials employed at least five rTMS treatment sessions with both active and sham conditions. We included trials with combination interventions, where a pharmacological agent or psychotherapy was combined with rTMS for both intervention and control groups. We included studies meeting the above criteria regardless of whether they reported any of our outcomes of interest. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane standards. Primary outcomes were PTSD severity immediately after treatment and serious adverse events during active treatment. Secondary outcomes were PTSD remission, PTSD response, PTSD severity at two follow-up time points after treatment, dropouts, and depression and anxiety severity immediately after treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs in the review (12 published; 1 unpublished dissertation), with 577 participants. Eight studies included stand-alone rTMS treatment, four combined rTMS with an evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment, and one investigated rTMS as an adjunctive to treatment-as-usual. Five studies were conducted in the USA, and some predominantly included white, male veterans. Active rTMS probably makes little to no difference to PTSD severity immediately following treatment (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.54 to 0.27; 3 studies, 99 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level for imprecision (sample size insufficient to detect a difference of medium effect size). We deemed one study as having a low risk of bias and the remaining two as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of change-from-baseline scores enabled inclusion of a greater number of studies (6 studies, 252 participants). This analysis yielded a similar outcome to our main analysis but also indicated significant heterogeneity in efficacy across studies, including two studies with a high risk of bias. Reported rates of serious adverse events were low, with seven reported (active rTMS: 6; sham rTMS: 1). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of active rTMS on serious adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 5.26, 95% CI 0.26 to 107.81; 5 studies, 251 participants; very low-certainty evidence [Active rTMS: 23/1000, sham rTMS: 4/1000]). We downgraded the evidence by one level for risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. We rated four of five studies as having a high risk of bias, and the fifth as 'some concerns' for bias. We were unable to assess PTSD remission immediately after treatment as none of the included studies reported this outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on moderate-certainty evidence, our review suggests that active rTMS probably makes little to no difference to PTSD severity immediately following treatment compared to sham stimulation. However, significant heterogeneity in efficacy was detected when we included a larger number of studies in sensitivity analysis. We observed considerable variety in participant and protocol characteristics across studies included in this review. For example, studies tended to be weighted towards inclusion of either male veterans or female civilians. Studies varied greatly in terms of the proportion of the sample with comorbid depression. Study protocols differed in treatment design and stimulation parameters (e.g. session number/duration, treatment course length, stimulation intensity/frequency, location of stimulation). These differences may affect efficacy, particularly when considering interactions with participant factors. Reported rates of serious adverse events were very low (< 1%) across active and sham conditions. It is uncertain whether rTMS increases the risk of serious adverse event occurrence, as our certainty of evidence was very low. Studies frequently lacked clear definitions for serious adverse events, as well as detail on tracking/assessment of data and information on the safety population. Increased reporting on these elements would likely aid the advancement of both research and clinical recommendations of rTMS for PTSD. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to meta-analyze PTSD remission, PTSD treatment response, and PTSD severity at different periods post-treatment. Further research into these outcomes could inform the clinical use of rTMS. Additionally, the relatively large contribution of data from trials that focused on white male veterans may limit the generalizability of our conclusions. This could be addressed by prioritizing recruitment of more diverse participant samples."

                "abstract": "Background: Homelessness is a traumatic experience, and can have a devastating effect on those experiencing it. People who are homeless often face significant barriers when accessing public services, and have often experienced adverse childhood events, extreme social disadvantage, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, neglect, low self-esteem, poor physical and mental health, and much lower life expectancy compared to the general population. Rates of problematic substance use are disproportionately high, with many using drugs and alcohol to deal with the stress of living on the street, to keep warm, or to block out memories of previous abuse or trauma. Substance dependency can also create barriers to successful transition to stable housing. Objectives: To understand the effectiveness of different substance use interventions for adults experiencing homelessness. Search Methods: The primary source of studies for was the 4th edition of the Homelessness Effectiveness Studies Evidence and Gaps Maps (EGM). Searches for the EGM were completed in September 2021. Other potential studies were identified through a call for grey evidence, hand-searching key journals, and unpacking relevant systematic reviews. Selection Criteria: Eligible studies were impact evaluations that involved some comparison group. We included studies that tested the effectiveness of substance use interventions, and measured substance use outcomes, for adults experiencing homelessness in high income countries. Data Collection and Analysis: Descriptive characteristics and statistical information in included studies were coded and checked by at least two members of the review team. Studies selected for the review were assessed for confidence in the findings. Standardised effect sizes were calculated and, if a study did not provide sufficient raw data for the calculation of an effect size, author(s) were contacted to obtain these data. We used random-effects meta-analysis and robust-variance estimation procedures to synthesise effect sizes. If a study included multiple effects, we carried out a critical assessment to determine (even if only theoretically) whether the effects are likely to be dependent. Where dependent effects were identified, we used robust variance estimation to determine whether we can account for these. Where effect sizes were converted from a binary to continuous measure (or vice versa), we undertook a sensitivity analysis by running an additional analysis with these studies omitted. We also assessed the sensitivity of results to inclusion of non-randomised studies and studies classified as low confidence in findings. All included an assessment of statistical heterogeneity. Finally, we undertook analysis to assess whether publication bias was likely to be a factor in our findings. For those studies that we were unable to include in meta-analysis, we have provided a narrative synthesis of the study and its findings. Main Results: We included 48 individual papers covering 34 unique studies. The studies covered 15, 255 participants, with all but one of the studies being from the United States and Canada. Most papers were rated as low confidence (n\u2009=\u200925, or 52%). By far the most common reason for studies being rated as low confidence was high rates of attrition and/or differential attrition of study participants, that fell below the What Works Clearinghouse liberal attrition standard. Eleven of the included studies were rated as medium confidence and 12 studies as high confidence. The interventions included in our analysis were more effective in reducing substance use than treatment as usual, with an overall effect size of -0.11\u2009SD (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.27, 0.05). There was substantial heterogeneity across studies, and the results were sensitive to the removal of low confidence studies (-0.21\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.59, 0.17] - 6 studies, 17 effect sizes), the removal of quasi-experimental studies (-0.14\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.02] - 14 studies, 41 effect sizes) and the removal of studies where an effect size had been converted from a binary to a continuous outcome (-0.08\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.31, 0.15] - 10 studies, 31 effect sizes). This suggests that the findings are sensitive to the inclusion of lower quality studies, although unusually the average effect increases when we removed low confidence studies. The average effect for abstinence-based interventions compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) service provision was -0.28\u2009SD (95% CI, -0.65, 0.09) (6 studies, 15 effect sizes), and for harm reduction interventions compared to a TAU service provision is close to 0 at 0.03\u2009SD (95% CI, -0.08, 0.14) (9 studies, 30 effect sizes). The confidence intervals for both estimates are wide and crossing zero. For both, the comparison groups are primarily abstinence-based, with the exception of two studies where the comparison group condition was unclear. We found that both Assertative Community Treatment and Intensive Case Management were no better than treatment as usual, with average effect on substance use of 0.03\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.13] and -0.47\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.72, -0.21] 0.05\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.28, 0.39] respectively. These findings are consistent with wider research, and it is important to note that we only examined the effect on substance use outcomes (these interventions can be effective in terms of other outcomes). We found that CM interventions can be effective in reducing substance use compared to treatment as usual, with an average effect of -0.47\u2009SD, 95% CI (-0.72, -0.21). All of these results need to be considered in light of the quality of the underlying evidence. There were six further interventions where we undertook narrative synthesis. These syntheses suggest that Group Work, Harm Reduction Psychotherapy, and Therapeutic Communities are effective in reducing substance use, with mixed results found for Motivational Interviewing and Talking Therapies (including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). The narrative synthesis suggested that Residential Rehabilitation was no better than treatment as usual in terms of reducing substance use for our population of interest. Authors' Conclusions: Although our analysis of harm reduction versus treatment as usual, abstinence versus treatment as usual, and harm reduction versus abstinence suggests that these different approaches make little real difference to the outcomes achieved in comparison to treatment as usual. The findings suggest that some individual interventions are more effective than others. The overall low quality of the primary studies suggests that further primary impact research could be beneficial."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Survival estimation for patients with symptomatic skeletal metastases ideally should be made before a type of local treatment has already been determined. Currently available survival prediction tools, however, were generated using data from patients treated either operatively or with local radiation alone, raising concerns about whether they would generalize well to all patients presenting for assessment. The Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithm (SORG-MLA), trained with institution-based data of surgically treated patients, and the Metastases location, Elderly, Tumor primary, Sex, Sickness/comorbidity, and Site of radiotherapy model (METSSS), trained with registry-based data of patients treated with radiotherapy alone, are two of the most recently developed survival prediction models, but they have not been tested on patients whose local treatment strategy is not yet decided. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which of these two survival prediction models performed better in a mixed cohort made up both of patients who received local treatment with surgery followed by radiotherapy and who had radiation alone for symptomatic bone metastases? (2) Which model performed better among patients whose local treatment consisted of only palliative radiotherapy? (3) Are laboratory values used by SORG-MLA, which are not included in METSSS, independently associated with survival after controlling for predictions made by METSSS? METHODS: Between 2010 and 2018, we provided local treatment for 2113 adult patients with skeletal metastases in the extremities at an urban tertiary referral academic medical center using one of two strategies: (1) surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy or (2) palliative radiotherapy alone. Every patient's survivorship status was ascertained either by their medical records or the national death registry from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration. After applying a priori designated exclusion criteria, 91% (1920) were analyzed here. Among them, 48% (920) of the patients were female, and the median (IQR) age was 62 years (53 to 70 years). Lung was the most common primary tumor site (41% [782]), and 59% (1128) of patients had other skeletal metastases in addition to the treated lesion(s). In general, the indications for surgery were the presence of a complete pathologic fracture or an impending pathologic fracture, defined as having a Mirels score of \u2265 9, in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of less than or equal to IV and who were considered fit for surgery. The indications for radiotherapy were relief of pain, local tumor control, prevention of skeletal-related events, and any combination of the above. In all, 84% (1610) of the patients received palliative radiotherapy alone as local treatment for the target lesion(s), and 16% (310) underwent surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Neither METSSS nor SORG-MLA was used at the point of care to aid clinical decision-making during the treatment period. Survival was retrospectively estimated by these two models to test their potential for providing survival probabilities. We first compared SORG to METSSS in the entire population. Then, we repeated the comparison in patients who received local treatment with palliative radiation alone. We assessed model performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration analysis, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUROC measures discrimination, which is the ability to distinguish patients with the event of interest (such as death at a particular time point) from those without. AUROC typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating random guessing and 1.0 a perfect prediction, and in general, an AUROC of \u2265 0.7 indicates adequate discrimination for clinical use. Calibration refers to the agreement between the predicted outcomes (in this case, survival probabilities) and the actual outcomes, with a perfect calibration curve having an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1. A positive intercept indicates that the actual survival is generally underestimated by the prediction model, and a negative intercept suggests the opposite (overestimation). When comparing models, an intercept closer to 0 typically indicates better calibration. Calibration can also be summarized as log(O:E), the logarithm scale of the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) survivors. A log(O:E) > 0 signals an underestimation (the observed survival is greater than the predicted survival); and a log(O:E) < 0 indicates the opposite (the observed survival is lower than the predicted survival). A model with a log(O:E) closer to 0 is generally considered better calibrated. The Brier score is the mean squared difference between the model predictions and the observed outcomes, and it ranges from 0 (best prediction) to 1 (worst prediction). The Brier score captures both discrimination and calibration, and it is considered a measure of overall model performance. In Brier score analysis, the \"null model\" assigns a predicted probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome and represents a model that adds no new information. A prediction model should achieve a Brier score at least lower than the null-model Brier score to be considered as useful. The DCA was developed as a method to determine whether using a model to inform treatment decisions would do more good than harm. It plots the net benefit of making decisions based on the model's predictions across all possible risk thresholds (or cost-to-benefit ratios) in relation to the two default strategies of treating all or no patients. The care provider can decide on an acceptable risk threshold for the proposed treatment in an individual and assess the corresponding net benefit to determine whether consulting with the model is superior to adopting the default strategies. Finally, we examined whether laboratory data, which were not included in the METSSS model, would have been independently associated with survival after controlling for the METSSS model's predictions by using the multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: Between the two models, only SORG-MLA achieved adequate discrimination (an AUROC of > 0.7) in the entire cohort (of patients treated operatively or with radiation alone) and in the subgroup of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy alone. SORG-MLA outperformed METSSS by a wide margin on discrimination, calibration, and Brier score analyses in not only the entire cohort but also the subgroup of patients whose local treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone. In both the entire cohort and the subgroup, DCA demonstrated that SORG-MLA provided more net benefit compared with the two default strategies (of treating all or no patients) and compared with METSSS when risk thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 at both 90 days and 1 year, indicating that using SORG-MLA as a decision-making aid was beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting for treatment was 0.2 to 0.9. Higher albumin, lower alkaline phosphatase, lower calcium, higher hemoglobin, lower international normalized ratio, higher lymphocytes, lower neutrophils, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, higher sodium, and lower white blood cells were independently associated with better 1-year and overall survival after adjusting for the predictions made by METSSS. CONCLUSION: Based on these discoveries, clinicians might choose to consult SORG-MLA instead of METSSS for survival estimation in patients with long-bone metastases presenting for evaluation of local treatment. Basing a treatment decision on the predictions of SORG-MLA could be beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting to undergo a particular treatment strategy ranged from 0.2 to 0.9. Future studies might investigate relevant laboratory items when constructing or refining a survival estimation model because these data demonstrated prognostic value independent of the predictions of the METSSS model, and future studies might also seek to keep these models up to date using data from diverse, contemporary patients undergoing both modern operative and nonoperative treatments.

                "title": "Azathioprine for people with multiple sclerosis.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, impacting around 2.8 million people worldwide. Characterised by recurrent relapses or progression, or both, it represents a substantial global health burden, affecting people, predominantly women, at a young age (the mean age of diagnosis is 32 years). Azathioprine is used to treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and it is used in clinical practice as an off-label intervention for MS, especially where access to on-label disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for MS is limited. Given this, a review of azathioprine's benefits and harms would be timely and valuable to inform shared healthcare decisions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of azathioprine (AZA) for relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), compared to other disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), placebo or no treatment. Specifically, we will assess the following comparisons. AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first-choice treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for relapsing forms of MS when switching from another DMT AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first-choice treatment for progressive forms of MS AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for progressive forms of MS when switching from another DMT SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an extensive search for relevant literature using standard Cochrane search methods. The most recent search date was 9 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting 12 months or more that compared azathioprine versus DMTs, placebo or no intervention in adults with MS. We considered evidence from non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) as these studies may provide additional evidence not available from RCTS. We excluded cluster-randomised trials, cross-over trials, interrupted time series, case reports and studies of within-group design with no control group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. There were three outcomes we considered to be critical: disability, relapse and serious adverse events (SAEs, as defined in the studies). We were also interested in other important outcomes: quality-of-life (QoL) impairment (mental score), short-term adverse events (gastrointestinal disorders), long-term adverse events (neoplasms) and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies: eight RCTs (1076 participants included in meta-analyses) and six NRSIs (1029 participants). These studies involved people with relapsing and progressive MS. Most studies included more women (57 to 83%) than men, with participants' average age at the onset of MS being between 29.4 and 33.4 years. Five RCTs and all six NRSIs were conducted in Europe (1793 participants); two RCTs were conducted in the USA (126 participants) and one in Iran (94 participants). The RCTs lasted two to three years, while NRSIs looked back up to 10 years. Four studies received some funding or support from commercial interests and five were funded by government or philanthropy; the other five provided no information about funding. There are three ongoing studies. Comparison groups included other DMTs (interferon beta and cyclosporine A), placebo or no treatment. Below, we report on azathioprine as a 'first choice' treatment compared to interferon beta for people with relapsing MS. None of the studies reported on any critical or important outcome for this comparison for progressive MS. No study was retrieved comparing azathioprine to placebo or other DMTs for either relapsing or progressive MS. Furthermore, the NRSIs did not provide information not already covered in the RCTs. Azathioprine as a first-choice treatment compared to other DMTs (specifically, interferon beta) for relapsing MS - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of azathioprine on the number of people with disability progression over two years compared to interferon beta (risk ratio (RR) 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 148 participants; very low certainty evidence). - Azathioprine may decrease the number of people with relapses over a one- to two-year follow-up compared to interferon beta (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86; 2 RCTs, 242 participants; low-certainty evidence). - Azathioprine may result in a possible increase in the number of people with SAEs over two years in comparison with interferon beta (RR 6.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 126.27; 1 RCT, 148 participants; low-certainty evidence). - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of azathioprine on the number of people with the short-term adverse event of gastrointestinal disorders over two years compared to interferon beta (RR 5.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 185.57; 2 RCTs, 242 participants; very low certainty evidence). We found no evidence comparing azathioprine to other DMTs for QoL impairment (mental score), long-term adverse events (neoplasms) or mortality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine has been proposed as an alternative treatment for MS when access to approved, on-label DMTs is limited, especially in resource-limited settings. The limited evidence available suggests that azathioprine may result in a modest benefit in terms of relapse frequency, with a possible increase in SAEs, when compared to interferon beta-1b, for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The evidence for the effect on disability progression and short-term adverse events is very uncertain. Caution is required in interpreting the conclusions of this review since our certainty in the available evidence on the benefits and harms of azathioprine in multiple sclerosis is low to very low, implying that further evidence is likely to change our conclusions. An important limitation we noted in the available evidence is the lack of long-term comparison with other treatments and the failure of most studies to measure outcomes that are important to people with multiple sclerosis, such as quality of life and cognitive decline. This is especially the case in the evidence relevant to people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis."

                "title": "Genedrive kit for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism m.1555A>G in neonates and their mothers: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.",
                "abstract": "Background: Neonates with suspected sepsis are commonly treated with gentamicin, an aminoglycoside. These antibiotics are associated with high risk of ototoxicity, including profound bilateral deafness, in people with the m.1555A>G mitochondrial genetic variant. Objective: This early value assessment summarised and critically assessed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the gene m.1555A>G variant in neonates and mothers of neonates needing antibiotics or anticipated to need antibiotics. Following feedback from the scoping workshop and specialist assessment subgroup meeting, we also considered the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the m.1555A>G variant in mothers prior to giving birth. Data sources: For clinical effectiveness, we searched three major databases in October 2022: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). For cost-effectiveness, in addition to the three mentioned databases we searched Cochrane and RePEc-IDEAS. Study selection: Study selection and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers (Ryan PW Kenny and Akvile Stoniute for clinical effectiveness and Hosein Shabaninejad and Tomos Robinson for cost-effectiveness). Any differences were resolved through discussion, or by a third reviewer (Nick Meader). Study appraisal: Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. One study (n\u2005=\u2005751 neonates recruited) was included in the clinical effectiveness review and no studies were included in the cost-effectiveness review. All except one outcome (test failure rate: low risk of bias) were rated as being at moderate risk of bias. The study reported accuracy of the test (sensitivity 100%, 95% confidence interval 29.2% to 100%; specificity 99.2%, 95% confidence interval 98% to 99.7%), number of neonates successfully tested (n\u2005=\u2005424/526 admissions), test failure rate (17.1%, although this was reduced to 5.7%), impact on antibiotic use (all those with a m.1555A>G genotype avoided aminoglycosides), time taken to obtain a sample (6 minutes), time to genotyping (26 minutes), time to antibiotic treatment (55.18 minutes) and the number of neonates with m.1555A>G (n\u2005=\u20053). Limitations: The economic component of this work identified key evidence gaps for which further data are required before a robust economic evaluation can be conducted. These include the sensitivity of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the gene m.1555A>G variant in neonates, the magnitude of risk for aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in neonates with m.1555A>G, and the prevalence of the m.1555A>G variant. Other potentially important gaps include how data regarding maternal inheritance may potentially be used in the clinical pathway. Conclusions: This early value assessment suggests that the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit has the potential to identify the m.1555A>G variant and to be cost-effective. The Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit dominates the current standard of care over the lifetime, as it is less costly and more effective. For a 50-year time horizon, the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit was also the dominant strategy. For a 10-year time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be \u00a3103 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Nevertheless, as anticipated, there is insufficient evidence to conduct a full diagnostic assessment of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit in neonates directly or in their mothers. This report includes a list of research priorities to reduce the uncertainty around this early value assessment and to provide the additional data needed to inform a full diagnostic assessment, including cost-effectiveness modelling.

                "title": "Antioxidants for female subfertility.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A couple may be considered to have fertility problems if they have been trying to conceive for over a year with no success. This may affect up to a quarter of all couples planning a child. It is estimated that for 40% to 50% of couples, subfertility may result from factors affecting women. Antioxidants are thought to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by these conditions. Currently, limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility, and trials have explored this area with varied results. This review assesses the evidence for the effectiveness of different antioxidants in female subfertility. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether supplementary oral antioxidants compared with placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases (from their inception to September 2019), with no language or date restriction: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and searched the trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose or combination of oral antioxidant supplement with placebo, no treatment or treatment with another antioxidant, among women attending a reproductive clinic. We excluded trials comparing antioxidants with fertility drugs alone and trials that only included fertile women attending a fertility clinic because of male partner infertility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary review outcome was live birth; secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy rates and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 63 trials involving 7760 women. Investigators compared oral antioxidants, including: combinations of antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine, melatonin, L-arginine, myo-inositol, carnitine, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D+calcium, CoQ10, and omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids versus placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant. Only 27 of the 63 included trials reported funding sources. Due to the very low-quality of the evidence we are uncertain whether antioxidants improve live birth rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (odds ratio (OR) 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.43; P < 0.001, I2 = 29%; 13 RCTs, 1227 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live birth rate of 19%, the rate among women using antioxidants would be between 24% and 36%. Low-quality evidence suggests that antioxidants may improve clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.89; P < 0.001, I2 = 63%; 35 RCTs, 5165 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 19%, the rate among women using antioxidants would be between 25% and 30%. Heterogeneity was moderately high. Overall 28 trials reported on various adverse events in the meta-analysis. The evidence suggests that the use of antioxidants makes no difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.55; P = 0.46, I2 = 0%; 24 RCTs, 3229 women; low-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of multiple pregnancy (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.56; P = 0.99, I2 = 0%; 9 RCTs, 1886 women; low-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of gastrointestinal disturbances (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.47 to 5.10; P = 0.47, I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 343 women; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence showed that there was also no difference between the groups in rates of ectopic pregnancy (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 7.20; P = 0.69, I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs, 404 women). In the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison, low-quality evidence shows no difference in a lower dose of melatonin being associated with an increased live-birth rate compared with higher-dose melatonin (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.15; P = 0.89, I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 140 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live-birth rate of 24%, the rate among women using a lower dose of melatonin compared to a higher dose would be between 12% and 40%. Similarly with clinical pregnancy, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates between a lower and a higher dose of melatonin (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.15; P = 0.89, I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 140 women). Three trials reported on miscarriage in the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison (two used doses of melatonin and one compared N-acetylcysteine versus L-carnitine). There were no miscarriages in either melatonin trial. Multiple pregnancy and gastrointestinal disturbances were not reported, and ectopic pregnancy was reported by only one trial, with no events. The study comparing N-acetylcysteine with L-carnitine did not report live birth rate. Very low-quality evidence shows no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.00; 1 RCT, 164 women; low-quality evidence). Low quality evidence shows no difference in miscarriage (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.67; 1 RCT, 164 women; low-quality evidence). The study did not report multiple pregnancy, gastrointestinal disturbances or ectopic pregnancy. The overall quality of evidence was limited by serious risk of bias associated with poor reporting of methods, imprecision and inconsistency. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this review, there was low- to very low-quality evidence to show that taking an antioxidant may benefit subfertile women. Overall, there is no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage, multiple births, gastrointestinal effects or ectopic pregnancies, but evidence was of very low quality. At this time, there is limited evidence in support of supplemental oral antioxidants for subfertile women."

                "title": "Radiation protection following nuclear power accidents: a survey of putative mechanisms involved in the radioprotective actions of taurine during and after radiation exposure.",
                "abstract": "There are several animal experiments showing that high doses of ionizing radiation lead to strongly enhanced leakage of taurine from damaged cells into the extracellular fluid, followed by enhanced urinary excretion. This radiation-induced taurine depletion can itself have various harmful effects (as will also be the case when taurine depletion is due to other causes, such as alcohol abuse or cancer therapy with cytotoxic drugs), but taurine supplementation has been shown to have radioprotective effects apparently going beyond what might be expected just as a consequence of correcting the harmful consequences of taurine deficiency per se. The mechanisms accounting for the radioprotective effects of taurine are, however, very incompletely understood. In this article an attempt is made to survey various mechanisms that potentially might be involved as parts of the explanation for the overall beneficial effect of high levels of taurine that has been found in experiments with animals or isolated cells exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. It is proposed that taurine may have radioprotective effects by a combination of several mechanisms: (1) during the exposure to ionizing radiation by functioning as an antioxidant, but perhaps more because it counteracts the prooxidant catalytic effect of iron rather than functioning as an important scavenger of harmful molecules itself, (2) after the ionizing radiation exposure by helping to reduce the intensity of the post-traumatic inflammatory response, and thus reducing the extent of tissue damage that develops because of severe inflammation rather than as a direct effect of the ionizing radiation per se, (3) by functioning as a growth factor helping to enhance the growth rate of leukocytes and leukocyte progenitor cells and perhaps also of other rapidly proliferating cell types, such as enterocyte progenitor cells, which may be important for immunological recovery and perhaps also for rapid repair of various damaged tissues, especially in the intestines, and (4) by functioning as an antifibrogenic agent. A detailed discussion is given of possible mechanisms involved both in the antioxidant effects of taurine, in its anti-inflammatory effects and in its role as a growth factor for leukocytes and nerve cells, which might be closely related to its role as an osmolyte important for cellular volume regulation because of the close connection between cell volume regulation and the regulation of protein synthesis as well as cellular protein degradation. While taurine supplementation alone would be expected to exert a therapeutic effect far better than negligible in patients that have been exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation, it may on theoretical grounds be expected that much better results may be obtained by using taurine as part of a multifactorial treatment strategy, where it may interact synergistically with several other nutrients, hormones or other drugs for optimizing antioxidant protection and minimizing harmful posttraumatic inflammatory reactions, while using other nutrients to optimize DNA and tissue repair processes, and using a combination of good diet, immunostimulatory hormones and perhaps other nontoxic immunostimulants (such as beta-glucans) for optimizing the recovery of antiviral and antibacterial immune functions. Similar multifactorial treatment strategies may presumably be helpful in several other disease situations (including severe infectious diseases and severe asthma) as well as for treatment of acute intoxications or acute injuries (both mechanical ones and severe burns) where severely enhanced oxidative and/or nitrative stress and/or too much secretion of vasodilatory neuropeptides from C-fibres are important parts of the pathogenetic mechanisms that may lead to the death of the patient. Some case histories (with discussion of some of those mechanisms that may have been responsible for the observed therapeutic outcome) are given for illustration of the likely validity of these concepts and their relevance both for treatment of severe infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.

                "title": "Defining the optimum strategy for identifying adults and children with coeliac disease: systematic review and economic modelling.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingesting gluten. It affects approximately 1% of the UK population, but only one in three people is thought to have a diagnosis. Untreated coeliac disease may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis and lymphoma. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to define at-risk groups and determine the cost-effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in primary care. DESIGN: (1) Systematic review of the accuracy of potential diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease. (2) Routine data analysis to develop prediction models for identification of people who may benefit from testing for coeliac disease. (3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives. DATA SOURCES: For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE\u00ae (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA), Embase\u00ae (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library, Web of Science\u2122 (Clarivate\u2122, Philadelphia, PA, USA), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( WHO ICTRP ) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For the second systematic review, the following databases were searched from January 1990 to August 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews ( KSR ) Evidence, WHO ICTRP and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For prediction model development, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and a subcohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used; for estimates for the economic models, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum was used. REVIEW METHODS: For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed. RESULTS: People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (n\u2009=\u2009472) wanted to be 66% certain of the diagnosis from a blood test before starting a gluten-free diet if symptomatic, and 90% certain if asymptomatic. Cost-effectiveness analyses found that, among adults, and using serological testing alone, immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase was most cost-effective at a 1% pre-test probability (equivalent to population screening). Strategies using immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody plus human leucocyte antigen or human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability had similar cost-effectiveness results, which were also similar to the cost-effectiveness results of immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase at a 1% pre-test probability. The most practical alternative for implementation within the NHS is likely to be a combination of human leucocyte antigen and immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing among those with a pre-test probability above 1.5%. Among children, the most cost-effective strategy was a 10% pre-test probability with human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, but there was uncertainty around the most cost-effective pre-test probability. There was substantial uncertainty in economic model results, which means that there would be great value in conducting further research. LIMITATIONS: The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia). FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies. Large prospective cohort studies in which all participants receive accurate tests for coeliac disease are needed.

                "title": "Drug therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) applied via a mask during sleep. However, this is not tolerated by all individuals and its role in mild OSA is not proven. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be of value in patients intolerant of CPAP. A number of mechanisms have been proposed by which drugs could reduce the severity of OSA. These include an increase in tone in the upper airway dilator muscles, an increase in ventilatory drive, a reduction in the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increase in cholinergic tone during sleep, an increase in arousal threshold, a reduction in airway resistance and a reduction in surface tension in the upper airway. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of drug therapies in the specific treatment of sleep apnoea. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches were current as of July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, placebo controlled trials involving adult patients with confirmed OSA. We excluded trials if continuous positive airways pressure, mandibular devices or oxygen therapy were used. We excluded studies investigating treatment of associated conditions such as excessive sleepiness, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and obesity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty trials of 25 drugs, involving 516 participants, contributed data to the review. Drugs had several different proposed modes of action and the results were grouped accordingly in the review. Each of the studies stated that the participants had OSA but diagnostic criteria were not always explicit and it was possible that some patients with central apnoeas may have been recruited.Acetazolamide, eszopiclone, naltrexone, nasal lubricant (phosphocholinamine) and physiostigmine were administered for one to two nights only. Donepezil in patients with and without Alzheimer's disease, fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis, combinations of ondansetrone and fluoxetine and paroxetine were trials of one to three months duration, however most of the studies were small and had methodological limitations. The overall quality of the available evidence was low.The primary outcomes for the systematic review were the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and the level of sleepiness associated with OSA, estimated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). AHI was reported in 25 studies and of these 10 showed statistically significant reductions in AHI.Fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis was well tolerated and reduced the severity of sleep apnoea compared with placebo (AHI 23.3 versus 30.3; P < 0.05) and improved subjective daytime alertness. Excessive sleepiness was reported to be altered in four studies, however the only clinically and statistically significant change in ESS of -2.9 (SD 2.9; P = 0.04) along with a small but statistically significant reduction in AHI of -9.4 (SD 17.2; P = 0.03) was seen in patients without Alzheimer's disease receiving donepezil for one month. In 23 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease donepezil led to a significant reduction in AHI (donepezil 20 (SD 15) to 9.9 (SD 11.5) versus placebo 23.2 (SD 26.4) to 22.9 (SD 28.8); P = 0.035) after three months of treatment but no reduction in sleepiness was reported. High dose combined treatment with ondansetron 24 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg showed a 40.5% decrease in AHI from the baseline at treatment day 28. Paroxetine was shown to reduce AHI compared to placebo (-6.10 events/hour; 95% CI -11.00 to -1.20) but failed to improve daytime symptoms.Promising results from the preliminary mirtazapine study failed to be reproduced in the two more recent multicentre trials and, moreover, the use of mirtazapine was associated with significant weight gain and sleepiness. Few data were presented on the long-term tolerability of any of the compounds used. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drug therapy in the treatment of OSA. Small studies have reported positive effects of certain agents on short-term outcomes. Certain agents have been shown to reduce the AHI in largely unselected populations with OSA by between 24% and 45%. For donepezil and fluticasone, studies of longer duration with a larger population and better matching of groups are required to establish whether the change in AHI and impact on daytime symptoms are reproducible. Individual patients had more complete responses to particular drugs. It is possible that better matching of drugs to patients according to the dominant mechanism of their OSA will lead to better results and this also needs further study."

                "title": "Topical and oral steroids for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. Although most episodes of OME in children resolve spontaneously within a few months, when persistent it may lead to behavioural problems and a delay in expressive language skills. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical and other treatments, such as autoinflation. Oral or topical steroids are sometimes used to reduce inflammation in the middle ear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of topical and oral steroids for OME in children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies on 20 January 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared topical or oral steroids with either placebo or watchful waiting (no treatment). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes, determined by a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise, were: 1) hearing, 2) OME-specific quality of life and 3) systemic corticosteroid side effects. Secondary outcomes were: 1) presence/persistence of OME, 2) other adverse effects (including local nasal effects), 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial outcomes, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies in this review (2770 children). Most studies of oral steroids used prednisolone for 7 to 14 days. Studies of topical (nasal) steroids used various preparations (beclomethasone, fluticasone and mometasone) for between two weeks and three months. All studies had at least some concerns regarding risk of bias. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up. Oral steroids compared to placebo Oral steroids probably result in little or no difference in the proportion of children with normal hearing after 12 months (69.7% of children with steroids, compared to 61.1% of children receiving placebo, risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.33; 1 study, 332 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in OME-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) in OM8-30 score 0.07, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.34; 1 study, 304 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Oral steroids may reduce the number of children with persistent OME at 6 to 12 months, but the size of the effect was uncertain (absolute risk reduction ranging from 13.3% to 45%, number needed to treat (NNT) of between 3 and 8; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain regarding the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects, and we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis for this outcome. Oral steroids compared to no treatment Oral steroids may result in little or no difference in the persistence of OME after three to nine months (74.5% children receiving steroids versus 73% of those receiving placebo; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 258 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence on adverse effects was very uncertain. We did not identify any evidence on hearing or disease-related quality of life. Topical (intranasal) steroids compared to placebo We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, the mean change in hearing threshold after two months was -0.3 dB lower (95% CI -6.05 to 5.45; 1 study, 78 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that nasal steroids make little or no difference to disease-specific quality of life after nine months (OM8-30 score, MD 0.05 higher, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.46; 1 study, 82 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of nasal steroids on persistence of OME at up to one year. Two studies reported this: one showed a potential benefit for nasal steroids, the other showed a benefit with placebo (2 studies, 206 participants). The evidence was also very uncertain regarding the risk of corticosteroid-related side effects, as we were unable to provide a pooled effect estimate. Topical (intranasal) steroids compared to no treatment We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, the mean difference in final hearing threshold after four weeks was 1.95 dB lower (95% CI -3.85 to -0.05; 1 study, 168 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nasal steroids may reduce the persistence of OME after eight weeks, but the evidence was very uncertain (58.5% of children receiving steroids, compared to 81.3% of children without treatment, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 2 studies, 134 participants). We did not identify any evidence on disease-related quality of life or adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, oral steroids may have little effect in the treatment of OME, with little improvement in the number of children with normal hearing and no effect on quality of life. There may be a reduction in the proportion of children with persistent disease after 12 months. However, this benefit may be small and must be weighed against the potential for adverse effects associated with oral steroid use. The evidence for nasal steroids was all low- or very low-certainty. It is therefore less clear if nasal steroids have any impact on hearing, quality of life or persistence of OME. Evidence on adverse effects was very limited. OME is likely to resolve spontaneously for most children. The potential benefit of treatment may therefore be small and should be balanced with the risk of adverse effects. Future studies should aim to determine which children are most likely to benefit from treatment, rather than offering interventions to all children."

                "title": "Workplace interventions to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of healthcare settings.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) experience no or mild symptoms, some individuals can develop severe illness and may die, particularly older people and those with underlying medical problems. Providing evidence-based interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection has become more urgent with the potential psychological toll imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is the fundamental method of protecting workers. When it comes to the transmission of viruses, workplaces should first consider control measures that can potentially have the most significant impact. According to the hierarchy of controls, one should first consider elimination (and substitution), then engineering controls, administrative controls, and lastly, personal protective equipment. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published 6 May 2022, with one new study added. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of interventions in non-healthcare-related workplaces aimed at reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other interventions or no intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collections, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv to 13 April 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions. We included adult workers, both those who come into close contact with clients or customers (e.g. public-facing employees, such as cashiers or taxi drivers), and those who do not, but who could be infected by coworkers. We excluded studies involving healthcare workers. We included any intervention to prevent or reduce workers' exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace, defining categories of intervention according to the hierarchy of hazard controls (i.e. elimination; engineering controls; administrative controls; personal protective equipment). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (or other respiratory viruses), SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, adverse events, and absenteeism from work. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, quality of life, hospitalisation, and uptake, acceptability, or adherence to strategies. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias, and GRADE methods to evaluate the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 2 studies including a total of 16,014 participants. Elimination-of-exposure interventions We included one study examining an intervention that focused on elimination of hazards, which was an open-label, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial, conducted in England in 2021. The study compared standard 10-day self-isolation after contact with an infected person to a new strategy of daily rapid antigen testing and staying at work if the test is negative (test-based attendance). The trialists hypothesised that this would lead to a similar rate of infections, but lower COVID-related absence. Staff (N = 11,798) working at 76 schools were assigned to standard isolation, and staff (N = 12,229) working at 86 schools were assigned to the test-based attendance strategy. The results between test-based attendance and standard 10-day self-isolation were inconclusive for the rate of symptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (rate ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.21; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The results between test-based attendance and standard 10-day self-isolation were inconclusive for the rate of any PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.21; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). COVID-related absenteeism rates were 3704 absence days in 566,502 days-at-risk (6.5 per 1000 working days) in the control group and 2932 per 539,805 days-at-risk (5.4 per 1000 working days) in the intervention group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.25). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision. Uptake of the intervention was 71% in the intervention group, but not reported for the control intervention. The trial did not measure our other outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, adverse events, all-cause mortality, quality of life, or hospitalisation. We found seven ongoing studies using elimination-of-hazard strategies, six RCTs and one non-randomised trial. Administrative control interventions We found one ongoing RCT that aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection and reducing disease severity. Combinations of eligible interventions We included one non-randomised study examining a combination of elimination of hazards, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment. The study was conducted in two large retail companies in Italy in 2020. The study compared a safety operating protocol, measurement of body temperature and oxygen saturation upon entry, and a SARS-CoV-2 test strategy with a minimum activity protocol. Both groups received protective equipment. All employees working at the companies during the study period were included: 1987 in the intervention company and 1798 in the control company. The study did not report an outcome of interest for this systematic review. Other intervention categories We did not find any studies in this category. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether a test-based attendance policy affects rates of PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (any infection; symptomatic infection) compared to standard 10-day self-isolation amongst school and college staff. A test-based attendance policy may result in little to no difference in absenteeism rates compared to standard 10-day self-isolation. The non-randomised study included in our updated search did not report any outcome of interest for this Cochrane review. As a large part of the population is exposed in the case of a pandemic, an apparently small relative effect that would not be worthwhile from the individual perspective may still affect many people, and thus become an important absolute effect from the enterprise or societal perspective. The included RCT did not report on any of our other primary outcomes (i.e. SARS-CoV-2-related mortality and adverse events). We identified no completed studies on any other interventions specified in this review; however, eight eligible studies are ongoing. More controlled studies are needed on testing and isolation strategies, and working from home, as these have important implications for work organisations."

                "abstract": "Background: Phenotypic data, such as the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical samples, are widely available through routine surveillance. MIC distributions inform antibiotic dosing in clinical care by determining cutoffs to define isolates as susceptible or resistant. However, differences in MIC distributions between patient sub-populations could indicate strain variation and hence differences in transmission, infection, or selection. Methods: The Vivli AMR register contains a wealth of MIC and metadata for a vast range of bacteria-antibiotic combinations. Using a generalisable methodology followed by multivariate regression, we explored MIC distribution variations across 4 bacteria, covering 7,135,070 samples, by key population sub-groups such as age, sex and infection type, and over time. Results: We found clear differences between MIC distributions across various patient sub-groups for a subset of bacteria-antibiotic pairings. For example, within Staphylococcus aureus, MIC distributions by age group and infection site displayed clear trends, especially for levofloxacin with higher resistance levels in older age groups (odds of 2.17 in those aged 85+ compared to 19-64), which appeared more often in men. This trend could reflect greater use of fluoroquinolones in adults than children but also reveals an increasing MIC level with age, suggesting either transmission differences or accumulation of resistance effects. We also observed high variations by WHO region, and over time, with the latter likely linked to changes in surveillance. Conclusions: We found that MIC distributions can be used to identify differences in AMR levels between population sub-groups. Our methodology could be used more widely to unveil hidden transmission sources and effects of antibiotic use in different patient sub-groups, highlighting opportunities to improve stewardship programmes and interventions, particularly at local scales."

                "title": "Conservative, physical and surgical interventions for managing faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseases.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003, 2006 and 2014. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of conservative, physical and surgical interventions for managing FI and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 March 2023), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised, quasi-randomised (where allocation is not strictly random), cross-over and cluster-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative, physical or surgical intervention against placebo, usual care or no intervention for the management of FI and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in eligible trials using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of prespecified outcome measures. We produced summary of findings tables for our main outcome measures and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies with 1598 participants. The studies were generally at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel to the intervention. Half of the included studies were also at high risk of bias in terms of selective reporting. Outcomes were often reported heterogeneously across studies, making it difficult to pool data. We did not find enough evidence to be able to analyse the effects of interventions on individual central neurological diseases. Additionally, very few studies reported on the primary outcomes of self-reported improvement in FI or constipation, or Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score. Conservative interventions compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo Thirteen studies assessed this comparison. The interventions included assessment-based nursing, holistic nursing, probiotics, psyllium, faecal microbiota transplantation, and a stepwise protocol of increasingly invasive evacuation methods. Conservative interventions may result in a large improvement in faecal incontinence (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.47 to -0.23; 3 studies; n = 410; low-certainty evidence). We interpreted SMD \u2265 0.80 as a large effect. It was not possible to pool all data from studies that assessed improvement in constipation, but the evidence suggested that conservative interventions may improve constipation symptoms (data not pooled; 8 studies; n = 612; low-certainty evidence). Conservative interventions may lead to a reduction in mean time taken on bowel care (data not pooled; 5 studies; n = 526; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain about the effects of conservative interventions on condition-specific quality of life and adverse events. Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score was not reported. Physical therapy compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo Twelve studies assessed this comparison. The interventions included massage therapy, standing, osteopathic manipulative treatment, electrical stimulation, transanal irrigation, and conventional physical therapy with visceral mobilisation. Physical therapies may make little to no difference to self-reported faecal continence assessed using the St Mark's Faecal Incontinence Score, where the minimally important difference is five, or the Cleveland Constipation Score (MD -2.60, 95% CI -4.91 to -0.29; 3 studies; n = 155; low-certainty evidence). Physical therapies may result in a moderate improvement in constipation symptoms (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.14; 9 studies; n = 431; low-certainty evidence). We interpreted SMD \u2265 0.5 as a moderate effect. However, physical therapies may make little to no difference in Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score as the minimally important difference for this tool is 3 (MD -1.94, 95% CI -3.36 to -0.51; 7 studies; n = 358; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of physical therapies on the time spent on bowel care, condition-specific quality of life and adverse effects (all very low-certainty evidence). Surgical interventions compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo No studies were found for surgical interventions that met the inclusion criteria for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There remains little research on this common and, for patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other. Understanding whether there is a clinically-meaningful difference from the results of available trials is largely hampered by the lack of uniform outcome measures. This is due to an absence of core outcome sets, and development of these needs to be a research priority to allow studies to be compared directly. Some studies used validated constipation, incontinence or condition-specific measures; however, others used unvalidated analogue scales to report effectiveness. Some studies did not use any patient-reported outcomes and focused on physiological outcome measures, which is of relatively limited significance in terms of clinical implementation. There was evidence in favour of some conservative interventions, but these findings need to be confirmed by larger, well-designed controlled trials, which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life."

                "title": "Individualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI).",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During a stimulated cycle of in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), women receive daily doses of gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to induce multifollicular development in the ovaries. A normal response to stimulation (e.g. retrieval of 5 to 15 oocytes) is considered desirable. Generally, the number of eggs retrieved is associated with the dose of FSH. Both hyper-response and poor response are associated with an increased chance of cycle cancellation. In hyper-response, this is due to increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), while poor response cycles are cancelled because the quantity and quality of oocytes is expected to be low. Clinicians often individualise the FSH dose using patient characteristics predictive of ovarian response. Traditionally, this meant women's age, but increasingly, clinicians use various ovarian reserve tests (ORTs). These include basal FSH (bFSH), antral follicle count (AFC), and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH). It is unclear whether individualising FSH dose improves clinical outcomes. This review updates the 2018 version. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of individualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF/ICSI. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers in February 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared (a) different doses of FSH in women with a defined ORT profile (i.e. predicted low, normal, or high responders based on AMH, AFC, and/or bFSH) or (b) an individualised dosing strategy (based on at least one ORT measure) versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcomes were live birth/ongoing pregnancy and severe OHSS. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies, involving 8520 women (6 new studies added to 20 studies included in the previous version). We treated RCTs with multiple comparisons as separate trials for the purpose of this review. Meta-analysis was limited due to clinical heterogeneity. Evidence certainty ranged from very low to low, with the main limitations being imprecision and risk of bias associated with lack of blinding. Direct dose comparisons according to predicted response in women Due to differences in dose comparisons, caution is required when interpreting the RCTs in predicted low responders. All evidence was low or very low certainty. Effect estimates were very imprecise, and increased FSH dosing may or may not have an impact on rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy, OHSS, and clinical pregnancy. Similarly, in predicted normal responders (10 studies, 4 comparisons), higher doses may or may not impact the probability of live birth/ongoing pregnancy (e.g. 200 versus 100 international units (IU): odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.36; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 522 women) or clinical pregnancy. Results were imprecise, and a small benefit or harm remains possible. There were too few events for the OHSS outcome to enable inferences. In predicted high responders, lower doses may or may not affect live birth/ongoing pregnancy (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.46; 1 study, 521 women), severe OHSS, and clinical pregnancy. It is also unclear whether lower doses reduce moderate or severe OHSS (Peto OR 2.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 6.67; 1 study, 521 participants). ORT-algorithm studies Eight trials compared an ORT-based algorithm to a non-ORT control group. It is unclear whether live birth/ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are increased using an ORT-based algorithm (live birth/ongoing pregnancy: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29; I2 = 30%; 7 studies, 4400 women; clinical pregnancy: OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18; I2 = 18%; 7 studies, 4400 women; low-certainty evidence). However, ORT algorithms may reduce moderate or severe OHSS (Peto OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; I2 = 0%; 7 studies, 4400 women; low-certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of severe OHSS (Peto OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.28; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 2724 women; low-certainty evidence). Our findings suggest that if the chance of live birth with a standard starting dose is 25%, the chance with ORT-based dosing would be between 25% and 31%. If the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a standard starting dose is 5%, the chance with ORT-based dosing would be between 2% and 5%. These results should be treated cautiously due to heterogeneity in the algorithms: some algorithms appear to be more effective than others. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We did not find that tailoring the FSH dose in any particular ORT population (low, normal, high ORT) affected live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates, but we could not rule out differences, due to sample size limitations. Low-certainty evidence suggests that it is unclear if ORT-based individualisation leads to an increase in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates compared to a policy of giving all women 150 IU. The confidence interval is consistent with an increase of up to around six percentage points with ORT-based dosing (e.g. from 25% to 31%) or a very small decrease (< 1%). A difference of this magnitude could be important to many women. It is unclear if this is driven by improved outcomes in a particular subgroup. Further, ORT algorithms reduced the incidence of OHSS compared to standard dosing of 150 IU. However, the size of the effect is also unclear. The included studies were heterogeneous in design, which limited the interpretation of pooled estimates. It is likely that different ORT algorithms differ in their effectiveness. Current evidence does not provide a clear justification for adjusting the dose of 150 IU in poor or normal responders, especially as increased dose is associated with greater total FSH dose and cost. It is unclear whether a decreased dose in predicted high responders reduces OHSS, although this would appear to be the most likely explanation for the results."

                "title": "Ceftazidime with avibactam for treating severe aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections: technology evaluation to inform a novel subscription-style payment model.",
                "abstract": "Background: To limit the use of antimicrobials without disincentivising the development of novel antimicrobials, there is interest in establishing innovative models that fund antimicrobials based on an evaluation of their value as opposed to the volumes used. The aim of this project was to evaluate the population-level health benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam in the NHS in England, for the treatment of severe aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections when used within its licensed indications. The results were used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance in support of commercial discussions regarding contract value between the manufacturer and NHS England. Methods: The health benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam was first derived for a series of high-value clinical scenarios. These represented uses that were expected to have a significant impact on patients' mortality risks and health-related quality of life. Patient-level costs and health-related quality of life of ceftazidime-avibactam under various usage scenarios compared with alternative management strategies in the high-value clinical scenarios were quantified using decision modelling. Results were reported as incremental net health effects expressed in quality-adjusted life-years, which were scaled to 20-year population in quality-adjusted life-years using infection number forecasts based on data from Public Health England. The outcomes estimated for the high-value clinical scenarios were extrapolated to other expected uses for ceftazidime-avibactam. Results: The clinical effectiveness of ceftazidime-avibactam relative to its comparators was estimated by synthesising evidence on susceptibility of the pathogens of interest to the antimicrobials in a network meta-analysis. In the base case, ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with a statistically significantly higher susceptibility relative to colistin (odds ratio 7.24, 95% credible interval 2.58 to 20.94). The remainder of the treatments were associated with lower susceptibility than colistin (odds ratio < 1). The results were sensitive to the definition of resistance and the studies included in the analysis. In the base case, patient-level benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam was between 0.08 and 0.16 quality-adjusted life-years, depending on the site of infection and the usage scenario. There was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the benefits of ceftazidime-avibactam across all subgroups, and the results were sensitive to assumptions in the meta-analysis used to estimate susceptibility. There was substantial uncertainty in the number of infections that are suitable for treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam, so population-level results are presented for a range of scenarios for the current infection numbers, the expected increases in infections over time, and rates of emergence of resistance. The population-level benefit varied substantially across the scenarios, from 531 to 2342 quality-adjusted life-years over 20 years. Conclusion: This work has provided quantitative estimates of the value of ceftazidime-avibactam within its areas of expected usage within the NHS. Limitations: Given existing evidence, the estimates of the value of ceftazidime-avibactam are highly uncertain. Future work: Future evaluations of antimicrobials would benefit from improvements to NHS data linkages, research to support appropriate synthesis of susceptibility studies, and application of routine data and decision modelling to assess enablement value.

                "title": "Impact of residual disease as a prognostic factor for survival in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer after primary surgery.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer among women and a leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type, accounting for around 90% of all ovarian cancers. This specific type of ovarian cancer starts in the surface layer covering the ovary or lining of the fallopian tube. Surgery is performed either before chemotherapy (upfront or primary debulking surgery (PDS)) or in the middle of a course of treatment with chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval debulking surgery (IDS)), with the aim of removing all visible tumour and achieving no macroscopic residual disease (NMRD). The aim of this review is to investigate the prognostic impact of size of residual disease nodules (RD) in women who received upfront or interval cytoreductive surgery for advanced (stage III and IV) epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognostic impact of residual disease after primary surgery on survival outcomes for advanced (stage III and IV) epithelial ovarian cancer. In separate analyses, primary surgery included both upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). Each residual disease threshold is considered as a separate prognostic factor. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 8), MEDLINE via Ovid (to 30 August 2021) and Embase via Ovid (to 30 August 2021). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included survival data from studies of at least 100 women with advanced EOC after primary surgery. Residual disease was assessed as a prognostic factor in multivariate prognostic models. We excluded studies that reported fewer than 100 women, women with concurrent malignancies or studies that only reported unadjusted results. Women were included into two distinct groups: those who received PDS followed by platinum-based chemotherapy and those who received IDS, analysed separately. We included studies that reported all RD thresholds after surgery, but the main thresholds of interest were microscopic RD (labelled NMRD), RD 0.1 cm to 1 cm (small-volume residual disease (SVRD)) and RD > 1 cm (large-volume residual disease (LVRD)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we synthesised the data in meta-analysis. To assess the adequacy of adjustment factors used in multivariate Cox models, we used the 'adjustment for other prognostic factors' and 'statistical analysis and reporting' domains of the quality in prognosis studies (QUIPS) tool. We also made judgements about the certainty of the evidence for each outcome in the main comparisons, using GRADE. We examined differences between FIGO stages III and IV for different thresholds of RD after primary surgery. We considered factors such as age, grade, length of follow-up, type and experience of surgeon, and type of surgery in the interpretation of any heterogeneity. We also performed sensitivity analyses that distinguished between studies that included NMRD in RD categories of < 1 cm and those that did not. This was applicable to comparisons involving RD < 1 cm with the exception of RD < 1 cm versus NMRD. We evaluated women undergoing PDS and IDS in separate analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We found 46 studies reporting multivariate prognostic analyses, including RD as a prognostic factor, which met our inclusion criteria: 22,376 women who underwent PDS and 3697 who underwent IDS, all with varying levels of RD. While we identified a range of different RD thresholds, we mainly report on comparisons that are the focus of a key area of clinical uncertainty (involving NMRD, SVRD and LVRD). The comparison involving any visible disease (RD > 0 cm) and NMRD was also important. SVRD versus NMRD in a PDS setting In PDS studies, most showed an increased risk of death in all RD groups when those with macroscopic RD (MRD) were compared to NMRD. Women who had SVRD after PDS had more than twice the risk of death compared to women with NMRD (hazard ratio (HR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 2.29; I2 = 50%; 17 studies; 9404 participants; moderate-certainty). The analysis of progression-free survival found that women who had SVRD after PDS had nearly twice the risk of death compared to women with NMRD (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.16; I2 = 63%; 10 studies; 6596 participants; moderate-certainty). LVRD versus SVRD in a PDS setting When we compared LVRD versus SVRD following surgery, the estimates were attenuated compared to NMRD comparisons. All analyses showed an overall survival benefit in women who had RD < 1 cm after surgery (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.32; I2 = 0%; 5 studies; 6000 participants; moderate-certainty). The results were robust to analyses of progression-free survival. SVRD and LVRD versus NMRD in an IDS setting The one study that defined the categories as NMRD, SVRD and LVRD showed that women who had SVRD and LVRD after IDS had more than twice the risk of death compared to women who had NMRD (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.66; 310 participants; I2 = 56%, and HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.34; 343 participants; I2 = 35%; very low-certainty, for SVRD versus NMRD and LVRD versus NMRD, respectively). LVRD versus SVRD + NMRD in an IDS setting Meta-analysis found that women who had LVRD had a greater risk of death and disease progression compared to women who had either SVRD or NMRD (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.11; 6 studies; 1572 participants; I2 = 58% for overall survival and HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.52; 1145 participants; I2 = 60% for progression-free survival; very low-certainty). However, this result is biased as in all but one study it was not possible to distinguish NMRD within the < 1 cm thresholds. Only one study separated NMRD from SVRD; all others included NMRD in the SVRD group, which may create bias when comparing with LVRD, making interpretation challenging. MRD versus NMRD in an IDS setting Women who had any amount of MRD after IDS had more than twice the risk of death compared to women with NMRD (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.29, I2 = 81%; 906 participants; very low-certainty). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In a PDS setting, there is moderate-certainty evidence that the amount of RD after primary surgery is a prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survival in women with advanced ovarian cancer. We separated our analysis into three distinct categories for the survival outcome including NMRD, SVRD and LVRD. After IDS, there may be only two categories required, although this is based on very low-certainty evidence, as all but one study included NMRD in the SVRD category. The one study that separated NMRD from SVRD showed no improved survival outcome in the SVRD category, compared to LVRD. Further low-certainty evidence also supported restricting to two categories, where women who had any amount of MRD after IDS had a significantly greater risk of death compared to women with NMRD. Therefore, the evidence presented in this review cannot conclude that using three categories applies in an IDS setting (very low-certainty evidence), as was supported for PDS (which has convincing moderate-certainty evidence)."

                "title": "Effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy in comparison to other psychological and pharmacological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in women diagnosed with postpartum depression in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review.",
                "abstract": "Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a condition that can affect any woman regardless of ethnicity, age, party, marital status, income, and type of delivery. This condition is highly prevalent worldwide. PPD, if not treated timely, can affect the maternal-child bond and can have a detrimental impact on the future cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development of the child. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has been reported as an effective treatment of PPD in previous studies as this focuses on relationship and social support issues. Previous reviews conducted in developed nations have reported the superior efficacy of IPT in comparison to other treatment options. There is no systematic review conducted in low to middle-income countries on the efficacy of IPT on PPD. Therefore it was necessary to undertake a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of IPT in reducing the depression among postpartum women in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objectives: The main aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of IPT alone or in conjunction with pharmacological therapy and/or other psychological and psychosocial interventions, in reducing depressive symptoms among women diagnosed with PPD residing in LMICs. Search Methods: The systematic search encompassed several prominent databases and grey literature. Furthermore, experts specializing in the field of IPT were consulted to identify any relevant studies conducted in LMICs that fulfilled the predetermined eligibility criteria. The most recent search update was performed in July 2022. Selection Criteria: The PICOS criteria were meticulously defined for this review as described. Participants: Postpartum women diagnosed with PPD in LMICs were included. Intervention: IPT either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with pharmacological therapy was included. Comparison: any form of psychological therapy or pharmacological therapy, whether administered individually or in combination, was considered for comparison. Study designs: experimental and quasi-experimental, factorial designs, and quantitative components (experimental, quasi-experimental, factorial designs) of mixed methods designs were eligible to be included. Studies with single-group study designs and qualitative studies were excluded from the review. Data Collection and Analysis: Two reviewers from our team conducted a rigorous screening process to determine the eligibility of articles for inclusion. This involved an initial evaluation of titles and abstracts, followed by a comprehensive assessment of the full text of selected articles. In instances where discrepancies arose between the two reviewers, resolution was achieved through discussion or consultation with a third author to establish a consensus. Following the screening process, two team members independently extracted pertinent information and data from the studies that met the inclusion criteria. The treatment effect of the intervention, in comparison to the control group, was subsequently analyzed utilizing the fixed effects model taking into account the small number of studies. Main Results: A total of 17,588 studies were identified from various databases, and 6493 duplicate studies were removed. Subsequently, 9380 studies underwent independent title and abstract screening resulting in the exclusion of 9040 studies. 345 full texts were thoroughly assessed leading to the exclusion of 341 studies, finally including 4 studies for review. The four included trials were randomized trials and comprised a total sample size of 188 women diagnosed with PPD residing in LMICs. Among these studies, three compared IPT with usual treatment, while one study compared IPT with antidepressant medications (ADMs). In terms of the providers of IPT, in one study, IPT was administered by nurses, while psychologists delivered IPT in another study. In one study, community health workers were responsible for providing IPT. However, in one study, information regarding the specific providers of IPT was not available or reported. The primary outcome measure reported in all four studies was depression, assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The geographical distribution of the studies included; one conducted in Zambia, one in Kenya, one in Pakistan, and one in Iran. Out of the four studies, three were included in the meta-analysis, as missing data from one study could not be obtained. Based on the overall treatment effect, it was found that depression scores decreased significantly more in the IPT group compared to other interventions (usual treatment or ADMs) (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] (-1.01, -0.23), Z\u2009=\u20093.13 (p\u2009=\u20090.002), \u03c7 2\u2009=\u200949.49; df\u2009=\u20092; p\u2009<\u20090.00001; I 2\u2009=\u200996%; 3 studies, n\u2009=\u2009136). Out of the three studies, two studies compared the effectiveness of IPT in reducing depression scores specifically when compared to the usual treatment, and in both studies, depression scores were reduced significantly in the IPT group as compared to the usual treatment group. Only one study directly compared the effectiveness of IPT with ADM, reporting that IPT was more effective than ADM in reducing depression scores among postpartum women. Regarding adverse outcomes, only one study reported suicidal ideation with one participant in the IPT group and two in the ADM group (RR 0.50, 95% CI (0.05, 5.30), p\u2009=\u20090.56, n\u2009=\u200978). The same study reported seven participants in the ADM group had adverse drug reactions as compared to none in the IPT group (RR 15.0, 95% CI (0.89, 254), p\u2009=\u20090.06, n\u2009=\u200978). Authors' Conclusions: Our comprehensive search yielded a limited number of four studies conducted in such settings. Despite the scarcity of available evidence, the findings collectively suggest that IPT is indeed an effective treatment for reducing PPD when compared to usual treatment and pharmacological therapy. However given the low certainty of evidence, there is a need for further research in the form of well-designed randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and a reduced risk of bias. Such studies would greatly contribute to enhancing the strength and reliability of the evidence base regarding the effectiveness of IPT in the context of PPD in LMICs. The knowledge generated from future research endeavors would be highly valuable in guiding the development of more affordable and cost-effective treatment approaches for PPD in resource-limited settings."

                "abstract": "A common impairment in aging is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), which manifests as impaired spectrotemporal processing. Presbycusis can be caused by a dysfunction of the peripheral and central auditory system, and these dysfunctions might differ between the sexes. To date, the circuit mechanisms in the central nervous system responsible for age-related auditory dysfunction remain mostly unknown. In the auditory cortex (ACtx), aging is accompanied by alteration in normal inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission and changes in excitatory (NMDA and AMPA) synapses, but which circuits are affected has been unclear. Here we investigated how auditory cortical microcircuits change with age and if sex-dependent differences existed. We performed laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer (L) 2/3 cells in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in young adult (2-3\u2005months) and aged (older than 18\u2005months) male and female CBA/CaJ mice which have normal peripheral hearing. We found that L2/3 cells in aged male animals display functional hypoconnectivity of inhibitory circuits originating from L2/3 and L4. Compared with cells from young adult mice, cells from aged male mice have weaker excitatory connections from L2/3. We also observed an increased diversity of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. These results suggest a sex-specific reduction and diversification in excitatory and inhibitory intralaminar cortical circuits in aged mice compared with young adult animals. We speculate that these unbalanced changes in cortical circuits contribute to the functional manifestations of age-related hearing loss in both males and females."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: (1) To characterize changes in brainstem neural activity following unilateral deafening in an animal model. (2) To compare brainstem neural activity from unilaterally deafened animals with that of normal-hearing controls. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective controlled animal study. SETTING: Vivarium and animal research facilities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effect of single-sided deafness on brainstem activity was studied in Chinchilla lanigera. Animals were unilaterally deafened via gentamycin injection into the middle ear, which was verified by loss of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Animals underwent measurement of ABR and local field potential in the inferior colliculus. RESULTS: Four animals underwent chemical deafening, with 2 normal-hearing animals as controls. ABRs confirmed unilateral loss of auditory function. Deafened animals demonstrated symmetric local field potential responses that were distinctly different than the contralaterally dominated responses of the inferior colliculus seen in normal-hearing animals. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed a model for unilateral deafness to investigate effects of single-sided deafness on brainstem plasticity. This preliminary investigation serves as a foundation for more comprehensive studies that will include cochlear implantation and manipulation of binaural cues, as well as functional behavioral tests."

                "abstract": "We have investigated the effects of sensorineural hearing loss on the cochlea and central auditory system of profoundly deafened cats. Seventeen adult cats were used: four had normal hearing; 12 were deafened neonatally for periods of < 2.5 years (five bilaterally, seven unilaterally); and one animal had a long-term (approximately 8 years) profound bilateral hearing loss. Bipolar scala tympani stimulating electrodes were bilaterally implanted in each animal, and electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs) were recorded in an acute study to evaluate the basic physiologic response properties of the deafened auditory pathway. The cochleae and cochlear nuclei (CN) of each animal were examined with light microscopy. Spiral ganglion cell density in neonatally deafened cochleae was 17% of normal, and only 1.5% of normal in the long-term deaf animal. There was a 46% reduction in total CN volume in neonatally deafened animals compared to normal, and a 60% reduction in the long-term deaf animal. Neural density in the anteroventral CN of bilaterally deafened animals was 37% higher than normal; 44% higher in the long-term deaf animal. Significantly, however, we saw no evidence of a loss of neurones within the anteroventral CN in any deafened animal. There was a significant increase in EABR threshold and wave IV latency in the deafened animals, and a significant decrease in response amplitude and input/output function gradient. Again, these changes were more extensive in the long-term deaf animal. These data show that a sensorineural hearing loss can evoke significant morphological and physiological changes within the cochlea and auditory brainstem, and these changes become greater with duration of deafness. It remains to be seen whether these changes can be reversed following the introduction of afferent activity via chronic electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve."

                "abstract": "Worldwide, almost 500\u202fmillion people are hearing impaired, making hearing loss the most common sensory impairment among humans. For people with single-sided deafness (SSD), cochlear implants (CIs) can be enormously beneficial by providing binaural information. However, binaural benefits in CI users have been only incompletely realized. Overcoming these limitations requires a better knowledge of how neuronal circuits adapt to SSD and how unilateral CI stimulation can compensate a deaf ear. We investigated effects of neonatal SSD on auditory brainstem circuitry using acoustic (AS), electric (ES), or acoustic stimulation on one ear and electric stimulation on the other ear (AS\u202f+\u202fES). The molecular marker Fos was used to investigate changes in interneuronal communication due to SSD. To induce SSD, neonatal rats obtained a unilateral intracochlear injection of neomycin. In adulthood, rats were acutely stimulated by AS, ES, or AS\u202f+\u202fES. AS and ES were applied correspondingly in terms of intracochlear stimulation side and intensity resulting in bilaterally comparable Fos expression in hearing rats. In contrast, SSD rats showed a loss of tonotopic order along the deafened pathway, indicated by a massive increase and spread of Fos expressing neurons. We report three major results: First, AS of the hearing ear of SSD rats resulted in bilateral activation of neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN). Second, ES of the deaf ear did not activate contralateral CN. Third, AS\u202f+\u202fES of SSD rats resulted in bilateral reduced Fos expression in the auditory brainstem compared to monaural stimulations. These findings indicate changes in inhibitory interactions among neuronal networks as a result of monaural deafness."

                "abstract": "As implantation criteria are broadening to include children with asymmetric hearing loss, it is important to determine the degree of residual hearing needed to protect the bilateral auditory pathways for binaural hearing and whether there is a sensitive period in development for implantation in these children. We have been studying these questions in a growing cohort of children. In the present study, auditory brainstem responses were recorded in 21 children who had 2.2 \u00b1 2.2 years of bimodal hearing. Responses were evoked by 11-Hz acoustic clicks presented to the non-implanted ear and with biphasic electric pulses presented to the implanted ear. Twelve of these children also completed a behavioural task in which they were asked to which side of their heads bilaterally presented clicks/pulses that varied in interaural level or timing lateralized. All children experienced a delay in the non-implanted ear that resulted in 2.0 \u00b1 0.35 ms longer peak latencies. These were further prolonged in 7 children as measured by longer interwave latencies from this ear than from the implanted ear. Despite large asymmetries in timing of brainstem activity between the two ears, all children perceived changes in interaural level differences. They were unable to detect differences in interaural timing cues. Symmetric brainstem function suggests bilateral development was preserved in some children. Future work will explore whether these children have better potential for developing binaural hearing using bimodal input."

                "title": "Single-sided deafness leads to unilateral aural preference within an early sensitive period.",
                "abstract": "Unilateral deafness has a high incidence in children. In addition to children who are born without hearing in one ear, children with bilateral deafness are frequently equipped only with one cochlear implant, leaving the other ear deaf. The present study investigates the effects of such single-sided deafness during development in the congenitally deaf cat. The investigated animals were either born with unilateral deafness or received a cochlear implant in one ear and were subjected to chronic monaural stimulation. In chronically stimulated animals, implantation ages were at the following three critical developmental points: 'early' during the peak of functional cortical synaptogenesis in deaf animals; 'intermediate' at the age when synaptic activity in the deaf cats dropped to the level of hearing control cats and finally, 'late' at the age when the evoked synaptic activity fell below the level of hearing control cats. After periods of unilateral hearing, local field potentials were recorded from the cortical surface using a microelectrode at \u223c100 recording positions. Stimulation was with cochlear implants at both ears. The measures evaluated were dependent only on the symmetry of aural input: paired differences of onset latencies and paired relations of peak amplitudes of local field potentials. A massive reorganization of aural preference in favour of the hearing ear was found in these measures if the onset of unilateral hearing was early (before or around the peak of functional synaptogenesis). The effect was reduced if onset of unilateral hearing was in the intermediate period, and it disappeared if the onset was late. In early onset of unilateral deafness, the used ear became functionally dominant with respect to local field potential onset latency and amplitude. This explains the inferior outcome of implantations at the second-implanted ear compared with first-implanted ear in children. However, despite a central disadvantage for the deaf ear, it still remained capable of activating the auditory cortex. Appropriate training may thus help to improve the performance at the second-implanted ear. In conclusion, periods of monaural stimulation should be kept as short as possible, and training focused on the deaf ear should be introduced after delayed second implantation in children."

                "abstract": "AIMS: Auditory plasticity in response to unilateral deafness has been reported in various animal species. Subcortical changes occurring in unilaterally deaf young dogs using the brainstem auditory evoked response have not been evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to assess the brainstem auditory evoked response findings in dogs with unilateral hearing loss, and compare them with recordings obtained from healthy dogs. METHODS: Brainstem auditory evoked responses (amplitudes and latencies of waves I, II, III, V, the V/I wave amplitude ratio, wave I-V, I-III and III-V interpeak intervals) were studied retrospectively in forty-six privately owned dogs, which were either unilaterally deaf or had bilateral hearing. The data obtained from the hearing ears in unilaterally deaf dogs were compared to values obtained from their healthy littermates. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the amplitude of wave III and the V/I wave amplitude ratio at 75\u00a0dB nHL were found between the group of unilaterally deaf puppies and the control group. The recordings of dogs with single-sided deafness were compared, and the results showed no statistically significant differences in the latencies and amplitudes of the waves between left- (AL) and right-sided (AR) deafness. CONCLUSIONS: The recordings of the brainstem auditory evoked response in canines with unilateral inborn deafness in this study varied compared to recordings from healthy dogs. Future studies looking into electrophysiological assessment of hearing in conjunction with imaging modalities to determine subcortical auditory plasticity and auditory lateralization in unilaterally deaf dogs are warranted."

                "abstract": "Cochlear prostheses for electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (\"electrical hearing\") can provide auditory capacity for profoundly deaf adults and children, including in many cases a restored ability to perceive speech without visual cues. A fundamental challenge in auditory neuroscience is to understand the neural and perceptual mechanisms that make rehabilitation of hearing possible in these deaf humans. We have developed a feline behavioral model that allows us to study behavioral and physiological variables in the same deaf animals. Cats deafened by injection of ototoxic antibiotics were implanted with either a monopolar round window electrode or a multichannel scala tympani electrode array. To evaluate the effects of perceptually significant electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve on the central auditory system, an animal was trained to avoid a mild electrocutaneous shock when biphasic current pulses (0.2 ms/phase) were delivered to its implanted cochlea. Psychophysical detection thresholds and electrical auditory brain stem response (EABR) thresholds were estimated in each cat. At the conclusion of behavioral testing, acute physiological experiments were conducted, and threshold responses were recorded for single neurons and multineuronal clusters in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and the primary auditory cortex (A1). Behavioral and neurophysiological thresholds were evaluated with reference to cochlear histopathology in the same deaf cats. The results of the present study include: 1) in the cats implanted with a scala tympani electrode array, the lowest ICC and A1 neural thresholds were virtually identical to the behavioral thresholds for intracochlear bipolar stimulation; 2) behavioral thresholds were lower than ICC and A1 neural thresholds in each of the cats implanted with a monopolar round window electrode; 3) EABR thresholds were higher than behavioral thresholds in all of the cats (mean difference = 6.5 dB); and 4) the cumulative number of action potentials for a sample of ICC neurons increased monotonically as a function of the amplitude and the number of stimulating biphasic pulses. This physiological result suggests that the output from the ICC may be integrated spatially across neurons and temporally integrated across pulses when the auditory nerve array is stimulated with a train of biphasic current pulses. Because behavioral thresholds were lower and reaction times were faster at a pulse rate of 30 pps compared with a pulse rate of 2 pps, spatial-temporal integration in the central auditory system was presumably reflected in psychophysical performance."

                "abstract": "Individuals with sudden unilateral deafness offer a unique opportunity to study plasticity of the binaural auditory system in adult humans. Stimulation of the intact ear results in increased activity in the auditory cortex. However, there are no reports of changes at sub-cortical levels in humans. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate changes in sub-cortical activity immediately before and after the onset of surgically induced unilateral deafness in adult humans. Click-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to stimulation of the healthy ear were recorded from ten adults during the course of translabyrinthine surgery for the removal of a unilateral acoustic neuroma. This surgical technique always results in abrupt deafferentation of the affected ear. The results revealed a rapid (within minutes) reduction in latency of wave V (mean pre\u2009=\u20096.55\u00a0ms; mean post\u2009=\u20096.15\u00a0ms; p\u2009<\u20090.001). A latency reduction was also observed for wave III (mean pre\u2009=\u20094.40\u00a0ms; mean post\u2009=\u20094.13\u00a0ms; p\u2009<\u20090.001). These reductions in response latency are consistent with functional changes including disinhibition or/and more rapid intra-cellular signalling affecting binaurally sensitive neurons in the central auditory system. The results are highly relevant for improved understanding of putative physiological mechanisms underlying perceptual disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. "

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In recent years, cochlear implants have been applied successfully for the treatment of unilateral hearing loss with quite surprising benefit. One reason for this successful treatment, including the relief from tinnitus, could be the normalization of spontaneous activity in the central auditory pathway because of the electrical stimulation. The present study, therefore, investigated at a cellular level, the effect of a unilateral chronic intracochlear stimulation on key structures of the central auditory pathway. DESIGN: Normal-hearing guinea pigs were mechanically single-sided deafened through a standard HiFocus1j electrode array (on a HiRes 90k cochlear implant) being inserted into the first turn of the cochlea. Four to five electrode contacts could be used for the stimulation. Six weeks after surgery, the speech processor (Auria) was fitted, based on tNRI values and mounted on the animal's back. The two experimental groups were stimulated 16\u200ahours per day for 90 days, using a HiRes strategy based on different stimulation rates (low rate (275\u200apps/ch), high rate (5000\u200apps/ch)). The results were compared with those of unilateral deafened controls (implanted but not stimulated), as well as between the treatment groups. All animals experienced a standardized free field auditory environment. RESULTS: The low-rate group showed a significantly lower average spontaneous activity bilaterally in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and the medial geniculate body than the controls. However, there was no difference in the inferior colliculus and the primary auditory cortex. Spontaneous activity of the high-rate group was also reduced bilaterally in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and in the primary auditory cortex. No differences could be observed between the high-rate group and the controls in the contra-lateral inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body. The high-rate group showed bilaterally a higher activity in the CN and the MGB compared with the low-rate group, whereas in the IC and in the AC a trend for an opposite effect could be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral intracochlear electrical stimulation seems to facilitate the homeostasis of the network activity, since it decreases the spontaneous activity that is usually elevated upon deafferentiation. The electrical stimulation per se seems to be responsible for the bilateral changes described above, rather than the particular nature of the electrical stimulation (e.g., rate). The normalization effects of electrical stimulation found in the present study are of particular importance in cochlear implant recipients with single-sided deafness."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We undertook an animal study to investigate the functional and histological changes that occur in the normal hearing ear of following acoustic trauma. METHODS: As an animal model of unilateral hearing loss, the right ears of CBA mice were deafened by cochlear destruction at 6 weeks of age (SSD group). The control groups included mice that underwent a sham surgery, and mice that were exposed to noise binaurally and monaurally (by plugging the right ear completely). At 10 weeks of age, all mice were exposed to acoustic trauma (110 dB sound pressure level for 1 hour) that induced a transient threshold shift (TTS). Changes in the hearing thresholds of the left ear were assessed over the next 4 weeks by measuring the auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). RESULTS: Following the noise exposure, the SSD group showed a permanent threshold shift (PTS) of about 10 dB, whereas the other groups showed full recovery from the TTS. The threshold of the DPOAEs of the left ears were increased after noise exposure but returned to normal in all groups, with no significant differences among the groups. Histological evaluation showed no apparent cellular loss or apoptosis in the left ears of all groups, including the SSD group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that normal hearing ears are more vulnerable to acoustic trauma following contralateral unilateral cochlear ablation. This increased vulnerability may be due to damaged neural structures."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cochlear implantation for single-sided deafness (SSD) is the only treatment option with the potential to restore binaural hearing cues. Significant binaural benefit has been measured in adults by speech in noise and localisation tests, who receive a cochlear implant for SSD, however, little is known on the cortical changes that help provide this benefit. In the present study, detection of sound in the auditory cortex, speech testing and localisation was used to investigate the ability of a cochlear implant (CI) to restore auditory cortical latencies and improve binaural benefit in the adult SSD population. METHODS: Twenty-nine adults with acquired single-sided deafness who received a CI in adulthood were studied. Speech perception in noise was tested using the Bamford-Kowal-Bench speech-in-noise test, localisation ability was measured using the auditory speech sounds evaluation (A\u03b4E) localisation test and cortical auditory evoked responses, comparing N1-P2 latencies recorded from the normal hearing ear and cochlear implant were used to investigate the synchrony of the cortical pathway from the CI and normal hearing ear (NHe) with binaural hearing function. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in speech perception in noise in all spatial configurations S0/N0 (Z = -3.066, p<0.002), S0/NHE (Z = -4.031, p<0.001), SCI/NHE (Z = -3.851, p<0.001). Localization significantly improved when tested with the cochlear implant on (p<0.001) with a shorter duration of deafness correlating to a greater improvement in localisation ability F(1:18) = 6.854; p = 0.017). There was no significant difference in N1-P2 latency recorded from the normal hearing ear and the CI. CONCLUSION: Cortical auditory evoked response latencies recorded from the CI and NHe showed no significant difference, indicating that the detection of sound in the auditory cortex occurred simultaneously, providing the cortex with auditory information for binaural hearing."

                "abstract": "Aim of this study was to induce a single-sided deafness (SSD) in rats before hearing onset. Rats were operated at postnatal day 10 by approaching the tympanic cavity along a retroauricular path without manipulating ossicles or tympanic membrane. The ototoxic aminoglycoside neomycin was injected intracochlearly through the round window membrane on one side. When the animals have reached young adult stages, their hearing threshold was determined by their auditory brainstem response (ABR). Monaural deafening was considered successful when the hearing threshold was at least 95\u00a0dB above the threshold of the normal hearing ear. Growing up with one non-functional ear, rats developed a striking anatomical asymmetry of their cochlear nuclei (CN). The CN from age-matched normal hearing brains and from both sides of single-sided deaf brains were cut into series of frontal sections and their volumes calculated. No difference was detected between the volume of the normal hearing CN and the contralateral CN in SSD rats. By contrast, growth retardation was found for the ventral CN on the deaf side to result in a volume of only 57% compared to the normal hearing side. Marginal growth retardation was also observed for the dorsal CN on the deaf side. Thus, loss of sensory activation leads mainly, but not exclusively, to a reduction of tissue volume in the ventral CN of the deaf side, leaving the contralateral side apparently unaffected. "

To examine the functional effects of long-term profound deafness on the development of the auditory system, the response properties of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) to electrical stimulation of the cochlea were investigated in chinchillas (i) deaf from birth and (ii) deafened as adults. In animals deafened as adults there was a 50% reduction in the number of neurons activated by electrical stimulation of the cochlea, compared with studies in normal controls. In contrast, very few or no responses could be elicited from IC of animals made deaf from birth. The results imply that lack of neural activity in the ascending auditory pathways from an early stage of development results in an inactivation of IC neurons.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Binaural interaction can be investigated using auditory evoked potentials. A binaural interaction component can be derived from the auditory brainstem response (ABR-BIC) and is considered evidence for binaural interaction at the level of the brainstem. Although click ABR-BIC has been investigated thoroughly, data on 500 Hz tone-burst (TB) ABR-BICs are scarce. In this study, characteristics of click and 500 Hz TB ABR-BICs are described. Furthermore, reliability of both click and 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC are investigated. METHODS: Eighteen normal hearing young adults (eight women, ten men) were included. ABRs were recorded in response to clicks and 500 Hz TBs. ABR-BICs were derived by subtracting the binaural response from the sum of the monaural responses measured in opposite ears. RESULTS: Good inter-rater reliability is obtained for both click and 500 Hz TB ABR-BICs. The most reliable peak in click ABR-BIC occurs at a mean latency of 6.06 ms (SD 0.354 ms). Reliable 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC are obtained with a mean latency of 9.47 ms (SD 0.678 ms). Amplitudes are larger for 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC than for clicks. CONCLUSION: The most reliable peak in click ABR-BIC occurs at the downslope of wave V. Five hundred Hertz TB ABR-BIC is characterized by a broad positivity occurring at the level of wave V. SIGNIFICANCE: The ABR-BIC is a useful technique to investigate binaural interaction in certain populations. Examples are bilateral hearing aid users, bilateral cochlear implant users and bimodal listeners. The latter refers to the combination of unilateral cochlear implantation and contralateral residual hearing. The majority of these patients have residual hearing in the low frequencies. The current study suggests that 500 Hz TB ABR-BIC may be a suitable technique to assess binaural interaction in this specific population of cochlear implant users."

                "abstract": "Response properties of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) were examined in control and profoundly deafened animals to electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Seven adult cats were used: two controls; four neonatally deafened (2 bilaterally, 2 unilaterally); and one long-term bilaterally deaf cat. All control cochleae were deafened immediately before recording to avoid electrophonic activation of hair cells. Histological analysis of neonatally deafened cochleae showed no evidence of hair cells and a moderate to severe spiral ganglion cell loss, whereas the long-term deaf animal had only 1-2% ganglion cell survival. Under barbiturate anesthesia, scala tympani electrodes were implanted bilaterally and the auditory nerve electrically stimulated using 100 micros/phase biphasic current pulses. Single-unit (n = 419) recordings were made through the lateral (LN) and central (ICC) nuclei of the IC; responses could be elicited readily in all animals. Approximately 80% of cells responded to contralateral stimulation, whereas nearly 75% showed an excitatory response to ipsilateral stimulation. Most units showed a monotonic increase in spike probability and reduction in latency and jitter with increasing current. Nonmonotonic activity was seen in 15% of units regardless of hearing status. Neurons in the LN exhibited longer latencies (10-25 ms) compared with those in the ICC (5-8 ms). There was a deafness-induced increase in latency, jitter, and dynamic range; the extent of these changes was related to duration of deafness. The ICC maintained a rudimentary cochleotopic organization in all neonatally deafened animals, suggesting that this organization is laid down during development in the absence of normal afferent input. Temporal resolution of IC neurons was reduced significantly in neonatal bilaterally deafened animals compared with acutely deafened controls, whereas neonatal unilaterally deafened animals showed no reduction. It would appear that monaural afferent input is sufficient to maintain normal levels of temporal resolution in auditory midbrain neurons. These experiments have shown that many of the basic response properties are similar across animals with a wide range of auditory experience. However, important differences were identified, including increased response latencies and temporal jitter, and reduced levels of temporal resolution."

                "abstract": "The interaural time difference (ITD) is an important cue for the localization of sounds. ITD changes as little as 10\u00a0\u03bcs can be detected by the human auditory system. By provision of one ear with a cochlear implant (CI) ITD are altered due to the partial replacement of the peripheral auditory system. A hearing aid (HA), in contrast, does not replace but adds a processing delay component to the peripheral auditory system extending ITD. The aim of the present study was to quantify interaural stimulation timing between these different modalities to estimate the need for central auditory temporal compensation in single sided deaf CI users or bimodal CI/HA users. For this purpose, wave V latencies of auditory brainstem responses evoked either acoustically (ABR) or electrically via the CI (EABR) have been measured. The sum of delays consisting of CI signal processing measured in the MED-EL OPUS2 audio processor and EABR wave V latencies evoked on different intracochlear sites allowed an estimation of the entire CI channel-specific delay for MED-EL MAESTRO CI systems. We compared these values with ABR wave V latencies measured in the contralateral normal hearing or HA provided ear in different frequency bands. The results showed that EABR wave V latencies were consistently shorter than those evoked acoustically in the unaided normal hearing ear. Thus, artificial delays within the audio processor can be implemented to adjust interaural stimulation timing. The currently implemented group delays in the MED-EL CI system turned out to be reasonably similar to those of the unaided ear. For adjustment of CI and contralateral HA, in contrast, an adjustable additional across-frequency delay in the range of 1-11\u00a0ms implemented in the CI would be required. Especially for bimodal CI/HA users the adjustment of interaural stimulation timing may induce improved binaural hearing, reduced need for central auditory temporal compensation and increased acceptance of the CI/HA provision.

RESULTS: In these subjects, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and cochlear microphonics remain normal while auditory brain stem evoked potential (ABR) thresholds are significantly elevated. However, in the same subjects, central auditory neurons (in the inferior colliculus) have response thresholds that are considerably lower (by up to 50 dB) than ABR thresholds. These findings parallel the characteristics of auditory neuropathy in humans, in which absent or abnormal ABRs are recorded in patients with only mild to moderate audiometric thresholds and preserved OAEs. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that scattered inner haircell lesions also can result from long-term cochlear hypoxia, and we propose that this is a likely candidate for the etiology of many types of auditory neuropathy in human subjects."

NEW METHOD: This paper describes the design and surgical implantation of a multichannel cochlear implant (CI) system for chronic use in the free-moving gerbil. For chronic stimulation, adult-deafened gerbils were connected to a multichannel commutator that allowed low resistance cable rotation and stable electric connectivity to the current source. RESULTS: Despite the small scale of the gerbil cochlea and auditory brain regions, final electrophysiological mapping experiments revealed selective and tonotopically organized neuronal activation in the auditory cortex. Contact impedances and electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses were stable over several weeks demonstrating the long-term integrity of the implant and the efficacy of the stimulation. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Most animal models on multichannel signal processing and stimulation-induced plasticity are limited to larger animals such as ferrets, cats and primates. Multichannel CI stimulation in the free-moving rodent and evidence for selective neuronal activation in gerbil auditory cortex have not been previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results show that the gerbil is a robust rodent model for selective and tonotopically organized multichannel CI stimulation. We anticipate that this model provides a useful tool to develop and test both passive stimulation and behavioral training strategies for plastic reorganization and restoration of degraded unilateral and bilateral central auditory signal processing in the hearing impaired and deaf central auditory system."

BACKGROUND: Patients with SSD can be fit with a BAHS positioned on the impaired side. Despite successful outcomes and some reports of spatial hearing capabilities, little data are available regarding the physiologic performance of BAHSs in response to free-field sounds. METHODS: Cochlear microphonics (CMs) were recorded from five chinchillas before and after destruction of one cochlea. A BAHS (Cochlear Baha) was fitted on the deafened side. CM measurements were made in response to tones, with and without the BAHS, to free-field sounds presented ipsilateral to the SSD, on the side of the normal ear, and along the midline. Stimuli were also presented directly through the BAHS and an earphone to generate sounds with interaural time and level differences approximating free-field sounds. RESULTS: With the BAHS, CM thresholds were decreased (re: no BAHS) by approximately 10 dB for sources ipsilateral to the SSD, approximately 14 dB for midline sources, and approximately 5 dB for sources contralateral to the SSD. Changes in CM amplitudes and thresholds were sound location dependent. CM amplitudes were modulated by interaural time and level differences generated by the linear interaction of BAHS and acoustic signals. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that BAHS can provide input to the normal ear that is modulated by sound location, which serves to reduce the head shadow effect and may also offer cues to sound location."

Here we report that Bordetella pseudohinzii, a respiratory pathogen of mice, naturally, efficiently and rapidly ascends the eustachian tubes to colonize the middle ears, causing acute and chronic histopathological changes with progressive decrease in hearing acuity that closely mimics otitis media in humans. Laboratory mice experimentally inoculated intranasally with very low numbers of bacteria consistently have their middle ears colonized and subsequently transmit the bacterium to cage mates. Taking advantage of the specifically engineered and well characterized immune deficiencies available in mice we conducted experiments to uncover different roles of T and B cells in controlling bacterial numbers in the middle ear during chronic OM. The iconic mouse model provides significant advantages for elucidating aspects of host-pathogen interactions in otitis media that are currently not possible using other animal models. This natural model of otitis media permits the study of transmission between hosts, efficient early colonization of the respiratory tract, ascension of the eustachian tube, as well as colonization, pathogenesis and persistence in the middle ear. It also allows the combination of the powerful tools of mouse molecular immunology and bacterial genetics to determine the mechanistic basis for these important processes."

                "abstract": "Acute otitis media (AOM) is commonly caused by bacterial pathobionts of the nasopharynx that ascend the Eustachian tube to cause disease in the middle ears. To model and study the various complexities of AOM, common human otopathogens are injected directly into the middle ear bullae of rodents or are delivered with viral co-infections which contribute to the access to the middle ears in complex and partially understood ways. Here, we present the novel observation that Bordetella bronchiseptica, a well-characterized respiratory commensal/pathogen of mice, also efficiently ascends their Eustachian tubes to colonize their middle ears, providing a flexible mouse model to study naturally occurring AOM. Mice lacking T and/or B cells failed to resolve infections, highlighting the cooperative role of both in clearing middle ear infection. Adoptively transferred antibodies provided complete protection to the lungs but only partially protected the middle ears, highlighting the differences between respiratory and otoimmunology. We present this as a novel experimental system that can capitalize on the strengths of the mouse model to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the generation and function of immunity within the middle ear."

                "abstract": "Chronic otitis media (COM) is the long-term infection and inflammation of the middle ears typically caused by upper respiratory tract pathogens that are able to ascend the Eustachian tube. Our understanding of contributing factors is limited because human otopathogens cannot naturally colonize or persist in the middle ears of mice. We recently described a natural COM in mice caused by Bordetella pseudohinzii and proposed this as an experimental system to study bacterial mechanisms of immune evasion that allow persistent infection of the middle ear. Here we describe a novel pertussis toxin (PTx)-like factor unique to B. pseudohinzii, apparently acquired horizontally, that is associated with its particularly efficient persistence and pathogenesis. The catalytic subunit of this toxin, PsxA, has conserved catalytic sites and substantial predicted structural homology to pertussis toxin catalytic subunit PtxA. Deletion of the gene predicted to encode the catalytic subunit, psxA, resulted in a significant decrease in persistence in the middle ears. The defect was not observed in mice lacking T cells, indicating that PsxA is necessary for persistence only when T cells are present. These results demonstrate the role of a novel putative toxin in the persistence of B. pseudohinzii and its generation of COM. This PsxA-mediated immune evasion strategy may similarly be utilized by human otopathogens, via other PTx-like toxins or alternative mechanisms to disrupt critical T cell functions necessary to clear bacteria from the middle ear. This work demonstrates that this experimental system can allow for the detailed study of general strategies and specific mechanisms that otopathogens use to evade host immune responses to persist in the middle ear to cause COM."

                "abstract": "The efficacy of the adaptive immune system in the middle ear (ME) is well established, but the mechanisms are not as well defined as those of gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts. While cellular elements of the adaptive response have been detected in the MEs following infections (or intranasal immunizations), their specific contributions to protecting the organ against reinfections are unknown. How immune protection mechanisms of the MEs compares with those in the adjacent and attached upper and lower respiratory airways remains unclear. To address these knowledge gaps, we used an established mouse respiratory infection model that we recently showed also involves ME infections. Bordetella bronchiseptica delivered to the external nares of mice in tiny numbers very efficiently infects the respiratory tract and ascends the Eustachian tube to colonize and infect the MEs, where it causes severe but acute inflammation resembling human acute otitis media (AOM). Since this AOM naturally resolves, we here examine the immunological mechanisms that clear infection and protect against subsequent infection, to guide efforts to induce protective immunity in the ME. Our results show that once the MEs are cleared of a primary B. bronchiseptica infection, the convalescent organ is strongly protected from reinfection by the pathogen despite its persistence in the upper respiratory tract, suggesting important immunological differences in these adjacent and connected organs. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells trafficked to the MEs following infection and were necessary to robustly protect against secondary challenge. Intranasal vaccination with heat killed B. bronchiseptica conferred robust protection against infection to the MEs, even though the nasopharynx itself was only partially protected. These data establish the MEs as discrete effector sites of adaptive immunity and shows that effective protection in the MEs and the respiratory tract is significantly different. This model system allows the dissection of immunological mechanisms that can prevent bacteria in the nasopharynx from ascending the ET to colonize the ME."

                "abstract": "Otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear) is one of the most common diseases of early childhood. Susceptibility to otitis is influenced by a number of factors, including the actions of innate immune molecules secreted by the epithelia lining the nasopharynx, middle ear and Eustachian tube. The SPLUNC1 (short palate, lung, nasal epithelial clone 1) protein is a highly abundant secretory product of the mammalian nasal, oral and respiratory mucosa that is thought to play a multifunctional role in host defense. In this study we investigated Splunc1 expression in the ear of the mouse, and examined whether this protein contributes to overall host defense in the middle ear and/or Eustachian tube. We found that Splunc1 is highly expressed in both the surface epithelium and in submucosal glands in these regions in wild-type mice. In mice lacking Splunc1, we noted histologically an increased frequency of otitis media, characterized by the accumulation of leukocytes (neutrophils with scattered macrophages), proteinaceous fluid and mucus in the middle ear lumens. Furthermore, many of these mice had extensive remodeling of the middle ear wall, suggesting a chronic course of disease. From these observations, we conclude that loss of Splunc1 predisposes mice to the development of otitis media. The Splunc1(-/-) mouse model should help investigators to better understand both the biological role of Splunc1 as well as host defense mechanisms in the middle ear. "

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Chronic otitis media is a significant clinical problem. Understanding the mechanisms of chronic otitis media is critical for its control. However, little is known of these processes as a result of lack of animal models of spontaneous otitis media. The C3H/HeJ mouse has a single amino acid substitution in its toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), making it insensitive to endotoxin. As a result, these mice cannot clear Gram-negative bacteria. The chronically inflamed middle ear in this animal provides us the opportunity to study spontaneous chronic otitis media. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Otoscopy and auditory brain response (ABR) evaluation of C3H/HeJ mice at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 months were carried out under sedation. At 12 months of age, mice were killed and histologic analysis of the middle ear, inner ear, and eustachian tube was carried out. RESULTS: Tympanic membrane visualization and ABR thresholds in 7- to 8-month-old C3H/HeJ mice showed that approximately half developed middle and inner ear disease spontaneously. The significant elevation of thresholds suggested a sensorineural component in addition to the conductive loss. Middle and inner ear histology showed some degree of middle and inner ear inflammation in half the mice, paralleling the ABR data. CONCLUSIONS: The histopathologic changes reported here in the C3H/HeJ mouse model of chronic otitis media have been reported in human chronic otitis media. This spontaneous model of chronic otitis media will be valuable for the characterization of middle and inner ear inflammatory disease processes that are induced by middle ear infections."

                "abstract": "Background: The lack of animal models to experimentally study how infectious agents transmit between hosts limits our understanding of what makes some pathogens so contagious. Methods: We recently developed a Bordetella bronchiseptica mouse model to study transmission and have used it to assess, for the first time, which of several well-studied \"virulence factors\" common to classical Bordetella species contribute to transmission. Results: Among 13 mutants screened, a mutant lacking an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) locus consistently failed to transmit. The loss of EPS had no obvious effect on in vitro characteristics of growth, adherence, cytotoxicity, or serum resistance, though it profoundly reduced the ability of the mutant to colonize the lower respiratory tract of mice. While wild-type B. bronchiseptica was shed from colonized mice and efficiently transmitted to cage-mates, the mutant colonized less efficiently, shed at lower numbers, and consequently did not transmit to naive animals. Conclusions: These results have important implications for potential roles of polysaccharides in the pathogenesis and transmission of Bordetella species as well as other respiratory pathogens. Cases of pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis are on the rise, and understanding factors that contribute to their spread is critical to its control."

                "abstract": "Acute otitis media, inflammation of the middle ear, is the most common bacterial infection in children and, as a consequence, is the most common reason for antimicrobial prescription to this age group. There is currently no effective vaccine for the principal pathogen involved, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). The most frequently used and widely accepted experimental animal model of middle ear infection is in chinchillas, but mice and gerbils have also been used. We have established a robust model of middle ear infection by NTHi in the Junbo mouse, a mutant mouse line that spontaneously develops chronic middle ear inflammation in specific pathogen-free conditions. The heterozygote Junbo mouse (Jbo/+) bears a mutation in a gene (Evi1, also known as Mecom) that plays a role in host innate immune regulation; pre-existing middle ear inflammation promotes NTHi middle ear infection. A single intranasal inoculation with NTHi produces high rates (up to 90%) of middle ear infection and bacterial titres (10(4)-10(5) colony-forming units/\u00b5l) in bulla fluids. Bacteria are cleared from the majority of middle ears between day 21 and 35 post-inoculation but remain in approximately 20% of middle ears at least up to day 56 post-infection. The expression of Toll-like receptor-dependent response cytokine genes is elevated in the middle ear of the Jbo/+ mouse following NTHi infection. The translational potential of the Junbo model for studying antimicrobial intervention regimens was shown using a 3 day course of azithromycin to clear NTHi infection, and its potential use in vaccine development studies was shown by demonstrating protection in mice immunized with killed homologous, but not heterologous, NTHi bacteria."

                "abstract": "Otitis media (OM) encompasses a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from the readily identifiable Acute OM (AOM), which is characterised by otalgia and fever, to chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) where impaired hearing due to middle ear effusion may be the only clinical symptom. Chronic suppurative OM (CSOM) presents as a more severe form of OM, involving perforation of the tympanic membrane. The pathogenesis of OM in these varied clinical presentations is unclear but activation of the innate inflammatory responses to viral and/or bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract performs an integral role. This localised inflammatory response can persist even after pathogens are cleared from the middle ear, eustachian tubes and, in the case of respiratory viruses, even the nasal compartment. Children prone to OM may experience an over exuberant inflammatory response that underlies the development of chronic forms of OM and their sequelae, including hearing impairment. Treatments for chronic effusive forms of OM are limited, with current therapeutic guidelines recommending a \"watch and wait\" strategy rather than active treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs. Overall, there is a clear need for more targeted and effective treatments that either prevent or reduce the hyper-inflammatory response associated with chronic forms of OM. Improved treatment options rely upon an in-depth understanding of OM pathogenesis, particularly the role of the host innate immune response during acute OM. In this paper, we review the current literature regarding the innate immune response within the middle ear to bacterial and viral otopathogens alone, and as co-infections. This is an important consideration, as the role of respiratory viruses as primary pathogens in OM is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, increased reporting from PCR-based diagnostics, indicates that viral/bacterial co-infections in the middle ear are more common than bacterial infections alone. Increasingly, the mechanisms by which viral/bacterial co-infections may drive or maintain complex innate immune responses and inflammation during OM as a chronic response require investigation. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic OM, including host innate immune response within the middle ear is vital for development of improved diagnostic and treatment options for our children."

The personal and societal costs for otitis media are significant. Problems arising from antibiotic use have led to considerable animal research efforts to better understand the mechanisms of acute otitis media and to develop new strategies for its prevention and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Various animal models induce acute otitis media from a variety of interventions, including direct injection of whole bacteria or their products into the middle ear. The mouse model has begun to emerge as a model for otitis media. The mouse affords many advantages for in-vivo research, including ease of genetic manipulation, availability of numerous inbred and transgenic strains, and an extensively studied immune system. Experimental reagents for cellular and molecular studies are widely available for the mouse. The mouse is an excellent model for investigating the genetics and molecular bases for otitis media due to the extensive understanding of the mouse genome. SUMMARY: With the increased availability of knockout and transgenic mice, and the large amount of data to indicate that human disease is accurately modeled in the mouse, the mouse model is increasingly becoming a model of choice."

                "abstract": "Otitis media (OM) is one of the most frequent diseases in childhood, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is among the main causative bacterial agents. Since current experimental models used to study the bacterial pathogenesis of OM have several limitations, such as the invasiveness of the experimental procedures, we developed a non-invasive murine OM model. In our model, adapted from a previously developed rat OM model, a pressure cabin is used in which a 40 kPa pressure increase is applied to translocate pneumococci from the nasopharyngeal cavity into both mouse middle ears. Wild-type pneumococci were found to persist in the middle ear cavity for 144 h after infection, with a maximum bacterial load at 96 h. Inflammation was confirmed at 96 and 144 h post-infection by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha cytokine analysis and histopathology. Subsequently, we investigated the contribution of two surface-associated pneumococcal proteins, the streptococcal lipoprotein rotamase A (SlrA) and the putative proteinase maturation protein A (PpmA), to experimental OM in our model. Pneumococci lacking the slrA gene, but not those lacking the ppmA gene, were significantly reduced in virulence in the OM model. Importantly, pneumococci lacking both genes were significantly more attenuated than the DeltaslrA single mutant. This additive effect suggests that SlrA and PpmA exert complementary functions during experimental OM. In conclusion, we have developed a highly reproducible and non-invasive murine infection model for pneumococcal OM using a pressure cabin, which is very suitable to study pneumococcal pathogenesis and virulence in vivo."

Overall, this study provides a clinically relevant and easily accessible animal model to study the pathogenesis and prevention of OM. Moreover, we provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that influenza virus alone causes middle ear inflammation in infant mice.

Oral ingestion of M. bovis-contaminated milk is linked, but not definitively proven, to development of otitis media. In the current study, we demonstrate that oral ingestion of M. bovis infected colostrum can result in an ascending infection and development of otitis media. Importantly, M. bovis was found to have a previously unrecognized tendency for colonization of the tonsils of calves, which most likely contributed to the subsequent development of otitis media. In contrast, transtracheal inoculation failed to produce clinically significant upper respiratory tract disease, although did induce lower respiratory tract disease. The upper respiratory tract was the major site of M. bovis-specific B cell and mucosal IgA responses in calves inoculated by the oral route. The oral inoculation route of infection presented here is particularly suited to the study of host-pathogen interactions during initial colonization of the tonsils, expansion of infection and dissemination to the lower respiratory tract and middle ear. In addition, it could be used to investigate potential new preventative or control strategies, especially those aimed at limiting colonization of the tonsils and/or spread to the middle ear."

We describe the development of a mouse model of transmission of a natural pathogen, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and its use to assess the impact of host immune functions. Although B. bronchiseptica transmits poorly between wild-type mice and mice lacking other immune components, it transmits efficiently between mice deficient in Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4-mutant mice were more susceptible to initial colonization, and poorly controlled pathogen growth and shedding. Heavy neutrophil infiltration distinguished TLR4-deficient responses, and neutrophil depletion did not affect respiratory CFU load, but decreased bacterial shedding. The effect of TLR4 response on transmission may explain the extensive variation in TLR4 agonist potency observed among closely related subspecies of Bordetella. This transmission model will enable mechanistic studies of how pathogens spread from one host to another, the defining feature of infectious disease. "

Among these two triggers are viral infections and upper respiratory tract allergy."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation and infection of the middle ear, known as otitis media (OM), is a leading cause of hearing loss and the most frequently diagnosed disease in children worldwide. Traditionally, mouse models for OM rely on inducing acute infection through inoculation of the middle ear, e.g. with the human otopathogen non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and with very few genetic models with spontaneous or chronic OM. A2ML1 variants, including loss-of-function variants, were associated with susceptibility to OM in humans, but no animal model has been reported for A2ml1-related OM. Here, we report our middle ear findings in a mouse line with a CRISPR-induced knockout (KO) of A2ml1. METHODS: Mice were X-rayed prior to harvest to determine if there are craniofacial or skeletal abnormalities. Tissue from mouse middle ears, as well as other upper respiratory mucosal tissues, were harvested. The harvested middle ear bullae were examined under microscope and submitted for histologic preparation to study phenotypic indications of OM. RNA samples isolated from middle ear tissue were assayed for expression of genes correlated with A2ML1 expression in humans. RESULTS: Data from a total of 119 mice (35 wildtype, 40 heterozygous, 44 homozygous) are presented here, with each analyses being performed on subsets of these mice. There were no significant craniofacial differences by genotype (n\u00a0=\u00a022). Findings in mice with the A2ml1-KO indicated an increased incidence of OM (n=29; odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a011; CI: 1.1, 573.6; Fisher exact two-sided p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) with tympanic membrane perforations or thickening, as well as cases of middle ear effusion, inflammatory cells, or fluid from histologic sections. Dsp was upregulated in the middle ear tissues of homozygous mice (Wilcoxon test p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). CONCLUSION: Thus far, our results in this A2ml1-KO mouse line indicate spontaneous occurrence of OM and dysregulation of Dsp in the middle ear as a potential disease mechanism for A2ml1-related OM."

                "abstract": "Otitis media and otitis media with effusion are among the most common childhood illnesses and contribute a great deal to health care costs. The cause of otitis media is multifactorial. Eustachian tube dysfunction, bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear, and nasal inflammation resulting from allergic rhinitis or upper respiratory infection are acknowledged contributing factors. Data from epidemiology studies indicate that 25% to 40% of upper respiratory infections in children younger than 3 years are accompanied by an episode of otitis media, 40% to 50% of children older than 3 years with chronic otitis media have confirmed allergic rhinitis. Studies of the pathogenesis of otitis media have identified interactions among infection, allergic reactions, and eustachian tube dysfunction. Nasal inflammation due to allergen challenge results in classic signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis and eustachian tube dysfunction. Eustachian tube dysfunction leads to increased negative pressure in the middle ear and improper ventilation. Both viral upper respiratory infection and nasal allergic reaction provoke nasal inflammation, eustachian tube dysfunction, and enhanced nasal protein transudation and secretion, which is likely to be sustained and modulated by inflammatory mediators and cytokines. In a study of experimental infection with influenza A virus, histamine release increased from peripheral blood basophils of patients with allergic rhinitis. These data support an interaction between viral infection and nasal allergy in enhancing certain pathophysiologic responses. Viral upper respiratory infections may promote secondary bacterial infections by altering bacterial adherence, modulating host immune and inflammatory responses, and impairing eustachian tube function. In acute otitis media, bacteria are cultured front approximately 70% of middle ear effusions with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common organism. Initial management of otitis media consists of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In the presence of allergic rhinitis, antiallergic therapies may be used to augment symptom resolution and therapeutic response. Surgical insertion of tympanostomy or ventilation tubes to promote drainage of unresolved effusions has become common. Further delineation of the pathogenesis of otitis media and otitis media with effusion will guide appropriate medical management and may decrease the need and frequency of surgical procedures."

                "abstract": "Inflammation of the middle ear, known clinically as chronic otitis media, presents in different forms, such as chronic otitis media with effusion (COME; glue ear) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). These are highly prevalent diseases, especially in childhood, and lead to significant morbidity worldwide. However, much remains unclear about this disease, including its aetiology, initiation and perpetuation, and the relative roles of mucosal and leukocyte biology, pathogens, and Eustachian tube function. Chronic otitis media is commonly modelled in mice but most existing models only partially mimic human disease and many are syndromic. Nevertheless, these models have provided insights into potential disease mechanisms, and have implicated altered immune signalling, mucociliary function and Eustachian tube function as potential predisposing mechanisms. Clinical studies of chronic otitis media have yet to implicate a particular molecular pathway or mechanism, and current human genetic studies are underpowered. We also do not fully understand how existing interventions, such as tympanic membrane repair, work, nor how chronic otitis media spontaneously resolves. This Clinical Puzzle article describes our current knowledge of chronic otitis media and the existing research models for this condition. It also identifies unanswered questions about its pathogenesis and treatment, with the goal of advancing our understanding of this disease to aid the development of novel therapeutic interventions."

Routine histological and anatomical techniques and procedures were used. The gerbil and chinchilla, although of different sizes, are quite similar, having hypertrophied middle ear bullae, nearly vertical ET, and similar histology including seromucous glands draining directly into the ET. In contrast, the rat has a small bulla, a nearly horizontal ET, and a large concentration of goblet cells but few mucous glands in the ET. It appears that the chinchilla and the gerbil may serve as alternative models for OM research. Chinchillas and gerbils are relatively free of naturally occurring OM, while the rat has a high incidence of naturally occurring OM."

Here we demonstrate that the expression of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is increased in patients with DR and animal models of diabetic eye disease. STING has been previously shown to regulate cell senescence and inflammation, key contributors to the development and progression of DR. To investigate the mechanism whereby STING contributes to the pathogenesis of DR, diabetes was induced in STING-KO mice and STINGGT (loss-of-function mutation) mice, and molecular alterations and pathological changes in the retina were characterized. We report that retinal endothelial cell senescence, inflammation, and capillary degeneration were all inhibited in STING-KO diabetic mice; these observations were independently corroborated in STINGGT mice. These protective effects resulted from the reduction in TBK1, IRF3, and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation in the absence of STING. Collectively, our results suggest that targeting STING may be an effective therapy for the early prevention and treatment of DR."

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most prevalent microvascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus. Previous studies demonstrate that microvascular endothelial inflammation caused by chronic hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DR. However, the detailed mechanisms on how endothelial inflammation contributes to DR are not fully understood. The STING pathway is an important innate immune signaling pathway. Although STING has been implicated in multiple autoimmune and metabolic diseases, it is not clear whether STING is involved in the pathogenesis of DR. Thus, re-analysis of the public single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) data demonstrated that STING was highly expressed in mouse retinal vessels. Moreover, our results demonstrated that STING and p-TBK1 protein levels in retinal endothelial cells are significantly increased in mice fed with high fat diet compared with chow diet. In vitro, palmitic acid treatment on HRVECs induced mitochondrial DNA leakage into the cytosol, and augmented p-TBK1 protein and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels. As STING is localized to the ER, we analyzed the relation between STING activation and ER stress. In HRVECs, STING pathway was shown to be activated under chemical-induced ER stress, but attenuated when IRE1\u03b1 was abolished by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition. Taken together, our findings revealed that STING signaling plays an important role in mediating lipotoxicity-induced endothelial inflammatory and injury, and IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 signaling potentiated STING signaling. Thus, targeting the IRE1\u03b1 or STING pathways to alleviate endothelial inflammation provides candidate therapeutic target for treating DR as well as other microvascular complications."

Furthermore, the cGAS/STING pathway has been reported to be involved in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the correlation between the proinflammatory effect of PCSK9 and the cGAS/STING pathway in DN. We used PCSK9 mAbs to inhibit PCSK9 in vivo and PCSK9 siRNA in vitro and measured the inflammatory phenotype in HFD/STZ-treated mice or HGPA-induced HK-2 cells, and observed decreased blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, UACR, and kidney injury in response to the PCSK9 mAb in HFD/STZ-treated mice. Moreover, IL-1 \u03b2, MCP-1, and TNF-\u03b1 levels were reduced by the PCSK9 mAb in vivo and PCSK9 siRNA in vitro. We observed increased mtDNA damage and activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway during DN, as well as the downstream targets p-TBK1, p-NF-\u03baB p65, and IL-1\u03b2. In a further experiment with an HGPA-induced DN model in HK-2 cells, we revealed that mtDNA damage was increased, which led to the activation of the cGAS/STING system and its downstream targets. Notably, the cGAS-STING signaling pathway was inhibited by the PCSK9 mAb in vivo and PCSK9 siRNA in vitro. In addition, inhibition of STING with C-176 in HGPA-induced HK-2 cells markedly blocked inflammation. In conclusion, we report for the first time that PCSK9 triggers mitochondrial DNA damage and activates the cGAS-STING pathway in DN, which leads to a series of inflammation cascades. PCSK9-targeted intervention can effectively reduce DN inflammation and delay its progression. Moreover, the inhibition of STING significantly abrogated the inflammation triggered by HGPA in HK-2 cells."

However, there are no reports on the status of retinal iron or its implications in the pathogenesis of DR. In the present study, we found that retinas of type-1 and type-2 mouse models of diabetes have increased iron accumulation compared to non-diabetic retinas. We found similar iron accumulation in postmortem retinal samples from human diabetic patients. Further, we induced diabetes in HFE knockout (KO) mice model of genetic iron overload to understand the role of iron in the pathogenesis of DR. We found increased neuronal cell death, vascular alterations and loss of retinal barrier integrity in diabetic HFE KO mice compared to diabetic wildtype mice. Diabetic HFE KO mouse retinas also exhibited increased expression of inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Severity in the pathogenesis of DR in HFE KO mice was accompanied by increase in retinal renin expression mediated by G-protein-coupled succinate receptor GPR91. In light of previous reports implicating retinal renin-angiotensin system in DR pathogenesis, our results reveal a novel relationship between diabetes, iron and renin-angiotensin system, thereby unraveling new therapeutic targets for the treatment of DR."

                "abstract": "The microglia-mediated neuroinflammation have been shown to play a crucial role in the ocular pathological angiogenesis process, but specific immunotherapies for neovascular ocular diseases are still lacking. This study proposed that targeting GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) might be a novel immunotherapy for these angiogenesis diseases. We found a significant upregulation of CGAS and STING genes in the RNA-seq data derived from retinal tissues of the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In experimental models of ocular angiogenesis including laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), the cGAS-STING pathway was activated as angiogenesis progressed. Either genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of STING resulted in a remarkable suppression of neovascularization in both models. Furthermore, cGAS-STING signaling was specifically activated in myeloid cells, triggering the subsequent RIP1-RIP3-MLKL pathway activation and leading to necroptosis-mediated inflammation. Notably, targeted inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway with C-176 or SN-011 could significantly suppress pathological angiogenesis in CNV and OIR. Additionally, the combination of C-176 or SN-011 with anti-VEGF therapy led to least angiogenesis, markedly enhancing the anti-angiogenic effectiveness. Together, our findings provide compelling evidence for the importance of the cGAS-STING-necroptosis axis in pathological angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a promising immunotherapeutic target for treating neovascular ocular diseases."

                "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aseptic inflammatory activation. Mitochondria-derived cytosolic DNA has been reported to induce inflammation by activating cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in the adipose, liver, and kidney tissues. However, the role of cytosolic mtDNA in the progression of DCM is unclear. In this study, with an obesity-related DCM mouse model established by feeding db/db mice with a high-fat diet (HFD), we observed increased mtDNA in the cytosol and activated cGAS-STING signaling pathway during DCM, as well as the downstream targets, IRF3, NF-\u03baB, IL-18, and IL-1\u03b2. In a further study with a palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxic cell model established in H9C2 cells, we revealed that the cytosolic mtDNA was the result of PA-induced overproduction of mitochondrial ROS, which also led to the activation of the cGAS/STING system and its downstream targets. Notably, treatment of extracted mtDNA alone was sufficient to activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in cultured H9C2 cells. Besides, both knockdown of STING in PA-induced H9C2 cells and inhibition of STING by C-176 injection in the DCM mouse model could remarkably block the inflammation and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our study elucidated the critical role of cytosolic mtDNA-induced cGAS-STING activation in the pathogenesis of obesity-related DCM and provided preclinical validation for using a STING inhibitor as a new potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DCM."

Despite significant efforts have been devoted to investigate DR over the years, the molecular mechanisms still remained unclear. Emerging evidences demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) were tightly associated with pathophysiological development of DR. Hence, this study was aimed to illustrate the role and molecular mechanisms of miR-412-5p in progression of DR. Streptozotocin (STZ) treatment in rats and human retinal endothelial cell (HREC) models were used to simulate DR conditions in vivo and in vitro. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to demonstrate the morphology of retinal tissues of rats. Qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detected miR-142-5p and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and immunofluorescence (IF) measured the cell proliferation rates. Western blot tested the expression status of IGF1/IGF1R-mediated signaling pathway. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated the molecular mechanism of miR-142-5p. miR-142-5p level was down-regulated in retinal tissues of DR rats and high glucose (HG)-treated HRECs. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) was identified as a direct target of miR-142-5p. The reduced miR-142-5p level enhanced HRECs proliferation via activating IGF/IGF1R-mediated signaling pathway including p-PI3K, p-ERK, p-AKT, and VEGF activation, ultimately giving rise to cell proliferation. Either miR-142-5p overexpression or IGF1 knockdown alleviated the pathological effects on retinal tissues in DR rats. Collectively, miR-142-5p participated in DR development by targeting IGF1/p-IGF1R signaling pathway and VEGF generation. This miR-142-5p/IGF1/VEGF axis provided a novel therapeutic target for DR clinical treatment."

Chronic hyperglycemia not only promotes the development of diabetes and its complications, but also aggravates the occurrence of senescence. Previous studies have shown that DR is associated with senescence, but the specific mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we first detected the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cellular senescence level of db/db mouse retinas by bulk RNA sequencing. Then, we used single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify the main cell types in the retina and analyzed the DEGs in each cluster. We demonstrated that p53 expression was significantly increased in retinal endothelial cell cluster of db/db mice. Inhibition of p53 can reduce the expression of SA-\u03b2-Gal and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in HRMECs. Finally, we found that p53 can promote FoxO3a ubiquitination and degradation by increasing the expression of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2L6. Overall, our results demonstrate that p53 can accelerate the senescence process of endothelial cells and aggravate the development of DR.

Recently, cellular senescence in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) induced by high glucose has been linked to the pathogenesis of DR. Fluorometholone (FML) is a glucocorticoid drug applied in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic disorders of the eye. The objective of the present study is to investigate the protective function of FML on high glucose-induced cellular senescence in HRECs. The in vitro injury model was established by stimulating HRECs with 30\u00a0mm glucose. After evaluating the cytotoxicity of FML in HRECs, 0.05% and 0.1% FML were used as the optimal concentration in the entire experiment. It was found that the excessive released inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in HRECs induced by high glucose were significantly suppressed by FML, accompanied by the inhibitory effects on the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tissue factor (TF). Declined telomerase activity and enhanced senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity were found in high glucose-challenged HRECs, which were dramatically alleviated by FML, accompanied by the inactivation of the p53/p21 and retinoblastoma (Rb) signaling. Interestingly, FML ameliorated high glucose-induced dephosphorylation of Akt. Lastly, the protective effects of FML against high glucose-induced cellular senescence in HRECs were abolished by the co-treatment of the PI3K/Akt signaling inhibitor LY294002, suggesting the involvement of this pathway. Taken together, these data revealed that FML-inhibited high glucose-induced cellular senescence mediated by Akt in HERCs, suggesting a novel molecular mechanism of FML."

Innate immunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related complications. The toll-like receptors (TLRs), central to innate immunity, are essential participants in the progression and pathogenesis of the disease and its complications. In the study, streptozotocin (STZ) was combined with whole-body hypoxia for quicker induction of early-stage diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the wild type (WT) and TLR7-knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice. The effects of TLR7 were also investigated in fructose-treated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. In the retinas of WT/DR mice, abnormal a-wave and b-wave activity, hyperfluorescence, and reduced retinal thickness were observed. DR development was associated with enhanced TLR7 expression, whose deletion dramatically reduced VEGF expression levels. And the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18 and IL-12, was highly reduced by TLR7-deficiency in DR mice. Consistently, WT/DR mice exhibited higher phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 (IKK\u03b1), inhibitor of NF-\u03baB \u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which were found to be down-regulated in KO/DR mice. Similarly, DR-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation was blocked by TLR7-knockout. In\u00a0vitro, fructose incubation-triggered inflammation was reversed by TLR7 knockdown, accompanied with inactivated NF-\u03baB and MAPKs pathways. And reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed in TLR7-knockdown cells with fructose treatment. Together, inhibiting TLR7 suppressed diabetic retinopathy by reducing inflammation and suggested a potential application in clinics."

The aims of this study were to identify miRNAs involved in early DR and to characterize their roles in the pathogenesis of DR. METHODS: miRNA-expression profiling was performed in the retina and retinal endothelial cells (RECs) of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats 3 months after the onset of diabetes and miRNAs differentially expressed in diabetic rats were identified and compared with controls. Subsequently, functional annotation analysis was conducted to identify miRNA signatures of pathologic pathways of DR. In addition, in vitro functional assays were used to dissect interactions of miR-146 and NF-\u03baB activation in a conditionally immortalized retinal capillary endothelial cell line, Tr-iBRB. RESULTS: Approximately 350 and 220 miRNAs were detected in the retinas and RECs, respectively, in both control and diabetic rats. At least 86 and 120 miRNAs were differentially expressed (P < 0.01) in the retinas and RECs of diabetic rats and controls, respectively. Upregulation of NF-\u03baB-, VEGF-, and p53-responsive miRNAs constituted key miRNA signatures, reflecting ongoing pathologic changes of early DR. In addition, it was demonstrated that the negative feedback regulation of miR-146 on NF-\u03baB activation may function in Tr-iBRB endothelial cells, suggesting that miR-146 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of DR through its inhibition on NF-\u03baB activation in RECs. CONCLUSIONS: miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of DR through the modulation of multiple pathogenetic pathways and may be novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of DR."

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic disease associated with diabetes mellitus and is a leading cause of visual impairment among the working population in the US. Clinically, DR has been diagnosed and treated as a vascular complication, but it adversely impacts both neural retina and retinal vasculature. Degeneration of retinal neurons and microvasculature manifests in the diabetic retina and early stages of DR. Retinal photoreceptors undergo apoptosis shortly after the onset of diabetes, which contributes to the retinal dysfunction and microvascular complications leading to vision impairment. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of diabetes and a contributor to cell apoptosis, and retinal photoreceptors are a major source of intraocular inflammation that contributes to vascular abnormalities in diabetes. As the levels of microRNAs (miRs) are changed in the plasma and vitreous of diabetic patients, miRs have been suggested as biomarkers to determine the progression of diabetic ocular diseases, including DR. However, few miRs have been thoroughly investigated as contributors to the pathogenesis of DR. Among these miRs, miR-150 is downregulated in diabetic patients and is an endogenous suppressor of inflammation, apoptosis, and pathological angiogenesis. In this review, how miR-150 and its downstream targets contribute to diabetes-associated retinal degeneration and pathological angiogenesis in DR are discussed. Currently, there is no effective treatment to stop or reverse diabetes-caused neural and vascular degeneration in the retina. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of DR may shed light for the future development of more effective treatments for DR and other diabetes-associated ocular diseases."

Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of senescent \u03b2 cells under metabolic stress conditions leads to the progression of T2DM, while senolysis can improve the prognosis. However, the specific mechanism of \u03b2 cell senescence is still unclear. In this study, we found that the increased load of senescence pancreatic \u03b2 cells in both older mice and obese mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) (DIO mice) was accompanied by activation of the Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) - stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and using cGAS or STING small interfering RNA or STING inhibitor C176 to downregulate this pathway reduced the senescence-associated secretion profile (SASP) and senescence of Min6 cells treated with palmitic acid or hydrogen peroxide. C176 intervention in DIO mice also significantly reduced the inflammation and senescence of the islets, thereby protecting the function of pancreatic \u03b2 cell and glucose metabolism. Our study further revealed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage under metabolic stress conditions was critical for the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which can be reversed by the mtDNA depleting agent ethidium bromide. Consistently, mtDNA leakage was more severe in older mice and was accelerated by a chronic HFD. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway to mediate SASP during the accelerated senescence of pancreatic \u03b2-cells induced by metabolic stress, and this process can be downregulated by the STING inhibitor C176."

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-mediated retinal microvascular disease that is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population worldwide. Interleukin (IL)-17A is an inflammatory cytokine that has been previously shown to play a pivotal role in the promotion and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammaT (ROR\u03b3t) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates IL-17A production. However, the role of ROR\u03b3t in diabetes-mediated retinal inflammation and capillary degeneration, as well as its potential therapeutic attributes for diabetic retinopathy has not yet been determined. In the current study, we examined retinal inflammation and vascular pathology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. We found ROR\u03b3t expressing cells in the retinal vasculature of diabetic mice. Further, diabetes-mediated retinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and retinal endothelial cell death were all significantly lower in ROR\u03b3t-/- mice. Finally, when a ROR\u03b3t small molecule inhibitor (SR1001) was subcutaneously injected into diabetic mice, retinal inflammation and capillary degeneration were ameliorated. These findings establish a pathologic role for ROR\u03b3t in the onset of diabetic retinopathy and identify a potentially novel therapeutic for this blinding disease."

                "abstract": "AIM: Aging-related dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the main pathogenic factors for pathological angiogenesis due to dysregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in retinal vascular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the molecular mechanism behind the up-regulation of VEGF in senescent RPE is still blurred. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As oxidative damage is the key cause of RPE dysfunction, we employed a model of oxidative stress-induced premature senescence of ARPE-19 to explore the effect of senescent RPE on VEGF. KEY FINDINGS: We reported that senescent ARPE-19 up-regulated VEGF expression under both short-term and prolonged H2O2 treatment, accompanying with increased HIF-1\u03b1, the key mediator of VEGF. STING signaling, which could be activated by oxidative stress-damaged DNA, was also observed to be increased in senescent ARPE-19 treated with H2O2. And the inhibition of STING significantly reduced HIF-1\u03b1 expression to alleviate the up-regulation of VEGF. NF-\u03baB was also shown to be involved in the regulation of VEGF in senescent ARPE-19 in response to STING signaling. Furthermore, oxidative stress impaired the lysosomal clearance of damaged DNA to enhance STING signaling, thereby up-regulating VEGF expression in senescent RPE. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide evidence that STING plays an important role in VEGF regulation in senescent RPE induced by oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "Selective pericyte loss, the histological hallmark of early diabetic retinopathy (DR), enhances the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in diabetes. However, the role of pericytes on BRB alteration in diabetes and the signaling pathways involved in their effects are currently unknown. To understand the role of diabetes-induced molecular alteration of pericytes, we performed transcriptomic analysis of sorted retinal pericytes from mice model of diabetes. Retinal tissue from non-diabetic and diabetic (duration 3 months) mouse eyes (n\u00a0=\u00a010 in each group) were used to isolate pericytes through fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) using pericyte specific fluorescent antibodies, PDGFRb-APC. For RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis, a cDNA library was generated using template switching oligo and the resulting libraries were sequenced using paired-end Illumina sequencing. Molecular functional pathways were analyzed using differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Differential expression analysis revealed 217 genes significantly upregulated and 495 genes downregulated, in pericytes isolated from diabetic animals. These analyses revealed a core set of differentially expressed genes that could potentially contribute to the pericyte dysfunction in diabetes and highlighted the pattern of functional connectivity between key candidate genes and blood retinal barrier alteration mechanisms. The top up-regulated gene list included: Ext2, B3gat3, Gpc6, Pip5k1c and Pten and down-regulated genes included: Notch3, Xbp1, Gpc4, Atp1a2 and AKT3. Out of these genes, we further validated one of the down regulated genes, Notch 3 and its role in BRB alteration in diabetic retinopathy. We confirmed the downregulation of Notch3 expression in human retinal pericytes exposed to Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) treatment mimicking the chronic hyperglycemia effect. Exploration of pericyte-conditioned media demonstrated that loss of NOTCH3 in pericyte led to increased permeability of endothelial cell monolayers. Collectively, we identify a role for NOTCH3 in pericyte dysfunction in diabetes. Further validation of other DEGs to identify cell specific molecular change through whole transcriptomic approach in diabetic retina will provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of DR and novel therapeutic targets."

                "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rg_1, one of the main active components of precious traditional Chinese medicine Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, has the anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation, anti-aging, neuroprotection, and other pharmacological effects. Diabetic retinopathy(DR), the most common complication of diabetes, is also the main cause of impaired vision and blindness in the middle-aged and the elderly. The latest research shows that ginsenoside Rg_1 can protect patients against DR, but the protection and the mechanism are rarely studied. This study mainly explored the protective effect of ginsenoside Rg_1 against DR in type 2 diabetic mice and the mechanism. High fat diet(HFD) and streptozotocin(STZ) were used to induce type 2 diabetes in mice, and hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining was employed to observe pathological changes in the retina of mice. The immunohistochemistry was applied to study the localization and expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors 3(NLRP3) and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) in retina, and Western blot was used to detect the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B(NF-\u03baB), p-NF-\u03baB, NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin-1\u03b2(IL-1\u03b2), transient receptor potential channel protein 6(TRPC6), nuclear factor of activated T-cell 2(NFAT2), and VEGF in retina. The results showed that ginsenoside Rg_1 significantly alleviated the pathological injury of retina in type 2 diabetic mice. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg_1 significantly decreased the expression of NLRP3 and VEGF in retinal ganglion cells, middle plexiform layer, and outer plexiform layer in type 2 diabetic mice. According to the Western blot results, ginsenoside Rg_1 significantly lowered the expression of p-NF-\u03baB, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, TRPC6, NFAT2, and VEGF in retina of type 2 diabetic mice. These findings suggest that ginsenoside Rg_1 can significantly alleviate DR in type 2 diabetic mice, which may be related to inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and VEGF. This study provides experimental evidence for the clinical application of ginsenoside Rg_1 in the treatment of DR."

                "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Impaired neuronal bioenergetics and neuroinflammation are thought to play key roles in the progression of AD, but their interplay is not clear. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an important metabolite in all human cells in which it is pivotal for multiple processes including DNA repair and mitophagy, both of which are impaired in AD neurons. Here, we report that levels of NAD+ are reduced and markers of inflammation increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mutant transgenic mice with beta-amyloid pathology. Treatment of APP/PS1 mutant mice with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) for 5 mo increased brain NAD+ levels, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased activation of microglia and astrocytes. NR treatment also reduced NLRP3 inflammasome expression, DNA damage, apoptosis, and cellular senescence in the AD mouse brains. Activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are associated with DNA damage and senescence. cGAS-STING elevation was observed in the AD mice and normalized by NR treatment. Cell culture experiments using microglia suggested that the beneficial effects of NR are, in part, through a cGAS-STING-dependent pathway. Levels of ectopic (cytoplasmic) DNA were increased in APP/PS1 mutant mice and human AD fibroblasts and down-regulated by NR. NR treatment induced mitophagy and improved cognitive and synaptic functions in APP/PS1 mutant mice. Our findings suggest a role for NAD+ depletion-mediated activation of cGAS-STING in neuroinflammation and cellular senescence in AD."

There is emerging evidence of the importance of this signaling cascade in a variety of inflammatory diseases settings. Here, we present evidence that the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage-mediated cGAS-STING pathway plays an important role in the induction of inflammation in environmental dry eye (DE). Methods: RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to assess the induction of the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammatory cytokines in environmental DE mouse model, primary human corneal epithelial cells (pHCECs), and patients with DE. RNA sequencing was used to determine mRNA expression patterns of high osmotic pressure (HOP)-stimulated pHCECs. mtDNA was detected with electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescent staining. mtDNA was isolated and transfected into pHCECs for evaluating the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Results: The expression levels of cGAS, STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IFN\u03b2 were significantly increased in an environmental DE model and HOP-stimulated pHCECs. The STING inhibitor decreased the expression of inflammatory factors in DE. An upregulation of STING-mediated immune responses and IRF3 expression mediated by TBK1 were observed in the HOP group. HOP stimulation induced mitochondrial oxidative damage and the leakage of mtDNA into the cytoplasm. Then, mtDNA activated the cGAS-STING pathway and induced intracytoplasmic STING translocated to the Golgi apparatus. Finally, we also found activated cGAS-STING signaling in the human conjunctival blot cell of patients with DE. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the cGAS-STING pathway is activated by recognizing cytoplasmic mtDNA leading to STING translocation, further exacerbating the development of inflammation in environmental DE."

                "abstract": "Hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial dysfunction is a key factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. STING, which is a newly discovered regulator of innate immunity, has also been reported to play an important role in various metabolic diseases. However, the role of STING in diabetes-induced endothelial cell dysfunction is unknown. In this study, we established a diabetic macroangiopathy mouse model by streptozotocin (STZ) injection combined with high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and a glucotoxicity cell model in high glucose (HG)-treated rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). We found that STING expression was specifically increased in the endothelial cells of diabetic arteries, as well as in HG-treated RAECs. Moreover, genetic deletion of STING significantly ameliorated diabetes-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and apoptosis in vivo. Likewise, STING inhibition by C-176 reversed HG-induced migration dysfunction and apoptosis in RAECs, whereas STING activation by DMXAA resulted in migration dysfunction and apoptosis. Mechanistically, hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress promoted endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA release, which subsequently activated the cGAS-STING system and the cGAS-STING-dependent IRF3/NF-kB pathway, ultimately resulting in inflammation and apoptosis. In conclusion, our study identified a novel role of STING in diabetes-induced aortic endothelial cell injury and suggested that STING inhibition was a potential new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetic macroangiopathy.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), currently considered as a neurovascular disease, has become the major cause of blindness. More and more scholars believe that DR is no longer just a kind of microvascular disease, but accompanied by retinal neurodegenerative changes. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs is a classic treatment for DR; however, anti-VEGF drugs can exacerbate fibrosis and eventually lead to retinal detachment. The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of DR and identified new treatments that can provide dual-target intervention for angiogenesis and fibrosis. METHODS: We explored changes in gene expression in high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. We identified bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and SMAD family member 9 (SMAD9) among 449 differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data and confirmed the expression of these two genes in the blood of diabetes patients by RT-PCR and in streptozotocin-induced rat retinas by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot. Moreover, considering that DR is a multifactorial and multicellular disease, we used hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), CoCl2, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and hypoxia to induce three human retinal cell types (M\u00fcller, retinal pigment epithelium, and human retinal capillary endothelial cells) to simulate the pathogenesis of DR, and MTT experiment, scratch experiment, Transwell experiment, and lumen formation experiment were used to test whether the model was successfully established. Then, we verified the overexpression of these two genes in the cell models by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot. We further tested the effects of BMP4 on retinal cells. We use BMP4 to stimulate retinal cells and observe the effect of BMP4 on retinal cells by MTT experiment, scratch experiment, and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that BMP4 and SMAD9 were highly expressed in both in vivo and in vitro models, while BMP4 could significantly upregulate the expression of SMAD9 and promote the expression of VEGF and fibrosis factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to analyze the mechanism by which high glucose levels affect retinal vascular endothelial cells through RNA transcriptome sequencing and indicates that BMP4 may be a potential target for the dual-target treatment (anti-VEGF and anti-fibrosis) of DR. KEY MESSAGES: \u2022 High-glucose effect on vascular endothelial cell was analyzed by RNA-seq. \u2022 KEGG analysis revealed enrichment of TGF-beta signaling pathway. \u2022 SMAD9 and BMP4 expression was upregulated in all samples. \u2022 Dual-target therapy of PDR by antagonizing BMP4."

            "abstract": "Purpose: N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is an alkylating toxicant with potent mutagenic ability. This study was designed to induce apoptosis in lens epithelial cells (LECs) and corneal endothelial cells (CECs) via MNU administration. We sought to build ocular disease models of cataract and corneal endothelial decompensation. Methods: MNU was delivered into the intraperitoneal cavities of neonatal rats and the anterior chambers of adult rabbits. The MNU-treated animals were then subjected to a series of functional and morphological analyses at various time points. Results: MNU treatment induced pervasive apoptosis of LECs and CECs. These effects were dose and time dependent. Mature cataracts were found in neonatal rats 3 weeks after MNU treatment. Histological analysis revealed that MNU toxicity induced swelling, vacuolation, and liquefaction in lens fibers of MNU-treated rats. Pentacam examination showed that the average density of rat lens increased significantly after MNU administration. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis showed pervasive apoptotic staining in the lenses of MNU-treated rats. In rabbit eyes, intracameral treatment with MNU induced corneal edema and significantly increased central corneal thickness, which peaked at P14. Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that CECs were effectively ablated in the MNU-treated rabbits. The expression of 8-OHdG increased significantly in the cornea of MNU-treated rabbits, compared with vehicle-treated controls. Conclusions: MNU is sufficient to induce ocular cell apoptosis in animal models. These models of MNU-induced cataract and corneal endothelial decompensation represent valuable tools for efforts to develop relevant therapies."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2) on MNU-induced corneal endothelial cell (CEC) injury and the underlying mechanism. Methods: MNU-induced animal models of CEC injury were washed with hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) for 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemical staining, and corneal endothelial assessment were applied to determine architectural and cellular changes on the corneal endothelium following HRS treatment. MNU-induced cell models of CEC injury were co-cultured with H2. The effect of H2 was examined using morphological and functional assays. Results: It was shown that MNU could inhibit the proliferation and specific physiological functions of CECs by increasing apoptosis and decreasing the expression of ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas H2 improved the proliferation and physiological function of CECs by anti-apoptosis. Cell experiments further confirmed that H2 could reverse MNU damage to CECs by decreasing oxidative stress injury, interfering with the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway and the FOXO3a/p53/p21 pathway. Conclusions: This study suggests that topical application of H2 could protect CECs against corneal damage factors through anti-apoptotic effect, reduce the incidence and severity of corneal endothelial decompensation, and maintain corneal transparency."

A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), an alkylating agent, causes photoreceptor cell apoptosis within seven days in rats. Curcumin is a polyphenolic natural product with pluripotent properties including antioxidant activity. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin against photoreceptor apoptosis in a MNU-induced retinal degeneration rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single i.p. injection of 40 mg/kg MNU. Three days prior to MNU injection, daily i.p. injections of 100 or 200 mg/kg curcumin were started, and the injections were continued once daily until sacrifice. Rats were sacrificed at 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, and 7 days after MNU, and their eyes were examined morphologically and morphometrically to evaluate the photoreceptor cell ratio and retinal damage ratio in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Retinal 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the apoptotic cell ratio in photoreceptor cells was determined in situ by TdT-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: Curcumin (200 mg/kg) significantly (p<0.01) suppressed the loss of photoreceptor cells, as determined by the photoreceptor cell ratio at the central retina seven days after MNU, and this effect was dose-dependent. At 12 h after MNU injection, when the oxidative DNA damage caused by MNU peaked, curcumin significantly reduced the level of 8-OHdG (0.78 vs. 0.50 ng/ml) (p<0.05) and the percentage of TUNEL-positive photoreceptor cells (17.5% vs. 10.8%) (p<0.05) as compared with MNU-exposed, curcumin-untreated retina, respectively. CONCLUSION: Curcumin inhibited MNU-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis by suppressing DNA oxidative stress. These findings indicate that curcumin may help to suppress the onset and progression of human retinitis pigmentosa."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as the crucial contributor to the retinal photoreceptor apoptosis seen in MNU-treated rats. In the present study, we explored the therapeutic effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS), a selective ROS scavenger, on MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of HRS ameliorated MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration in terms of morphology and function: Sharply decreased thickness of the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) and flattened photopic and scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) waveforms, typically seen in response to MNU treatment, were substantially rescued in rats cotreated with MNU and HRS (MNU\u00a0+\u00a0HRS). Moreover, the terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed a smaller number of apoptotic photoreceptors in the MNU\u00a0+\u00a0HRS group compared that in the MNU group. Compared to MNU-treated rats, retinal malondialdehyde (MDA) content in MNU\u00a0+\u00a0HRS rats significantly decreased while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased. Morphological and multi-electrode array (MEA) analyses revealed more efficient preservation of the architecture and field potential waveforms in particularly the peripheral regions of the retinas within the MNU\u00a0+\u00a0HRS group, compared to that in the MNU group. However, this enhanced protection of structure and function in the peripheral retina is unlikely the result of site-dependent variation in the efficacy of HRS; rather, it is most likely due to reduced susceptibility of peripheral photoreceptors to MNU-induced degeneration. Inner retinal neuron function in the MNU\u00a0+\u00a0HRS rats was better preserved, with fewer apoptotic photoreceptors in the ONL. Collectively, these results support the rationale for future clinical evaluation of HRS as a therapeutic agent for human RP."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ocular injuries following exposure to the toxic agent sulfur mustard (SM) are characterized by acute corneal erosions and inflammation of the anterior segment that may be followed by delayed corneal injuries, expressed clinically by neovascularization and epithelial defects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of SM on corneal endothelium (CE) during the acute and delayed phase in relation to the development of the long-term pathology. METHODS: Rabbit eyes were exposed to SM vapor. A clinical follow-up including pachymetry for measurement of corneal thickness were conducted up to 3 months following exposure. In vivo analysis of corneal endothelium in the central and peripheral cornea was carried out, using a contact specular microscopy. Morphometric analysis of cell area and number of cells was performed, to include the acute and delayed phases. Eyes were taken for histology at different time points following exposure (1 h to 3 months). TUNEL staining (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) was conducted for detection of apoptosis during the acute phase. RESULTS: SM induced acute corneal erosions and prolonged anterior segment inflammation. Corneal thickness increased within hours, declined after few days but remained higher compared to baseline value for months after the exposure, indicating a chronic edema. Apoptotic alterations were first observed at 6 h resulting in a significant decline in the number of endothelial cells at 24-48 h following exposure. Healing of the endothelium was relatively fast and at one week the Descemet's membrane was resurfaced, yet, the density and morphology of the cells was often abnormal. Moreover, histological evaluation revealed deformation and enlargement of many cells (polymegathism and pleomorphism), thickening and double layered Descemet's membrane. These changes were more pronounced in corneas displaying delayed pathology. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: SM induced apoptotic cell death of endothelial cells that was accompanied by corneal edema. The impaired healing of the endothelium, including the decrease in endothelial cell density was associated with the delayed-onset injuries. Since human corneal endothelium is almost amitotic, endothelium toxicity should be taken into consideration when testing potential treatments against ocular injuries following SM exposure."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of adenoassociated virus delivery of XIAP in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced retinal degeneration in Sprague-Dawley rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were injected subretinally with recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) encoding either XIAP or green fluorescent protein (GFP; injection control). Six weeks after injection, the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of MNU, a DNA methylating agent, at a dose of 60 mg/kg. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours and 1 week after MNU. The rats were killed after the ERG was performed and were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Eyes were then enucleated and embedded for cryosectioning. Eye sections were analyzed by TUNEL and histologic techniques. Real-time PCR and Western analysis were performed to confirm the overexpression of XIAP in injected eyes. RESULTS: Real-time PCR and Western analysis confirmed the overexpression of XIAP in virus-injected eyes in comparison to uninjected control eyes. At 24 hours after MNU injection, fewer cells had undergone apoptosis in the XIAP-treated eyes in comparison with GFP-injected or uninjected eyes. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that the uninjected and GFP-injected photoreceptors were destroyed by 72 hours after injection of MNU, whereas the AAV-XIAP-injected eyes showed structural protection of the photoreceptors at all time points throughout the 1-week sampling period. ERGs showed functional protection up to 1 week after MNU injection in the AAV-XIAP-injected eye, whereas no response was observed in the control eye. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that XIAP is protective against this potent chemotoxic agent and holds promise as a therapeutic agent in gene therapy approaches to treating retinitis pigmentosa."

METHODS: Eight pigmented Chinchilla Bastard rabbits were injected intravitreally with MNU (1\u00a0\u00d7 1mg/kg body weight (BW), 1\u00a0\u00d7 2mg/kg BW, 3\u00a0\u00d7 3mg/kg BW, 1\u00a0\u00d7 4mg/kg BW, 1\u00a0\u00d7 6mg/kg BW, and 1\u00a0\u00d7 DMSO\u2009+\u2009PBS as control). One, 2, and 3\u00a0weeks after injection, the effects on the rabbit retina were examined in vivo using clinical observation (macroscopic images, funduscopy, weighing of the animals), measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), full-field Electroretinography (ffERG), and spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (sd-OCT). After\u00a03\u00a0weeks follow-up, blood samples were taken to evaluate the general health status of the animals, and immunohistochemistry (IH) was performed on sections obtained from six different regions throughout the whole retina to evaluate MNU effects in more detail. RESULTS: It was difficult to observe the effects of MNU on retinal structure by OCT in vivo. Only the temporal quadrant of the retina could be visualized. Therefore, it was indispensible to evaluate the effects of MNU on the retina in vitro by examining six areas of the retina using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry plays a decisive role to evaluate the effects on retinal cells other than photoreceptors while in H&E staining, namely the cell count of the ONL can be observed. The results obtained in vivo and in vitro in this study mainly follow the results of a previous study in mice. The low doses of MNU (1, 2 mg/kg BW) had no effects on retinal function and morphology, while high doses (4, 6 mg/kg BW) led to retinal changes in combination with significant side-effects (e.g., cataractous changes). Injection of 3 mg/kg BW MNU induced selective photoreceptor degeneration. However, the degree of degeneration varied between different parts of the same retina and between retinae of different animals. In two of three animals, a complete loss of ERG potentials was observed. Negative effects on the contralateral eye or on general welfare of the animal were never observed. CONCLUSIONS: In rabbits, the intravitreal injection of 3 mg/kg BW MNU leads to selective but inhomogeneous photoreceptor degeneration."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg/kg MNU was administered to 15-day-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. In Experiment 1, rats were then subcutaneously injected with 1000 mg/kg nicotinamide either once or 3 times at 1-week intervals. In Experiment 2, rats were subcutaneously injected once with 50 mg/kg 3-aminobenzamide. For comparison, the following age-matched controls were included: MNU-untreated nicotinamide-injected rats, MNU-untreated 3-aminobenzamide-injected rats, and MNU-untreated PARP-inhibitor-untreated rats. Rats were examined for lens opacity. At 28 days after MNU injection, 10 to 20 rats per group were sacrificed In Experiment 1, at 3 days after MNU injection, 10 rats per group were sacrificed for apoptosis and cell proliferation detection. RESULTS: MNU caused lens epithelial cell apoptosis in the germinative zone, as indicated by TUNEL staining. However, regardless of MNU treatment lens epithelial cell proliferation was consistently seen in the germinative zone and sporadically seen in the central zone. At 28 days after MNU, mature cataracts were observed Nicotinamide significantly accelerated lens opacity and cataractogenesis, as indicated by a cataract index 3-Aminobenzamide significantly accelerated the development of lens opacity and tended to accelerate cataractogenesis.

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: To study Bcl-2 expression and apoptotic cell shedding of the rabbit corneal epithelium during extended wear of low and hyper Dk rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses. METHODS: Rabbits were fit with either a low or a hyper Dk RGP lens (Dk/Ltotal= 10 and 97). The rabbits wore the lenses for either 24 hours, 3 days, or 1 week at which point they were humanely sacrificed. Immunocytochemistry and western blot analyses were performed to detect Bcl-2 in the corneal epithelium; TUNEL assay (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) was used to identify apoptotic epithelial cells. RESULTS: 1) Immunocytochemistry: In the normal cornea, antibodies to Bcl-2 uniformly stained nuclei of all epithelial cell layers. Occasional surface epithelial cells, however, showed no anti-Bcl-2 nuclear staining; concomitant TUNEL assay revealed that all TUNEL-labeled-surface cells were Bcl-2 negative. By contrast, RGP contact lens wear, regardless of test lens oxygen transmissibility or lens wearing interval, significantly decreased both the total number of Bcl-2 negative and TUNEL-labeled cells on the epithelial surface (P < 0.05). In addition, contact lens wear was associated with labeling of keratocytes with TUNEL assay in the anterior stroma. 2) Western blot analysis: Total epithelial layer Bcl-2 expression was markedly decreased in the low Dk lens test group but was similar to control values in the hyper Dk lens test group. CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 protein seems to play an important role in the regulation of apoptotic cell shedding in the normal rabbit corneal epithelium. The identical staining pattern was seen in previous studies of the normal human cornea. RGP contact lens wear, however, appears to block the changes in Bcl-2 protein prior to apoptotic surface cell shedding, suggesting a lens-related anti-apoptotic effect. Taken together, these findings may explain why contact lens wear reduces surface cell exfoliation as previously reported in human studies."

                "abstract": "In the present study, we examined the potent retinoprotective effects of an ethanol-based extract of Aucuba japonica (AJE) and its active ingredient, aucubin, on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced retinal degeneration in mice. Retinal degeneration was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of MNU (60 mg/kg). AJE (250 mg/kg) and aucubin (15 mg/kg) were orally administered for 1 week after the MNU injection. Electroretinography (ERG) and histological examinations were performed. Retinal apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage were also quantified. The retinoprotective abilities of AJE and aucubin were also assessed in primary cultured retinal cells. Morphologically, MNU induced a remarkable decrease in the outer nuclear layer, which contains photoreceptor cells. However, this layer was well preserved in the AJE- and aucubin-administered mice. The ERG responses significantly decreased in both a- and b-wave amplitudes in the MNU-injected mice. In the AJE and aucubin-treated mice, ERG responses were significantly increased. In addition, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemical staining for 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) revealed that both AJE and aucubin attenuated MNU-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, the in vitro assay also showed that AJE and aucubin have potent anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities in primary cultured retinal cells. These results indicate that AJE and aucubin have potent retinoprotective effects, and that this retinoprotective activity is as a result of the potency of the bioactive compound, aucubin. These pharmacological characteristics suggest the additional application of AJE or aucubin in the treatment of patients with retinal degenerative diseases."

The effects of dietary arachidonic acid (AA) supplementation on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced retinal degeneration was investigated in young Lewis rats during the gestational, lactational and post-weaning periods. Dams were fed 0\u00b71, 0\u00b75 or 2\u00b70% AA diets or a basal (< 0\u00b701% AA) diet. On postnatal day 21 (at weaning), male pups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg MNU/kg or vehicle, and were fed the same diet as their mother for 7 d. Retinal apoptosis was analysed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP digoxigenin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay 24 h after the MNU treatment, and retinal morphology was examined 7 d post-MNU. Histologically, all rats that received MNU and were fed the basal and 0\u00b71% AA diets developed retinal degeneration characterised by the loss of photoreceptor cells (disappearance of the outer nuclear layer and the photoreceptor layer) in the central retina. The 0\u00b75 and 2\u00b70% AA diets rescued rats from retinal damage. Morphometrically, in parallel with the AA dose (0\u00b75 and 2\u00b70% AA), the photoreceptor ratio significantly increased and the retinal damage ratio decreased in the central retina, compared with the corresponding ratios in basal diet-fed rats. In parallel with the increase in serum and retinal AA levels and the AA:DHA ratio, the apoptotic index in the central retina was dose-dependently decreased in rats fed the 0\u00b75 and 2\u00b70% AA diets. In conclusion, an AA-rich diet during the gestation, lactation and post-weaning periods rescued young Lewis rats from MNU-induced retinal degeneration via the inhibition of photoreceptor apoptosis. Therefore, an AA-enriched diet in the prenatal and postnatal periods may be an important strategy to suppress the degree of photoreceptor injury in humans."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lycium barbarum L., popularly known as \"Goji berry\", a classic of Traditional Chinese Medicine has long been used to treat ocular diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the photoreceptor cell protection of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP), a water extract from Lycium barbarum L. has received more attention. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of LBP on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis, and the involvement of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Photoreceptor cell injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by an intraperitoneal injection of MNU 60mg/kg. Seven days prior to MNU injection, LBP were intragastrical administered daily, rats were sacrificed at 24h and 7 days after MNU injection. Retinal morphologies, photoreceptor cells apoptosis, and protein expression were evaluated at 24h and 7 days after MNU injection. RESULTS: Morphologically, the outer nuclear layer was well preserved in the LBP-treated rat retinas throughout the experimental period. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays showed that LBP could significantly suppress the loss of photoreceptor cells, as determined by the photoreceptor cell ratio at the central retina 24h and 7 days after MNU administration. Western-blot analysis demonstrated the expression levels of procaspase-9, -7, -3 and cleaved caspase-9, -7, -3 were upregulated, and PARP were downregulated both 24h and 7 days after MNU injection. LBP treatment significantly decreased protein levels of procaspase and cleaved caspase, increased the level of PARP and cleaved PARP on 24h and 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: LBP inhibits MNU-induced rat photoreceptor cell apoptosis and protects retinal structure via the regulation of the expressions of PARP and caspase."

METHODS: N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-administered mice received TES or sham stimulations and were subsequently subjected to electroretinography (ERG), multielectrode array (MEA), and histologic and immunohistochemistry examinations. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were also performed to determine the mRNA levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Calpain-2, Caspase-3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). RESULTS: Amplitudes of ERG b-wave in the TES-treated mice were significantly larger than those in the sham controls (P < 0.01). Microelectrode array examination revealed that the photoreceptors in TES-treated retina were efficiently preserved (P < 0.01). Morphologic measurements showed that the central retina region was more consolidated than the other areas in the TES-treated mice. Together with the disproportionate distribution of immunostaining in retinal flat mounts, these findings indicated that different rescuing kinetics existed among regional photoreceptors. Compared with the sham controls, a significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio was also found in the TES-treated mice (TES100: 2.02 \u00b1 1.12; TES200: 4.42 \u00b1 1.51; sham: 0.25 \u00b1 0.13; P < 0.01). Moreover, qRT-PCR measurements suggested that the altered expression of several apoptotic factors and neurotrophic cytokines was correlated with TES-induced protection. CONCLUSIONS: Regional photoreceptors in the MNU-administered retinas exhibit different sensitivities to TES. Transcorneal electrical stimulation is capable of ameliorating MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration and rectifying abnormalities in the inner visual signal pathways."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of an autologous serum treatment of post-LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) corneal epithelial defects in a rabbit model. METHODS: Five milliliters blood samples from 10 New Zealand rabbits were obtained by venepuncture. The serum was aseptically separated and diluted with saline solution to 20%. The final preparation was placed into 3-mL bottles with ultraviolet protection and maintained at 4 degrees C. Corneas were de-epithelialized using a 7-mm optical zone marker. A 160-microm thick flap was created in both eyes of all rabbits using an automatic corneal shaper microkeratome. Right eyes were treated with serum drops 6 times per day. Left eyes were treated with preservative-free artificial tears. Vital staining of the ocular surface and the area of corneal epithelial defect was measured daily for 1 week. Rabbits were humanely euthanized at postoperative day 7, and corneas were fixed and sectioned. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. RESULTS: Corneas treated with autologous serum had a statistically significant increase in the epithelial healing rate compared with those treated with artificial tears. Serum-treated corneas showed significantly less terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in the interface, minimal inflammatory cell infiltration, and less induced synthesis of stromal chondroitin sulfate than did corneas treated with preservative-free artificial tears. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with autologous serum could be an efficient way to provide essential components to the ocular surface in the treatment of post-LASIK epithelial defects. Autologous serum induces faster epithelial healing than do artificial tears, leading to (1) a decrease in keratocyte apoptosis and migration of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the wound site, (2) a decrease in the migration of inflammatory cells, and (3) a consequent inhibition of cytokine release. This treatment could improve long-term refractive results post-LASIK."

This study aimed to investigate the role of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in MNU-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Adult rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of MNU (60\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight). Hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated progressive outer nuclear layer (ONL) loss after MNU treatment. Transmission electron microscopy revealed nuclear pyknosis, chromatin margination in the photoreceptors, increased secondary lysosomes, and lobulated retinal-pigmented epithelial cells in MNU-treated rats. Numerous photoreceptor cells in the ONL showed positive TUNEL staining and apoptosis rate peaked at 24\u00a0hours. Enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed ONL thinning and decreased choroid thickness. Electroretinograms showed decreased A wave amplitude that predominated in scotopic conditions. Western blot analysis showed that nuclear I\u03baB\u03b1 level increased, whereas nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 decreased significantly in the retinas of MNU-treated rats. These findings indicate that MNU leads to selective photoreceptor degradation, and this is associated with the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation."

Chemoprotective agents have been used to protect against or eradicate prostate malignancies. Here, we investigated the protective effect of \u03b3-tocopherol on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced epithelial dysplasia in the rat ventral prostate (VP). Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 8): control (CT): healthy control animals fed a standard diet; control+\u03b3-tocopherol (CT+\u03b3T): healthy control animals without intervention fed a \u03b3-tocopherol-enriched diet (20 mg/kg); N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU): rats that received a single dose of MNU (30 mg/kg) plus testosterone propionate (100 mg/kg) and were fed a standard diet; and MNU+\u03b3-tocopherol (MNU+\u03b3T): rats that received the same treatment of MNU plus testosterone and were fed with a \u03b3-tocopherol-enriched diet (20 mg/kg). After 4 months, the VPs were excised to evaluate morphology, cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), glutathione-S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) and androgen receptor (AR) protein expression, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity. An increase in the incidence of epithelial dysplasias, such as stratified epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, in the MNU group was accompanied by augmented cell proliferation, GST-pi and Cox-2 immunoexpression and pro-MMP-9 activity. Stromal thickening and inflammatory foci were also observed. The administration of a \u03b3-tocopherol-enriched diet significantly attenuated the adverse effects of MNU in the VP. The incidence of epithelial dysplasia decreased, along with the cell proliferation index, GST-pi and Cox-2 immunoexpression. The gelatinolytic activity of pro-MMP-9 returned to the levels observed for the CT group. These results suggest that \u03b3-tocopherol acts as a protective agent against MNU-induced prostatic disorders in the rat ventral prostate."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have showed that photooxidative stress can lead to down-modulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity causing apoptosis of cultured photoreceptor cells. This study aimed at investigating whether NF-kappaB was involved in photoreceptor cells apoptosis induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in rats. METHODS: A single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg MNU was given to 50-day-old female rats. At different intervals after MNU treatment, the animals were sacrificed. Retinal damage was examined by a light microscope. The apoptotic index of the photoreceptor cells was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL). NF-kappaB was analysed by Western blot and Transcriptin Factor Assay Kits. RESULTS: The pyknosis of the photoreceptor nuclei and the disorientation of the outer segment of the photoreceptor layer was seen after MNU treatment for 24 hours. The outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer were almost completely lost at 7 days. Photoreceptor cells apoptosis reached the peaked value at 24 hours. In apoptotic cascade, the protein levels of NF-kappaB p65 were only detected after MNU treatment for 12 and 24 hours in the nucleus. Conversely, the amounts of IkappaBalpha were markedly increased in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. The activity of NF-kappaB p65 in the nucleus was down-modulated in the end. CONCLUSIONS: MNU-induced photoreceptor cell destruction was attributed to the apoptotic process by down-regulating the activation of NF-kappaB p65."

            "abstract": "Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) represents a major risk factor for glaucoma, a prevalent eye disease characterized by death of retinal ganglion cells; lowering IOP is the only proven treatment strategy to delay disease progression. The main determinant of IOP is the equilibrium between production and drainage of aqueous humor, with compromised drainage generally viewed as the primary contributor to dangerous IOP elevations. Drainage occurs through two pathways in the anterior segment of the eye called conventional and uveoscleral. To gain insights into the cell types that comprise these pathways, we used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). From \u223c24,000 single-cell transcriptomes, we identified 19 cell types with molecular markers for each and used histological methods to localize each type. We then performed similar analyses on four organisms used for experimental studies of IOP dynamics and glaucoma: cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), pig (Sus scrofa), and mouse (Mus musculus). Many human cell types had counterparts in these models, but differences in cell types and gene expression were evident. Finally, we identified the cell types that express genes implicated in glaucoma in all five species. Together, our results provide foundations for investigating the pathogenesis of glaucoma and for using model systems to assess mechanisms and potential interventions."

                "abstract": "The conventional outflow pathway is a complex tissue responsible for maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP) homeostasis. The coordinated effort of multiple cells with differing responsibilities ensures healthy outflow function and IOP maintenance. Dysfunction of one or more resident cell types results in ocular hypertension and risk for glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human conventional outflow tissues. We obtained expression profiles of 17,757 genes from 8,758 cells from eight eyes of human donors representing the outflow cell transcriptome. Upon clustering analysis, 12 distinct cell types were identified, and region-specific expression of candidate genes was mapped in human tissues. Significantly, we identified two distinct expression patterns (myofibroblast- and fibroblast-like) from cells located in the trabecular meshwork (TM), the primary structural component of the conventional outflow pathway. We also located Schwann cell and macrophage signatures in the TM. The second primary component structure, Schlemm's canal, displayed a unique combination of lymphatic/blood vascular gene expression. Other expression clusters corresponded to cells from neighboring tissues, predominantly in the ciliary muscle/scleral spur, which together correspond to the uveoscleral outflow pathway. Importantly, the utility of our atlas was demonstrated by mapping glaucoma-relevant genes to outflow cell clusters. Our study provides a comprehensive molecular and cellular classification of conventional and unconventional outflow pathway structures responsible for IOP homeostasis."

                "abstract": "Glaucoma is a blinding disease. Reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the mainstay of treatment, but current drugs show side effects or become progressively ineffective, highlighting the need for novel compounds. We have synthesized a family of perhydro-1,4-oxazepine derivatives of digoxin, the selective inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase. The cyclobutyl derivative (DcB) displays strong selectivity for the human \u03b12 isoform and potently reduces IOP in rabbits. These observations appeared consistent with a hypothesis that in ciliary epithelium DcB inhibits the \u03b12 isoform of Na,K-ATPase, which is expressed strongly in nonpigmented cells, reducing aqueous humor (AH) inflow. This paper extends assessment of efficacy and mechanism of action of DcB using an ocular hypertensive nonhuman primate model (OHT-NHP) (Macaca fascicularis). In OHT-NHP, DcB potently lowers IOP, in both acute (24 h) and extended (7-10 days) settings, accompanied by increased aqueous humor flow rate (AFR). By contrast, ocular normotensive animals (ONT-NHP) are poorly responsive to DcB, if at all. The mechanism of action of DcB has been analyzed using isolated porcine ciliary epithelium and perfused enucleated eyes to study AH inflow and AH outflow facility, respectively. 1) DcB significantly stimulates AH inflow although prior addition of 8-Br-cAMP, which raises AH inflow, precludes additional effects of DcB. 2) DcB significantly increases AH outflow facility via the trabecular meshwork (TM). Taken together, the data indicate that the original hypothesis on the mechanism of action must be revised. In the OHT-NHP, and presumably other species, DcB lowers IOP by increasing AH outflow facility rather than by decreasing AH inflow.NEW & NOTEWORTHY When applied topically, a cyclobutyl derivative of digoxin (DcB) potently reduces intraocular pressure in an ocular hypertensive nonhuman primate model (Macaca fascicularis), associated with increased aqueous humor (AH) flow rate (AFR). The mechanism of action of DcB involves increased AH outflow facility as detected in enucleated perfused porcine eyes and, in parallel, increased (AH) inflow as detected in isolated porcine ciliary epithelium. DcB might have potential as a drug for the treatment of open-angle human glaucoma."

                "abstract": "Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which causes optic nerve damage and retinal ganglion cell death, is the primary risk factor for blindness in glaucoma patients. IOP is controlled by the balance between aqueous humor secretion from the ciliary body (CB) and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork (TM). How microRNAs (miRs) regulate IOP and glaucoma in vivo is largely unknown. Here we show that miR-143 and miR-145 expression is enriched in the smooth muscle and trabecular meshwork in the eye. Targeted deletion of miR-143/145 in mice results in significantly reduced IOP, consistent with an ~2-fold increase in outflow facilities. However, aqueous humor production in the same mice appears to be normal based on a microbeads-induced glaucoma model. Mechanistically, we found that miR-143/145 regulates actin dynamics and the contractility of TM cells, consistent with its regulation of actin-related protein complex (ARPC) subunit 2, 3, and 5, as well as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in these cells. Our data establish miR-143/145 as important regulators of IOP, which may have important therapeutic implications in glaucoma."

                "abstract": "Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most effective treatment of glaucoma, however most of the current available glaucoma drugs target a single molecule. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that target a network of molecules. This study aims to investigate the role of miR-21-5p in regulating IOP and the mechanism of function. miR-21-5p mimics was topically applied to C57/BL6 mouse eyes, which significantly increased miR-21-5p expression in the conventional outflow tissue and reduced IOP by a maximum of 17.77% at 24\u00a0h after treatment. The conventional outflow facility measured by ex vivo moue eye perfusion of miR-21-5p was significantly increased by 60.14%. Moreover, miR-21-5p overexpression significantly reduced the transendothelial electrical resistance in porcine angular aqueous plexus cells. Transcriptome analysis and further quantification by Western blot and PCR revealed that SMAD7 and FGF18 might be the downstream target of miR-21-5p in regulating aqueous humor outflow. The predicted functional pathways PTEN/eNOS, RhoB/pMLC and TIMP3/MMP9 were significantly altered after miR-21-5p transfection. Dual luciferase assay verified the direct targets of miR-21-5p. In conclusion, miR-21-5p seems to regulate IOP by modulating multiple genes that are associated with aqueous humor outflow, including genes those regulating cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics and extracellular matrix turnover. Thus, miR-21-5p represents a new therapeutic strategy for glaucoma and a viable alternative to existing multidrug regimens."

The increase in IOP is due to impeded aqueous humor (AH) outflow through the conventional pathway. The aberrant increased resistance at the trabecular meshwork (TM), the filter-like region in the anterior eye chamber is the major contributory factor in causing the impeded outflow. In normal as well as in glaucoma eyes the regions of the TM are divided into areas of high and low flow. The collector channels and distal outflow regions are now increasingly being recognized as potential players in contributing to impede AH outflow. Structural and molecular make-up contributing to the segmental blockage to outflow is likely to provide greater insight. Establishing segmental blockage to outflow in model systems of glaucoma such as the mouse in parallel to human eyes will expand our repertoire of tools for investigation. Further study into this area of interest has the potential to ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutics focused on lowering IOP by targeting the various components of segmental blockage of outflow in the TM and in the distal outflow region."

                "abstract": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be a predominant risk factor for primary open angle glaucoma, the most prevalent form of glaucoma. Although the etiological mechanisms responsible for increased IOP are not completely clear, impairment in aqueous humor (AH) drainage through the conventional or trabecular pathway is recognized to be a primary cause in glaucoma patients. Importantly, lowering of IOP has been demonstrated to reduce progression of vision loss and is a mainstay of treatment for all types of glaucoma. Currently however, there are limited therapeutic options available for lowering IOP especially as it relates to enhancement of AH outflow through the trabecular pathway. Towards addressing this challenge, bench and bedside research conducted over the course of the last decade and a half has identified the significance of inhibiting Rho kinase for lowering IOP. Rho kinase is a downstream effector of Rho GTPase signaling that regulates actomyosin dynamics in numerous cell types. Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that inhibition of Rho kinase lowers IOP via relaxation of the trabecular meshwork which enhances AH outflow. By contrast, activation of Rho GTPase/Rho kinase signaling in the trabecular outflow pathway increases IOP by altering the contractile, cell adhesive and permeability barrier characteristics of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal tissues, and by influencing extracellular matrix production and fibrotic activity. This article, written in honor of the late David Epstein, MD, summarizes findings from both basic and clinical studies that have been instrumental for recognition of the importance of the Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathway in regulation of AH outflow, and in the development of Rho kinase inhibitors as promising IOP- lowering agents for glaucoma treatment."

                "abstract": "Glaucoma, a progressive neurodegenerative ocular disease, is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most common-and the only treatable-risk factor for glaucoma. IOP is generated by the balance between production and removal of aqueous humor in the anterior part of the eye, and the latter happens either through the uveoscleral or the conventional pathway. Although both pathways are important for aqueous humor removal, dysfunction within the conventional pathway is more commonly associated with increased resistance leading to elevated IOP and glaucoma. The conventional pathway can be separated into proximal (trabecular meshwork and inner wall of Schlemm's canal) and distal (outer wall of Schlemm's canal, collector channels, and episcleral vasculature) regions. Both regions contribute resistance to aqueous humor removal, but the proximal region has been studied more extensively due to the availability of model systems. In contrast, little is known about the role of the distal region in outflow resistance, largely due to the lack of suitable in vitro models. To address this, we have developed a novel method of isolating and culturing vascular distal outflow pathway (VDOP) cells from the distal outflow region of human eyes. VDOP cells can be used to study the physiological and molecular functions of cells in the distal outflow region and can help in the development of ocular hypotensive drugs that specifically target this area. We also provide a protocol describing immunohistochemical methods to validate the molecular profile of these cells, utilizing cell surface markers that distinguish them from adjacent cells. \u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) based on elevated levels in glaucomatous aqueous humor and its ability to induce extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the trabecular meshwork (TM). The goal of this study was to generate a rodent model of POAG using viral gene transfer of human TGFbeta2. Methods. Latent (hTGFbeta2(WT)) or active (C226S, C228S; hTGFbeta2(226/228)) TGFbeta2-encoding cDNA was cloned into the pac.Ad5.CMV.K-N.pA shuttle vector for generation of replication-deficient adenovirus. Empty adenovirus (Ad5.CMV.K-N.pA) was used as a control. Adenoviral expression of active and total TGFbeta2 was assayed in vitro by the transduction of Chinese hamster ovary and trabecular meshwork cells. BALB/cJ mice or Wistar rats were injected either intracamerally or intravitreally with the adenovectors and assessed for changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) using the rebound tonometer. At peak IOP, aqueous outflow facility and total TGFbeta2 levels in aqueous humor were measured. Mouse eye morphology was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results. Adenoviral gene transfer of hTGFbeta2(226/228), but not hTGFbeta2(WT), to the rodent eye elevated IOP in rat (43%, P < 0.001) and mouse (110%, P < 0.001) and reduced aqueous humor outflow facility in the mouse. The TGFbeta2-induced ocular hypertension correlated with anterior segment TGFbeta2 expression levels (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. The adenoviral TGFbeta2 rodent model displays the glaucoma risk factors of elevated IOP and decreased aqueous outflow facility and may potentially serve as a model for studying glaucoma."

Here, we demonstrate that mice deficient in the Kr\u00fcppel-like zinc finger transcriptional factor GLI-similar-1 (GLIS1) develop chronically elevated IOP. Magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological analysis reveal that deficiency in GLIS1 expression induces progressive degeneration of the TM, leading to inefficient AqH drainage from the anterior chamber and elevated IOP. Transcriptome and cistrome analyses identified several glaucoma- and extracellular matrix-associated genes as direct transcriptional targets of GLIS1. We also identified a significant association between GLIS1 variant rs941125 and glaucoma in humans (P = 4.73 \u00d7 10-6), further supporting a role for GLIS1 into glaucoma etiology.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using a specific mouse antihuman ELAM-1 antibody was performed on the trabecular meshwork system of five pigs. The episcleral veins of the left eyes were cauterized as reported elsewhere to induce glaucoma. Immunodetection of ELAM-1 was assayed in human trabecular meshwork samples obtained from trabeculectomy as a positive control. RESULTS: Pig eyes exhibiting elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) due to experimental glaucoma as reported elsewhere, were found to exhibit ELAM-1 immunoreactivity in their trabecular meshwork. CONCLUSIONS: ELAM-1 protein, the first molecular marker for human glaucoma, can also be considered a candidate molecular marker of induced glaucoma in the pig model of experimental glaucoma. The results of our study further validated the pig eye as an animal model of glaucoma, since increased expression of ELAM-1, which has been found in the trabecular meshwork of human eyes with glaucoma, is also found in pig eyes subjected to experimental glaucoma via episcleral vein cauterization."

                "abstract": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the critical risk factor for glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease and frequent cause of blindness worldwide. As of today, all effective strategies to treat glaucoma aim at lowering IOP. IOP is generated and maintained via the aqueous humor circulation system in the anterior eye. Aqueous humor is secreted by the ciliary processes and exits the eye through the trabecular meshwork (TM) or the uveoscleral outflow pathways. The TM outflow pathways provide resistance to aqueous humor outflow and IOP builds up in response to it. In the normal eye, the resistance is localized in the inner wall region, which comprises the juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT) and the inner wall endothelium of Schlemm's canal (SC). Outflow resistance in the inner wall region is lowered through the contraction of the ciliary muscle or the relaxation of contractile myofibroblasts in the posterior part of the TM and the adjacent scleral spur. Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most frequent form of glaucoma, typically suffer from an abnormally high outflow resistance of the inner wall region. There is increasing evidence that the increase in TM outflow resistance in POAG is the result of a characteristic change in the biological properties of the resident cells in the JCT, which increasingly acquire the phenotype of contractile myofibroblasts. This scenario strengthens simultaneously both their actin cytoskeleton and their directly associated extracellular matrix fibrils, leads to overall stiffening of the tissue, and is modulated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) signaling. Essentially comparable changes appear to occur in SC endothelial cells in glaucoma. Causative therapy concepts targeting the aqueous outflow pathways in glaucoma should aim at interfering with this process either by attenuating TM or SC stiffness, and/or by modulating TGF-\u03b2/CTGF signaling.

                "abstract": "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss, affecting more than 70 million individuals worldwide. Circulatory disturbances of aqueous humor (AH) have long been central pathological contributors to glaucomatous lesions. Thus, targeting the AH outflow is a promising approach to treat glaucoma. However, the epigenetic mechanisms initiating AH outflow disorders and the targeted treatments remain to be developed. Studying glaucoma patients, we identified GDF7 (growth differentiation factor 7) hypomethylation as a crucial event in the onset of AH outflow disorders. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the hypomethylated GDF7 promoter was responsible for the increased GDF7 production and secretion in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Excessive GDF7 protein promoted trabecular meshwork (TM) fibrosis through bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2)/Smad signaling and upregulated pro-fibrotic genes, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibronectin (FN). GDF7 protein expression formed a positive feedback loop in glaucomatous TM (GTM). This positive feedback loop was dependent on the activated TET (ten-eleven translocation) enzyme, which kept the GDF7 promoter region hypomethylated. The phenotypic transition in TM fortified the AH outflow resistance, thus elevating the intraocular pressure (IOP) and attenuating the nerve fiber layer. This methylation-dependent mechanism is also confirmed by a machine-learning model in silico with a specificity of 84.38% and a sensitivity of 89.38%. In rhesus monkeys, we developed GDF7 neutralization therapy to inhibit TM fibrosis and consequent AH outflow resistance that contributes to glaucoma. The neutralization therapy achieved high-efficiency control of the IOP (from 21.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.3 to 17.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.2\u00a0mmHg), a three-fold improvement in the outflow facility (from 0.1 to 0.3\u00a0\u03bcL/min \u00b7 mmHg), and protection of nerve fibers. This study provides new insights into the epigenetic mechanism of glaucoma and proposes an innovative GDF7 neutralization therapy as a promising intervention."

Methods: Six rhesus monkeys underwent PPV followed by PE/IOL. pO2, outflow facility, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured. Aqueous and vitreous humor specimens were analyzed for antioxidant status and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative damage. TM specimens were obtained for immunohistochemical and quantitative PCR analysis. Results: pO2 at baseline revealed steep gradients in the anterior chamber and low levels in the posterior chamber (PC) and around the lens. Following PPV and PE/IOL, pO2 significantly increased in the PC, around the IOL, and angle. IOP increased following both surgical interventions, with no change in outflow facility. Histopathologic analysis did not show changes in TM cell quantification, but there was an increase in 8-OHdG. Quantitative PCR did not reveal significant differences in glaucoma-related gene expression. Aqueous and vitreous humor analysis revealed decreased ascorbate and total reactive antioxidant potential and increased 8-OHdG in the aqueous humor only in the surgical eyes. Conclusions: Oxygen distribution in the older rhesus monkey is similar to humans at baseline and following surgical interventions. Our findings of histopathologic changes of TM oxidative damage and alterations in the oxidant-antioxidant balance suggest a potential correlation of increased oxygen exposure with oxidative stress/damage and the development of open angle glaucoma."

                "abstract": "The aqueous humor (AH) outflow pathways definition is still matter of intense debate. To date, the differentiation between conventional (trabecular meshwork) and unconventional (uveoscleral) pathways is widely accepted, distinguishing the different impact of the intraocular pressure on the AH outflow rate. Although the conventional route is recognized to host the main sites for intraocular pressure regulation, the unconventional pathway, with its great potential for AH resorption, seems to act as a sort of relief valve, especially when the trabecular resistance rises. Recent evidence demonstrates the presence of lymphatic channels in the eye and proposes that they may participate in the overall AH drainage and intraocular pressure regulation, in a presumably adaptive fashion. For this reason, the uveolymphatic route is increasingly thought to play an important role in the ocular hydrodynamic system physiology. As a result of the unconventional pathway characteristics, hydrodynamic disorders do not develop until the adaptive routes cannot successfully counterbalance the increased AH outflow resistance. When their adaptive mechanisms fail, glaucoma occurs. Our review deals with the standard and newly discovered AH outflow routes, with particular attention to the importance they may have in opening new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma."

To study IOP regulation, several in vitro models, such as perfusion of anterior segments or mechanical stretching of TM cells, have identified several IOP-responsive genes and proteins. While these studies have proved informative, they do not fully recapitulate the in vivo environment where IOP is subject to additional factors, such as circadian rhythms. Thus, rodent animal models are now commonly used to study IOP-responsive genes in vivo. Several single-cell RNAseq studies have been performed where angle tissue, containing cornea, iris, ciliary body tissue in addition to TM, is dissected. However, it is advantageous to physically separate TM from other tissues because the ratio of TM cells is relatively low compared to the other cell types. In this report, we describe a new technique for rat TM microdissection. Evaluating tissue post-dissection by histology and immunostaining clearly shows successful removal of the TM. In addition, TaqMan PCR primers targeting biomarkers of trabecular meshwork (Myoc, Mgp, Chi3l1) or ciliary body (Myh11, Des) genes showed little contamination of TM tissue by the ciliary body. Finally, pitfalls encountered during TM microdissection are discussed to enable others to successfully perform this microsurgical technique in the rat eye."

                "abstract": "Glaucoma, a group of optic neuropathies, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world. It is characterized by degeneration of the optic nerve and progressive visual field loss, often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of the disease, IOP occurs as a result of abnormally increased resistance to drainage of aqueous humor through the conventional outflow system, which comprises the trabecular meshwork and the Schlemm's canal. The pharmacological treatment of glaucoma has been classically aimed at lowering elevated IOP, either decreasing the production of aqueous humor or improving its outflow. Increasing knowledge of trabecular meshwork physiology shows that this tissue has unique morphologic and functional properties involved in the regulation of aqueous humor outflow. Although trabecular meshwork physiology is yet to be fully revealed, ion channels involved in cell contractility or cell volume regulation, or those capable of responding to high pressure, have been described and may be considered promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of glaucoma. The cytoskeleton architecture of the trabecular meshwork cell is thought to be an important regulator of aqueous humor outflow. Gene technology directed at discovering genes linked to the development of glaucoma or to those upregulated in response to elevated IOP is challenging research but provides an insight into future gene therapy. New tools to study trabecular meshwork physiology have recently been developed, including the use of lentivirus for gene delivery or fusion proteins with a protein transduction domain. These vectors are targeted specifically to the trabecular meshwork and are powerful techniques with broad applications for future gene therapy or as new forms of drug delivery."

                "abstract": "Obstruction of the aqueous humor outflow from the anterior chamber of the eye leads to an elevation of intraocular pressure in glaucoma, the second major cause of blindness worldwide. Our goal is to be able to modulate aqueous humor outflow resistance by gene transfer to the cells of the trabecular meshwork (TM). We have previously shown that adenoviral vectors are able to transfer a reporter gene to the TM of postmortem human donors. However, assessing gene therapy for glaucoma requires models that can monitor changes in aqueous humor outflow facility (C = flow/pressure). In this study we used four replication-deficient adenoviruses in two such perfusion models. In the first model, whole porcine eyes were infected, perfused at constant pressure and flow changes recorded for 5 h. In the second one, anterior segments from human eyes were infected, perfused at constant flow and pressure changes recorded for 3 days. A single dose of 10(8) adenovirus plaque forming units (pfu) causes a reduction in C while single doses of 10(7), 10(6) and 10(5) p.f.u. do not affect outflow facility and retain positive gene transfer. These findings indicate that adenovirus, at effective doses, could become useful vectors for gene therapy of glaucoma."

                "abstract": "Purpose: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is particularly common in older individuals and associated with pathologic degeneration of the trabecular meshwork (TM). We have shown previously that transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived TM cells restores aqueous humor dynamics in young transgenic mice expressing a pathogenic form of human myocilin (Tg-MYOCY437H). This study was designed to determine if this approach is feasible in older mice with more pronounced TM dysfunction. Methods: Mouse iPSC were differentiated toward a TM cell phenotype (iPSC-TM) and injected into the anterior chamber of 6-month-old Tg-MYOCY437H or control mice. IOP and aqueous humor outflow facility were recorded for up to 3 months. Transmission electron microscopy, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to analyze TM morphology, quantify endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and assess TM cellularity. Results: A 12 weeks after transplantation, IOP in iPSC-TM recipients was statistically lower and outflow facility was significantly improved compared to untreated controls. The number of endogenous TM cells increased significantly in iPSC-TM recipients along with the appearance of TM cells immmunopositive for a marker of cellular division. Morphologically, transplantation of iPSC-TM preserves ER structure 12 weeks after transplantation. However, myocilin and calnexin expression levels remain elevated in transplanted eyes of these 9-month-old Tg-MYOCY437H mice, indicating that ER stress persists within the TM. Conclusions: Transplantation of iPSC-TM can restore IOP and outflow facility in aged Tg-MYOCY437H mice. This type of stem cell-based therapy is a promising possibility for restoration of IOP control in some glaucoma patients."

                "abstract": "The eye is innervated by numerous serotonergic nerves and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) is present in the aqueous humor of animal and human eyes. In an effort to delineate the role of the serotonergic system in modulating intraocular pressure (IOP) within the anterior segment of the eye, extensive topical ocular dosing studies were conducted with a variety of 5HT ligands and in various animal species. Even though certain 5HT(1A) agonists decreased IOP in rabbits, these compounds failed to affect IOP in normotensive or ocular hypertensive monkey eyes. In contrast, while 5HT(2) agonists induced significant IOP reductions in normotensive rat eyes and in eyes of ocular hypertensive Cynomolgus monkeys, these agents were inactive in ocular normotensive cats and rabbits. Additional studies indicated a strong involvement of 5HT(2A) receptors in mediating IOP-lowering in conscious ocular hypertensive Cynomolgus monkeys. As a result of further structure-activity investigations, AL-34662, a selective 5HT(2) agonist (relative to other 5HT receptor types and sub-types) with high affinity, potency and efficacy at 5HT(2A), 5HT(2B) and 5HT(2C) receptors was discovered that efficaciously lowered IOP in the monkey model of ocular hypertension (33 +/- 3 % reduction out to 6 hrs post with a 300 microg topical ocular dose). Due to unavailability of monkey ocular cells, extensive in vitro studies were conducted using relevant human ocular cells in order to correlate with and support the in vivo observations in the monkeys. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of mRNAs for 5HT(2A-C) receptor subtypes in human ocular tissues involved in IOP modulation. The relative distribution and density of these mRNAs were as follows: ciliary body (CB) (5HT(2A) > 5HT(2B) > 5HT(2C)), ciliary epithelium (CE) (5HT(2A) > 5HT(2B) = 5HT(2C)) and trabecular meshwork (TM) (5HT(2A)= 5HT(2B) >> 5HT(2C)). Furthermore, quantitative autoradiography revealed a relatively high specific binding of [(3)H]-5HT and [(3)H]-ketanserin to 5HT(2) receptors in human CE and longitudinal ciliary muscle (CM). Second messenger studies revealed the presence of phospholipase C-coupled 5HT(2A) receptors in h-CM and h-TM cells where they stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) when challenged with a variety of 5HT(2A-C) receptor agonists (e.g. alpha-methyl-5HT, (R)-DOI, alpha-methyl-5HT, BW-723C86, MK-212, mCPP, cabergoline, AL-34662). These functional responses were blocked by selective 5HT(2) receptor antagonists with the 5HT(2A) antagonist, M-100970, exhibiting the highest potency. Thus, functional 5HT(2A) receptors are present in human ocular cells involved in IOP reduction and this correlates with the ability of 5HT(2A) agonists to lower IOP in Cynomolgus monkeys, a surrogate for human subjects."

                "abstract": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for the onset and progression of glaucoma. IOP reduction has been proven effective in the treatment of glaucoma. IOP is controlled by the production and outflow of the aqueous humor (AH), and the trabecular meshwork (TM) is the main pathway for AH drainage from the eye. However, there are few conventional IOP-lowering treatments that target TM, and there is a need for such treatments. In this study, we screened for the expression level of fibronectin as an indicator and identified an activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 5 inhibitor. Western blot analysis showed that SB431542, an ALK 5 inhibitor, reduced fibronectin and \u03b1-SMA expression. Moreover, a single dose of the ALK5 inhibitor SB431542 reduced IOP in mice, and the IOP-lowering effect of the ALK5 inhibitor was greater than that of a Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). Repeated dosing with ALK5 inhibitor eye drops (once daily) enhanced the murine IOP-lowering effect. Furthermore, ALK5 inhibition decreased the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) mRNA and suppressed ECM production. These findings suggest that ALK5 inhibitors may contribute to the development of new treatments for glaucoma that target the TM."

The respective impact of optic nerve demyelination and primary and secondary retinal neurodegeneration are yet to be investigated in animal models. METHODS: Active MOG35-55 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6Jrj mice, and monoclonal MOG-IgG (8-18C5, murine), recombinant AQP4-IgG (rAb-53, human), or isotype-matched control IgG (Iso-IgG, human) was administered 10 days postimmunization. Mobility impairment was scored daily. Visual acuity by optomotor reflex and ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC, 3 innermost retinal layers) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were longitudinally assessed. Histopathology of optic nerve and retina was investigated during presymptomatic, acute, and chronic disease phases for immune cells, demyelination, complement deposition, natural killer (NK) cell, AQP4, and astrocyte involvement, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and M\u00fcller cell activation. Groups were compared by nonparametric tests with a p value <0.05 indicating statistical significance. RESULTS: Visual acuity decreased from baseline to chronic phase in MOG-IgG (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean: 0.54 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.46 \u00b1 0.02 cycles/degree, p < 0.05) and AQP4-IgG EAE (0.54 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.43 \u00b1 0.02, cycles/degree, p < 0.05). Immune cell infiltration of optic nerves started in presymptomatic AQP4-IgG, but not in MOG-IgG EAE (5.85 \u00b1 2.26 vs 0.13 \u00b1 0.10 macrophages/region of interest [ROI] and 1.88 \u00b1 0.63 vs 0.15 \u00b1 0.06 T cells/ROI, both p < 0.05). Few NK cells, no complement deposition, and stable glial fibrillary acid protein and AQP4 fluorescence intensity characterized all EAE optic nerves. Lower GCC thickness (Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.44, p < 0.05) and RGC counts (r = -0.47, p < 0.05) correlated with higher mobility impairment. RGCs decreased from presymptomatic to chronic disease phase in MOG-IgG (1,705 \u00b1 51 vs 1,412 \u00b1 45, p < 0.05) and AQP4-IgG EAE (1,758 \u00b1 14 vs 1,526 \u00b1 48, p < 0.01). M\u00fcller cell activation was not observed in either model. DISCUSSION: In a multimodal longitudinal characterization of visual outcome in animal models of MOGAD and NMOSD, differential retinal injury and optic nerve involvement were not conclusively clarified. Yet optic nerve inflammation was earlier in AQP4-IgG-associated pathophysiology. Retinal atrophy determined by GCC thickness (OCT) and RGC counts correlating with mobility impairment in the chronic phase of MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG EAE may serve as a generalizable marker of neurodegeneration."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disorder (MOGAD) is a rare, autoimmune demyelinating CNS disorder, distinct from multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Characterized by pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against MOG, a potential treatment strategy for MOGAD is to reduce circulating IgG levels, e.g., by interference with the IgG recycling pathway mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Although the optic nerve is often detrimentally involved in MOGAD, the effect of FcRn blockade on the visual pathway has not been assessed. Our objective was to investigate effects of a monoclonal anti-FcRn antibody in murine MOG-IgG-associated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: We induced active MOG35-55 EAE in C57Bl/6 mice followed by the application of a monoclonal MOG-IgG (8-18C5) 10 days postimmunization (dpi). Animals were treated with either a specific monoclonal antibody against FcRn (\u03b1-FcRn, 4470) or an isotype-matched control IgG on 7, 10, and 13 dpi. Neurologic disability was scored daily on a 10-point scale. Visual acuity was assessed by optomotor reflex. Histopathologic hallmarks of disease were assessed in the spinal cord, optic nerve, and retina. Immune cell infiltration was visualized by immunohistochemistry, demyelination by Luxol fast blue staining and complement deposition and number of retinal ganglion cells by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In MOG-IgG-augmented MOG35-55 EAE, anti-FcRn treatment significantly attenuated neurologic disability over the course of disease (mean area under the curve and 95% confidence intervals (CIs): \u03b1-FcRn [n = 27], 46.02 [37.89-54.15]; isotype IgG [n = 24], 66.75 [59.54-73.96], 3 independent experiments), correlating with reduced amounts of demyelination and macrophage infiltration into the spinal cord. T- and B-cell infiltration and complement deposition remained unchanged. Compared with isotype, anti-FcRn treatment prevented reduction of visual acuity over the course of disease (median cycles/degree and interquartile range: \u03b1-FcRn [n = 16], 0.50 [0.48-0.55] to 0.50 [0.48-0.58]; isotype IgG [n = 17], 0.50 [0.49-0.54] to 0.45 [0.39-0.51]). DISCUSSION: We show preserved optomotor response and ameliorated course of disease after anti-FcRn treatment in an experimental model using a monoclonal MOG-IgG to mimic MOGAD. Selectively targeting FcRn might represent a promising therapeutic approach in MOGAD."

We used double-transgenic (2D2/Th) mice which develop a spontaneous opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE). Retinal morphology and its function were evaluated via spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and electroretinography (ERG) in 6- and 8-week-old mice. Immunohistochemistry of retina and optic nerve and examination of the retina via RT-qPCR were performed using markers for inflammation, immune cells and the complement pathway. OSE mice showed clinical signs of encephalomyelitis with an incidence of 75% at day 38. A progressive retinal thinning was detected in OSE mice via SD-OCT. An impairment in photoreceptor signal transmission occurred. This was accompanied by cellular infiltration and demyelination of optic nerves. The number of microglia/macrophages was increased in OSE optic nerves and retinas. Analysis of the retina revealed a reduced retinal ganglion cell number and downregulated Pou4f1 mRNA expression in OSE retinas. RT-qPCR revealed an elevation of microglia markers and the cytokines Tnfa and Tgfb. We also documented an upregulation of the complement system via the classical pathway. In summary, we describe characteristics of inflammation and degeneration of the visual system in a spontaneous encephalomyelitis model, characterized by coinciding inflammatory and degenerative mechanisms in both retina and optic nerve with involvement of the complement system."

In this study, we aimed to establish a model of NMOSD-related optic neuritis (NMOSD-ON) and to evaluate the progressive changes of the optic nerve and visual function. AQP4 IgG-positive serum from NMOSD patients was injected into the subarachnoid space of the rat optic nerve to induce the NMOSD-ON model (AQP4\u00a0+\u00a0group), and healthy serum was injected as the control. The visual evoked potential, pupillary light reflex and optical coherence tomography were monitored every week for 3 weeks after induction. Compared with the control group, the amplitude of the N1-P1 peak and pupillary light reflex in the AQP4+ group were reduced within the first week and then remained low thereafter. Consistent with the functional deficits, the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in the AQP4\u00a0+\u00a0group was also greatly reduced. At the end of 3 weeks, there was a loss of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerves showed characteristic NMOSD-like pathologic changes, including deposition of AQP4 IgG, local astrocyte damage, demyelination, microglia activation, macrophage infiltration and axonal injury. Thus, we have established an NMOSD-ON rat model with deficits in the optic nerve and visual function that may be a valuable tool for exploring the mechanism of NMOSD-ON and evaluating its potential therapeutic treatment."

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is an oligodendrocytopathy with a similar phenotype. Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP), an astrocyte-derived protein, is associated with disease severity in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Serum neurofilament light (sNfL) indicates neuroaxonal damage. The objective was to investigate the association of sGFAP and sNfL with subclinical afferent visual system damage in clinically stable AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD and MOGAD patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, clinically stable patients with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (N\u00a0=\u00a033) and MOGAD (N\u00a0=\u00a016), as diseased controls, underwent sGFAP and sNfL measurements by single molecule array, retinal optical coherence tomography and visually evoked potentials. RESULTS: Higher sGFAP concentrations were associated with thinner ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (\u03b2 (95% confidence interval (CI))\u00a0=\u00a0-0.75 (-1.23 to -0.27), p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and shallower fovea (average pit depth: \u03b2 (95%CI)\u00a0=\u00a0-0.59 (-0.63 to -0.55), p\u00a0=\u00a00.020) in NMOSD non-ON eyes.

In MOGAD, sGFAP was not associated with retinal structural or visual functional measures. CONCLUSIONS: The association of sGFAP with structural and functional markers of afferent visual system damage in absence of ON suggests that sGFAP may be a sensitive biomarker for chronic disease severity in clinically stable AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuro-axonal injury is a key contributor to non-reversible long-term disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Visual impairment is common among MS patients, in which episodes of optic neuritis (ON) are often followed by structural retinal damage and sustained functional impairment. Alterations in the optic nerve and retina have also been described in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS. Thus, investigating structural anterior visual pathway damage may constitute a unique model for assessing mechanisms and temporal sequence of neurodegeneration in MS. We used a multimodal imaging approach utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore the mechanisms and temporal dynamics of visual pathway damage in the animal model of MS. METHODS: 7 EAE-MOG35-55 and 5 healthy female C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness was derived from an OCT volume scan centred over the optic nerve head, while the structure of the optic nerve and tracts was assessed from DTI and co-registered T2-weighted sequences performed on a 7T MRI scanner. Data was acquired at baseline, disease onset, peak of disease and recovery. Linear mixed effect models were used to account for intra-subject, inter-eye dependencies, group and time point. Correlation analyses assessed the relationship between GCC thickness and DTI parameters. Immunofluorescence staining of retina and optic nerve sections was used to assess distribution of marker proteins for microglia and neurodegeneration (nerve filaments). RESULTS: In EAE mice, a significant increase in GCC thickness was observed at disease onset (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) followed by a decrease at recovery (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) compared to controls. The EAE group had significant GCC thinning at recovery compared to all other time points (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 for each). Signal increase on T2-weighted images around the optic nerves indicative of inflammation was seen in most of the EAE mice but in none of the controls. A significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase in radial diffusivity (RD) values in EAE optic nerves (AD: p\u202f=\u202f0.02, RD: p\u202f=\u202f0.01) and tract (AD: p\u202f=\u202f0.02, RD: p\u202f=\u202f0.006) was observed compared to controls. GCC at recovery was positively correlated with AD (optic nerve: rho\u202f=\u202f0.74, p\u202f=\u202f0.04, optic tract: rho\u202f=\u202f0.74, p\u202f=\u202f0.04) and negatively correlated with RD (optic nerve: rho\u202f=\u202f-0.80, p\u202f=\u202f0.02, optic tract: rho\u202f=\u202f-0.75, p\u202f=\u202f0.04). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated the presence of activated microglia in the retina and optic nerves in addition to astrocytosis and axonal degeneration in the optic nerve of EAE mice. CONCLUSION: OCT detected GCC changes in EAE may resemble what is observed in MS-related acute ON: an initial phase of swelling (indicative of inflammatory edema) followed by a decrease in thickness over time (representative of neuro-axonal degeneration). In line with OCT findings, DTI of the visual pathway identifies EAE induced pathology (decreased AD, and increased RD). Immunofluorescence analysis provides support for inflammatory pathology and axonal degeneration. OCT together with DTI can detect retinal and optic nerve damage and elucidate to the temporal sequence of neurodegeneration in this rodent model of MS in vivo."

RESULTS: Twelve patients with MOGAD (20 eyes with ON-involvement) and 14 with AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD (16 eyes with ON-involvement) were enrolled. The progression of retinal atrophy \u226512\u00a0months after onset was observed in AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD, but was not apparent in MOGAD. A decrease in retinal thickness by the same amount results in more severe visual impairment in AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD. On optic MRI, the residual STIR hyperintensity in the optic nerves remained in the chronic phase in almost all eyes with ON in both diseases. Optic nerve atrophy occurred in all evaluated ON-involved eyes in AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD, while it was observed in half of ON-involved eyes in MOGAD. CONCLUSIONS: Progression of retinal atrophy in the chronic phase has been observed in patients with AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD, while it remains uncertain in patients with MOGAD. The visual impairments upon similar levels of retinal atrophy would be worse in AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD, possibly attributable in part to a higher incidence of optic nerve atrophy in this disease."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) have been reported in patients with aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG)-negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). The objective of this study was to describe optic neuritis (ON)-induced neuro-axonal damage in the retina of MOG-IgG-positive patients in comparison with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD patients. METHODS: Afferent visual system damage following ON was bilaterally assessed in 16 MOG-IgG-positive patients with a history of ON and compared with that in 16 AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD patients. In addition, 16 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and disease duration were analyzed. Study data included ON history, retinal optical coherence tomography, visual acuity, and visual evoked potentials. RESULTS: Eight MOG-IgG-positive patients had a previous diagnosis of AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD with ON and myelitis, and eight of (mainly recurrent) ON. Twenty-nine of the 32 eyes of the MOG-IgG-positive patients had been affected by at least one episode of ON. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (pRNFL) and ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer volume (GCIP) were significantly reduced in ON eyes of MOG-IgG-positive patients (pRNFL\u2009=\u200959\u2009\u00b1\u200923\u00a0\u03bcm; GCIP\u2009=\u20091.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34\u00a0mm3) compared with healthy controls (pRNFL\u2009=\u200999\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0\u03bcm, p\u2009<\u20090.001; GCIP\u2009=\u20091.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u00a0mm3, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Visual acuity was impaired in eyes after ON in MOG-IgG-positive patients (0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.88 logMAR). There were no significant differences in any structural or functional visual parameters between MOG-IgG-positive and AQP4-IgG-positive patients (pRNFL: 59\u2009\u00b1\u200921\u00a0\u03bcm; GCIP: 1.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27\u00a0mm3; Visual acuity\u2009=\u20090.72\u2009\u00b1\u20091.09 logMAR). Importantly, MOG-IgG-positive patients had a significantly higher annual ON relapse rate than AQP4-IgG-positive patients (median 0.69 vs. 0.29 attacks/year, p\u2009=\u20090.004), meaning that on average a single ON episode caused less damage in MOG-IgG-positive than in AQP4-IgG-positive patients. pRNFL and GCIP loss correlated with the number of ON episodes in MOG-IgG-positive patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not in AQP4-IgG-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal neuro-axonal damage and visual impairment after ON in MOG-IgG-positive patients are as severe as in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD patients. In MOG-IgG-positive patients, damage accrual may be driven by higher relapse rates, whereas AQP4-IgG-positive patients showed fewer but more severe episodes of ON. Given the marked damage in some of our MOG-IgG-positive patients, early diagnosis and timely initiation and close monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy are important."

Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) we assessed whether MOG-abs might serve as potential marker of retinal axonal degeneration. We investigated a clinically heterogeneous cohort of 13 MOG-abs-positive patients (4 MOG-abs-positive rON, 4 MOG-abs-positive adult MS, 3 MOG-abs-positive relapsing encephalomyelitis, 2 MOG-abs-positive aquaporin-4-abs-negative NMOSD). As controls, we studied 13 age, sex and ON episode(s)-matched MOG-abs and aquaporin-4-abs-negative (AQP4-abs-negative) MS patients and 13 healthy controls (HC). In addition, we investigated 19 unmatched AQP4-abs-positive MOG-abs-negative NMOSD subjects. Considering all eyes, global pRNFL [in \u00b5m, mean (SD)] was significantly reduced in MOG-abs-positive patients [72.56 (22.71)] compared to MOG-abs-negative MS [80.81 (13.55), p\u00a0=\u00a00.0128], HCs [103.54 (8.529), p\u00a0=\u00a00.0014] and NMOSD [88.32 (18.43), p\u00a0=\u00a00.0353]. Non ON eyes from MOG-abs-positive subjects showed significant subclinical atrophy of temporal pRNFL quadrants. Microcystic macular edema (MME) was observed only in eyes of MOG-abs-positive (24%) and AQP4-abs-positive NMOSD (5.6%), but not in MOG-abs-negative MS or HC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). MOG-abs may serve as potential marker of retinal degeneration. Specifically, MOG-abs-related OCT features predominate in temporal pRNFL quadrants (resembling the MS retinal pattern), might be more severe than AQP4-abs-positive NMOSD, indicate subclinical pathology, and may be associated with MME."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: To identify the retina-structural and visual-functional alterations in the patients with aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-associated disease (MOGAD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, all of whom had demyelinating transverse myelitis (TM) without optic neuritis (ON). METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we reviewed the medical records of 97 patients, including 23 with AQP4-ON, 13 with AQP4-TM, 32 with MOG-ON, 3 with MOG-TM, 13 with MS-ON, and 13 with MS-TM. We measured the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) using optical coherence tomography to evaluate structural changes and compared these parameters with those of an age-matched healthy control. Functional outcomes were measured as visual acuity and mean deviation in visual field test. RESULTS: Mean RNFL and GCIPL thicknesses in all of the patients with TM were lower relative to the healthy control, while visual function was well preserved. Among the TM patients, RNFL thickness did not vary significantly among the groups, whereas GCIPL thickness in AQP4-TM and MS-TM was significantly lower than that in MOG-TM. All three TM groups showed significant mean RNFL reduction compared with the healthy control, whereas mean GCIPL thinning was evident only in AQP4-TM and MS-TM, not in MOG-TM. CONCLUSION: Patients with demyelinating TM incur retina-microstructural damage that varies by specific disease entity. Damage is distinct in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD and MS, but it is not so severe as to cause functional damage."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-NMOSD), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) may have overlapping clinical features. There is an unmet need for imaging markers that differentiate between them when serologic testing is unavailable or ambiguous. We assessed whether imaging characteristics typical of MS discriminate RRMS from AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD, alone and in combination. METHODS: Adult, nonacute patients with RRMS, APQ4-NMOSD, and MOGAD and healthy controls were prospectively recruited at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (London, United Kingdom) and the Walton Centre (Liverpool, United Kingdom) between 2014 and 2019. They underwent conventional and advanced brain, cord, and optic nerve MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: A total of 91 consecutive patients (31 RRMS, 30 APQ4-NMOSD, and 30 MOGAD) and 34 healthy controls were recruited. The most accurate measures differentiating RRMS from AQP4-NMOSD were the proportion of lesions with the central vein sign (CVS) (84% vs 33%, accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 91/88/93%, p < 0.001), followed by cortical lesions (median: 2 [range: 1-14] vs 1 [0-1], accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 84/90/77%, p = 0.002) and white matter lesions (mean: 39.07 [\u00b125.8] vs 9.5 [\u00b114], accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 78/84/73%, p = 0.001). The combination of higher proportion of CVS, cortical lesions, and optic nerve magnetization transfer ratio reached the highest accuracy in distinguishing RRMS from AQP4-NMOSD (accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 95/92/97%, p < 0.001). The most accurate measures favoring RRMS over MOGAD were white matter lesions (39.07 [\u00b125.8] vs 1 [\u00b12.3], accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 94/94/93%, p = 0.006), followed by cortical lesions (2 [1-14] vs 1 [0-1], accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 84/97/71%, p = 0.004), and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) (mean: 87.54 [\u00b113.83] vs 75.54 [\u00b120.33], accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 80/79/81%, p = 0.009). Higher cortical lesion number combined with higher RNFL thickness best differentiated RRMS from MOGAD (accuracy/specificity/sensitivity: 84/92/77%, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Cortical lesions, CVS, and optic nerve markers achieve a high accuracy in distinguishing RRMS from APQ4-NMOSD and MOGAD. This information may be useful in clinical practice, especially outside the acute phase and when serologic testing is ambiguous or not promptly available. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that selected conventional and advanced brain, cord, and optic nerve MRI and OCT markers distinguish adult patients with RRMS from AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD."

                "title": "Loss of Nrf2 exacerbates the visual deficits and optic neuritis elicited by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.",
                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Optic neuritis, inflammation of the optic nerve, is experienced by most patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is typically characterized by episodes of acute, monocular vision loss. These episodes of inflammation can lead to damage or degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the axons of which comprise the optic nerve. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-established model of MS in which mice are immunized to produce a neuroautoimmunity that recapitulates the cardinal hallmarks of human disease, namely, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Inflammation-associated oxidative stress plays a key role in promoting spinal cord damage in EAE. However, the role of oxidative stress in optic neuritis and the associated visual deficits has not been studied. To address this gap in research, we sought to determine how a deficiency in the master antioxidant transcription factor (using nuclear factor-E2-related factor [Nrf2]-deficient mice) affects visual pathology in the EAE model. METHODS: EAE was induced in 8-week-old wild-type (WT) and Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice by immunization against the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide antigen. Motor deficits were monitored daily, as was visual acuity using the established functional optokinetic tracking (OKT) assay. Mice were euthanized 21 days post-immunization for histological analyses. The optic nerves were paraffin-embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or immune cell type-specific antibodies to analyze inflammatory infiltrates. The retinas were flatmounted and stained with an RGC-specific antibody, and the RGCs were counted to assess neurodegeneration. T-helper (Th) cell-associated cytokines were measured in spleens with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immune analyses of healthy, non-EAE mice were characterized with flow cytometry to assess the baseline immune cell profiles. RESULTS: Female Nrf2 KO mice exhibited more severe EAE-induced motor deficits compared with female WT mice. In both genders, EAE elicited more severe visual acuity deficits, inflammation of the optic nerve, and RGC degeneration in KO mice compared with their strain- and age-matched WT counterparts. Visual acuity deficits were primarily present in (and only exacerbated in) one eye of each mouse. Excess inflammatory cells within the optic nerves of the KO mice were primarily comprised of T-cells, and greater RGC degeneration in the KO mice was most prevalent in the central retina compared with the peripheral retina. Nrf2 KO spleens exhibited an increased Th1- but not Th17-associated immune response. This enhanced pathology in the KO mice was not due to global differences in immune system development between the two genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that genetic ablation of Nrf2 exacerbates visual deficits, inflammation of the optic nerve, and RGC degeneration in a murine model of MS, suggesting that Nrf2 plays a neuro- and cytoprotective role in EAE-associated optic neuritis."

METHODS: Children displaying initial onset of optic neuritis (ON) were recruited from the Neuro-ophthalmology Department in the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital from January 2016 to August 2017. They were assigned into three groups based on antibody status: MOG-Ab-seropositive ON (MOG-ON), aquaporin-4 antibody-seropositive ON (AQP4-ON) and double seronegative ON (seronegative-ON). RESULTS: Totally 48 patients were assessed, including 25 MOG-ON (52.1%), 7 AQP4-ON (14.6%) and 16 seronegative-ON (33.3%). The MOG-ON and seronegative-ON cohorts had equal ratios of female/male, but the AQP4-ON cohort was predominantly females (100%). The patients with\u00a0MOG-ON were significantly younger at onset compared with the AQP4-ON group. Of the MOG-ON eyes, 97.6% had good recovery of visual acuity (VA)\u00a0(\u22650.5) compared with33.3% of AQP4-ON eyes (p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference compared with the seronegative-ON eyes (82.6%, p=0.052). Two children in the MOG-ON group ended up being diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, while only one patient in the AQP4-ON group developed neuromyelitis optica during follow-up. Patients with\u00a0MOG-ON had thicker peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layers overall and in the superior and inferior quadrants than in patients with\u00a0AQP4-ON (p=0.005, p=0.002 and p=0.024, respectively). In addition, the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform in MOG-ON eyes became significantly thicker than in AQP4-ON eyes (p=0.029). Orbital MRI revealed a larger proportion of patients with\u00a0MOG-ON had intracranial optic nerve involvement than patients with\u00a0seronegative-ON (51.2% vs 17.4%, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: MOG-ON was the most common PON subtype in China. MOG-ON had different clinical features including earlier age of onset, equal female/male ratio, better recovery of VA and thicker peripapillary retinal nerve fibre and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layers. MOG-Abs may be a potential biomarker for determining visual prognosis with PON."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Devic's neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune astrocytopathy, associated with central nervous system inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal injury. Several studies confirmed that autoantibodies directed against aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) are relevant in the pathogenesis of NMO, mainly through complement-dependent toxicity leading to astrocyte death. However, the effect of the autoantibody per se and the exact role of intrathecal AQP4-IgG are still controversial. METHODS: To explore the intrinsic effect of intrathecal AQP4-IgG, independent from additional inflammatory effector mechanisms, and to evaluate its clinical impact, we developed a new animal model, based on a prolonged infusion of purified immunoglobulins from NMO patient (IgG(AQP4+), NMO-rat) and healthy individual as control (Control-rat) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of live rats. RESULTS: We showed that CSF infusion of purified immunoglobulins led to diffusion in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves, the targeted structures in NMO. This was associated with astrocyte alteration in NMO-rats characterized by loss of aquaporin-4 expression in the spinal cord and the optic nerves compared to the Control-rats (p\u2009=\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). In addition, glutamate uptake tested on vigil rats was dramatically reduced in NMO-rats (p\u2009=\u20090.001) suggesting that astrocytopathy occurred in response to AQP4-IgG diffusion. In parallel, myelin was altered, as shown by the decrease of myelin basic protein staining by up to 46 and 22\u00a0% in the gray and white matter of the NMO-rats spinal cord, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Loss of neurofilament positive axons in NMO-rats (p\u2009=\u20090.003) revealed alteration of axonal integrity. Then, we investigated the clinical consequences of such alterations on the motor behavior of the NMO-rats. In a rotarod test, NMO-rats performance was lower compared to the controls (p\u2009=\u20090.0182). AQP4 expression, and myelin and axonal integrity were preserved in AQP4-IgG-depleted condition. We did not find a major immune cell infiltration and microglial activation nor complement deposition in the central nervous system, in our model. CONCLUSIONS: We establish a link between motor-deficit, NMO-like lesions and astrocytopathy mediated by intrathecal AQP4-IgG. Our study validates the concept of the intrinsic effect of autoantibody against surface antigens and offers a model for testing antibody and astrocyte-targeted therapies in NMO."

We aimed to investigate retina thickness in eyes of aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G antibody seropositive (AQP4-IgG+) NMOSD patients with optic neuritis (AQP4-ON) and without (AQP4-NON). METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase. Mean difference (MD, \u03bcm) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled with random-effect models. The primary measures were average thickness of peripapillar retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) centered on optic disc and the combination of ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) at macula. RESULTS: We included 21 studies enrolling 787 AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD patients. Compared with healthy control, pRNFL was thinner in eyes of AQP4-ON (- 32.78, 95% CI [- 36.24, - 29.33]) and AQP4-NON (- 2.76, 95% CI [- 3.94, - 1.58]), so was GICPL in AQP4-ON (-21.38, 95% CI [- 24.01, - 18.74]) and AQP4-NON (95% CI - 2.96, [- 3.91, - 2.00]). Compared with multiple sclerosis with ON, AQP4-ON had thinner pRNFL (- 13.56, 95%CI [- 16.51, - 10.60]) and GCIPL (- 9.12, 95% CI [- 11.88, - 6.36]). AQP4-ON and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination with ON (MOG-ON) had similar pRNFL (0.59, 95% CI [- 6.61, 7.79]) and GCIPL thickness (- 0.55, 95% CI [- 2.92, 1.82]). AQP4-NON had similar pRNFL and GCIPL thickness to MOG-NON and multiple sclerosis without ON. CONCLUSIONS: The average thickness of pRNFL and GICPL decreased both in AQP4-ON and AQP4-NON eyes. AQP4-ON eyes had a similar level of pRNFL and GICPL thinning to MOG-ON eyes, so did AQP4-NON to MOG-NON eyes."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) refers to a range of autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating diseases affecting the optic nerves, spinal cord, and periependymal regions of the brain. Classical NMOSD is characterized by the presentation of autoantibodies against the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). However, a subset of patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for NMOSD is negative for AQP4-IgG but positive for autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG); these patients are associated with different clinical manifestations and pathogenesis. METHODS: Patients who received a first diagnosis of NMOSD were reviewed retrospectively between April 2015 and December 2018. Patients were classified according to the presence of AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging findings, disease severity, and serum C3 and C4 levels at the first episode were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The NMOSD patients with AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG demonstrated specific, differential clinical features. The AQP4-IgG group featured more women, the presentation of transverse myelitis attacks and simultaneous occurrence of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis were more common, and intrathecal synthesis was more evident. The MOG-IgG group featured younger patients, more acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or ADEM-like attacks, more frequent cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and a better overall outcome. C3 levels were significantly lower in AQP4-IgG-positive patients and higher in MOG-IgG-positive patients relative to healthy controls. C4 levels were significantly lower in the AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD group when compared to both MOG-IgG-positive patients and controls. C3 and C4 were then combined in a receiver operating characteristic model. The area under the curve of the model was calculated to differentiate the AQP4-IgG-positive group from the MOG-IgG-positive group was 0.787, which was considered moderately predictive. CONCLUSION: The combination of C3 and C4 could assist in the differential diagnosis of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD from MOG-IgG-positive NMOSD."

MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG, mostly of the IgG1 subtype, can both activate the complement system. Therefore, we investigated whether the levels of serum complement components, regulators, and activation products differ between MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD, and if complement analytes can be utilized to differentiate between these diseases. Methods: The sera of patients with MOGAD (from during an attack and remission; N=19 and N=9, respectively) and AQP4-NMOSD (N=35 and N=17), and healthy controls (N=38) were analyzed for C1q-binding circulating immune complex (CIC-C1q), C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), factor H (FH), C3, iC3b, and soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9). Results: In attack samples, the levels of C1-INH, FH, and iC3b were higher in the MOGAD group than in the NMOSD group (all, p<0.001), while the level of sC5b-9 was increased only in the NMOSD group. In MOGAD, there were no differences in the concentrations of complement analytes based on disease status. However, within AQP4-NMOSD, remission samples indicated a higher C1-INH level than attack samples (p=0.003). Notably, AQP4-NMOSD patients on medications during attack showed lower levels of iC3b (p<0.001) and higher levels of C3 (p=0.008), C1-INH (p=0.004), and sC5b-9 (p<0.001) compared to those not on medication. Among patients not on medication at the time of attack sampling, serum MOG-IgG cell-based assay (CBA) score had a positive correlation with iC3b and C1-INH levels (rho=0.764 and p=0.010, and rho=0.629 and p=0.049, respectively), and AQP4-IgG CBA score had a positive correlation with C1-INH level (rho=0.836, p=0.003). Conclusions: This study indicates a higher prominence of complement pathway activation and subsequent C3 degradation in MOGAD compared to AQP4-NMOSD. On the other hand, the production of terminal complement complexes (TCC) was found to be more substantial in AQP4-NMOSD than in MOGAD. These findings suggest a strong regulation of the complement system, implying its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of MOGAD through mechanisms that extend beyond TCC formation."

In this study, we compared the clinical characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis parameters, and peripheral T/B lymphocyte subsets during the active and chronic phases in AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD. METHODS: A total of 17 MOGAD cases and 24 AQP4-NMOSD cases were studied. The clinical characteristics in both groups were summarized, including disease duration, total number of attacks, lesions, prevention of relapse during remission, and CSF analysis results during the active phase. T/B lymphocyte subsets were further investigated in the active and chronic phases. RESULTS: In the comparative study on clinical symptoms, a large proportion of optic neuritis was unilateral in MOGAD. In the comparative study on CSF analysis, protein level was significantly lower in MOGAD compared with AQP4-NMOSD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006); myelin basic protein was significantly lower in MOGAD compared with AQP4-NMOSD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04); albumin quotient was significantly lower in MOGAD compared with AQP4-NMOSD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02); and IgG Quotient was significantly lower in MOGAD compared with AQP4-NMOSD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). In the analysis of T/B lymphocyte subsets, plasmablasts of the B cell subset in the active phase were significantly lower in MOGAD (2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4) compared to AQP4-NMOSD (7.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the chronic phase, transitional B cells were significantly higher in MOGAD (2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8) compared to AQP4-NMOSD (0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics of MOGAD were similar to those of AQP4-NMOSD, but increased blood brain barrier permeability was suggested to be less severe in MOGAD compared to AQP4-NMOSD from CSF analysis. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of the two diseases was clearly distinct as plasmablasts in the active phase were not elevated in MOGAD, but were increased in AQP4-NMOSD."

                "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease associated with recurrent episodes of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, often resulting in permanent blindness and/or paralysis. The discovery of autoantibodies (AQP4-IgG) that target aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has accelerated our understanding of the cellular mechanisms driving NMO pathogenesis. AQP4 is a bidirectional water channel expressed on the plasma membranes of astrocytes, retinal M\u00fcller cells, skeletal muscle, and some epithelial cells in kidney, lung and the gastrointestinal tract. AQP4 tetramers form regular supramolecular assemblies at the cell plasma membrane called orthogonal arrays of particles. The pathological features of NMO include perivascular deposition of immunoglobulin and activated complement, loss of astrocytic AQP4, inflammatory infiltration with granulocyte and macrophage accumulation, and demyelination with axon loss. Current evidence supports a causative role of AQP4-IgG in NMO, in which binding of AQP4-IgG to AQP4 orthogonal arrays on astrocytes initiates complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and inflammation. Immunosuppression and plasma exchange are the mainstays of therapy for NMO optic neuritis. Novel therapeutics targeting specific steps in NMO pathogenesis are entering the development pipeline, including blockers of AQP4-IgG binding to AQP4 and inhibitors of granulocyte function. However, much work remains in understanding the unique susceptibility of the optic nerves in NMO, in developing animal models of NMO optic neuritis, and in improving therapies to preserve vision. "

                "abstract": "Background: Optic neuritis (ON) is an important clinical manifestation of neuromyelitis optic spectrum disease (NMOSD). Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-related and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody-related ON show different disease patterns. The aim of this study was to explore the differences in structure and function of the visual pathway in patients with ON associated with MOG and AQP4 antibodies. Methods: In this prospective study, we recruited 52 subjects at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, including 11 with MOG Ig+ ON (MOG-ON), 13 with AQP4 Ig+ ON (AQP4-ON), and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of optic radiation (OR), primary visual cortex volume (V1), brain volume, and visual acuity (VA) were compared among groups. A multiple linear regression was used to explore associations between VA and predicted factors. In addition, we used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to examine thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and retinal ganglion cell complex (GCC) in a separate cohort consisting of 15 patients with ON (8 MOG-ON and 7 AQP4-ON) and 28 HCs. Results: Diffusion tensor imaging showed that the FA of OR was lower than controls in patients with AQP4-ON (p = 0.001) but not those with MOG-ON (p = 0.329) and was significantly different between the latter two groups (p = 0.005), while V1 was similar in patients with MOG-ON and AQP4-ON (p = 0.122), but was lower than controls in AQP4-ON (p = 0.002) but not those with MOG-ON (p = 0.210). The VA outcomes were better in MOG-ON than AQP4-ON, and linear regression analysis revealed that VA in MOG-ON and AQP4-ON was both predicted by the FA of OR (standard \u03b2 = -0.467 and -0.521, p = 0.036 and 0.034). Both patients of MOG-ON and AQP4-ON showed neuroaxonal damage in the form of pRNFL and GCC thinning but showed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.556, 0.817). Conclusion: The structural integrity of OR in patients with MOG-ON, which is different from the imaging manifestations of AQP4-ON, may be a reason for the better visual outcomes of patients with MOG-ON."

Herein, we report that a transfer RNA-derived RNA fragment, tRF-3001a, is significantly upregulated under diabetic conditions. tRF-3001a downregulation inhibits M\u00fcller cell activation, suppresses endothelial angiogenic effects, and protects against high-glucose-induced retinal ganglion cell injury in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, tRF-3001a downregulation alleviates retinal vascular dysfunction, inhibits retinal reactive gliosis, facilitates retinal ganglion cell survival, and preserves visual function and visually guided behaviors in STZ-induced diabetic mice and db/db diabetic mice. Mechanistically, tRF-3001a regulates neurovascular dysfunction in a microRNA-like mechanism by targeting GSK3B. Clinically, tRF-3001a is upregulated in aqueous humor (AH) samples of DR patients. tRF-3001a downregulation inhibits DR-induced human retinal vascular endothelial cell and M\u00fcller cell dysfunction in\u00a0vitro and DR-induced retinal neurovascular dysfunction in C57BL/6J mice. Thus, targeting tRF-3001a-mediated signaling is a promising strategy for the concurrent treatment of vasculopathy and neuropathy in diabetes mellitus."

Overexpressing tRF-1020 led to decreased endothelial cell viability, proliferation, migration, and tube formation and alleviated retinal vascular dysfunction as shown by decreased retinal acellular capillaries, vascular leakage, and inflammation. By contrast, tRF-1020 silencing displayed the opposite effects. tRF-1020 regulated endothelial angiogenic functions and retinal vascular dysfunction by targeting Wnt signalling. Moreover, the levels of tRF-1020 expression were reduced in aqueous humour and vitreous samples of the patients with diabetic retinopathy.

METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of BDB on DR using primary human retinal vascular endothelial cells and retinal tissue explants. The analysis involved assessing vascular integrity, expression of tight junction protein, hyperglycemia-induced permeability, and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis. The protective effect of BDB in maintaining the diabetic retinal neurovascular units was verified using type 1 diabetic mouse models. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of BDB on the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were examined. RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that BDB promoted vascular integrity, inhibited the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors, and alleviated hyperglycemia-induced permeability. BDB also protected RGC from hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis. In diabetic mice models, BDB treatment maintained the integrity of diabetic retinal neurovascular units and inhibited the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. CONCLUSION: BDB demonstrated a protective effect on DR by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of DR. Further research is warranted to validate its safety and efficacy for clinical application."

However, the involvement of tRFs in retinal microvascular diseases remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to reveal whether modulation of tRF-30 expression could attenuate pathological retinal neovascular diseases. Our findings demonstrate a significant upregulation of tRF-30 expression levels in both in vivo models of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and in vitro endothelial sprouting models. Conversely, inhibition of tRF-30 expression suppressed the formation of abnormal neovascularization in the retina in vivo, while reducing the proliferation and migration activity of retinal vascular endothelial cells in vitro. We also found that tRF-30 modulates retinal neovascularization through the tRF-30/TRIB3/signal transducer and activated transcription 3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we validated a significant upregulation of tRF-30 expression levels in the vitreous humor of DR patients, with high levels of both validity and specificity in diagnostic testing. Collectively, our findings highlight a pro-angiogenic role for tRF-30 in DR. Intervening in the tRF-30 signaling pathway may represent a promising prevention and treatment strategy for retinal angiogenesis."

M\u00fcller cells are key components of the retinal neurovascular unit and diabetes has a detrimental impact on these glial cells, triggering progressive neurovascular pathology of DR. Amongst many factors expressed by M\u00fcller cells, interleukin-33 (IL-33) has an established immunomodulatory role, and we investigated the role of endogenous IL-33 in DR. The expression of IL-33 in M\u00fcller cells increased during diabetes. Wild-type and Il33-/- mice developed equivalent levels of hyperglycaemia and weight loss following streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Electroretinogram a- and b-wave amplitudes, neuroretina thickness, and the numbers of cone photoreceptors and ganglion cells were significantly reduced in Il33-/- diabetic mice compared with those in wild-type counterparts. The Il33-/- diabetic retina also exhibited microglial activation, sustained gliosis, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins. Primary M\u00fcller cells from Il33-/- mice expressed significantly lower levels of neurotransmitter-related genes (Glul and Slc1a3) and neurotrophin genes (Cntf, Lif, Igf1 and Ngf) under high-glucose conditions. Our results suggest that deletion of IL-33 promotes inflammation and neurodegeneration in DR, and that this cytokine is critical for regulation of glutamate metabolism, neurotransmitter recycling and neurotrophin secretion by M\u00fcller cells."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Retinal M\u00fcller cells are known to produce inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines, which play important roles in diabetic retinopathy. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 has been shown to play a crucial role in retinal inflammation and neovascularisation. We sought to determine the role of M\u00fcller cell-derived HIF-1 in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and diabetic retinopathy using conditional Hif-1\u03b1 (also known as Hif1a) knockout (KO) mice. METHODS: Conditional Hif-1\u03b1 KO mice were generated by crossing mice expressing cyclisation recombinase (cre, also known as P1_gp003) in M\u00fcller cells with floxed Hif-1\u03b1 mice and used for OIR and streptozotocin-induced diabetes to induce retinal neovascularisation and inflammation, respectively. Abundance of HIF-1\u03b1 and pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors was measured by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Retinal neovascularisation was visualised by angiography and quantified by counting pre-retinal nuclei. Retinal inflammation was evaluated by leucostasis and vascular leakage. RESULTS: While the Hif-1\u03b1 KO mice showed significantly decreased HIF-1\u03b1 levels in the retina, they exhibited no apparent histological or visual functional abnormalities under normal conditions. Compared with wild-type counterparts, Hif-1\u03b1 KO mice with OIR demonstrated attenuated overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, reduced vascular leakage and alleviated neovascularisation in the retina. Under diabetes conditions, disruption of Hif-1\u03b1 in M\u00fcller cells attenuated the increases of retinal vascular leakage and adherent leucocytes, as well as the overproduction of VEGF and ICAM-1. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: M\u00fcller cell-derived HIF-1\u03b1 is a key mediator of retinal neovascularisation, vascular leakage and inflammation, the major pathological changes in diabetic retinopathy. M\u00fcller cell-derived HIF-1\u03b1 is therefore a promising therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in the working-age population, which is characterized by retinal neurodegeneration and vascular dysfunction. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in several biological processes and disease progression. Here we investigated the role of lncRNA AQP4-AS1 in retinal neurovascular dysfunction induced by diabetes. METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the AQP4-AS1 expression pattern upon diabetes mellitus-related stresses. Visual electrophysiology examination, TUNEL staining, Evans blue staining, retinal trypsin digestion and immunofluorescent staining were conducted to detect the role of AQP4-AS1 in retinal neurovascular dysfunction in vivo. MTT assays, TUNEL staining, PI/Calcein-AM staining, EdU incorporation assay transwell assay and tube formation were conducted to detect the role of AQP4-AS1 in retinal cells function in vitro. qRT-PCR, western blot and in vivo studies were conducted to reveal the mechanism of AQP4-AS1-mediated retinal neurovascular dysfunction. FINDINGS: AQP4-AS1 was significantly increased in the clinical samples of diabetic retinopathy patients, high glucose-treated M\u00fcller cells, and diabetic retinas of a murine model. AQP4-AS1 silencing in vivo alleviated retinal neurodegeneration and vascular dysfunction as shown by improved retinal capillary degeneration, decreased reactive gliosis, and reduced RGC loss. AQP4-AS1 directly regulated M\u00fcller cell function and indirectly affected endothelial cell and RGC function in vitro. Mechanistically, AQP4-AS1 regulated retinal neurovascular dysfunction through affecting AQP4 levels.

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most severe clinical manifestations of diabetes mellitus and a major cause of blindness. DR is principally a microvascular disease, although the pathogenesis also involves metabolic reactive intermediates which induce neuronal and glial activation resulting in disruption of the neurovascular unit and regulation of the microvasculature. However, the impact of neural/glial activation in DR remains controversial, notwithstanding our understanding as to when neural/glial activation occurs in the course of disease. The objective of this study was to determine a potential protective role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) using an established model of DR permissive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced vascular leakage. In vitro evaluation using primary retinal endothelial cells demonstrates that NPY promotes vascular integrity, demonstrated by maintained tight junction protein expression and reduced permeability in response to VEGF treatment. Furthermore, ex vivo assessment of retinal tissue explants shows that NPY can protect RGC from excitotoxic-induced apoptosis. In vivo clinical imaging and ex vivo tissue analysis in the diabetic model permitted assessment of NPY treatment in relation to neural and endothelial changes. The neuroprotective effects of NPY were confirmed by attenuating NMDA-induced retinal neural apoptosis and able to maintain inner retinal vascular integrity. These findings could have important clinical implications and offer novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment in the early stages of DR."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Interleukin (IL)-17A, a proinflammatory cytokine, has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases. However, it is unclear whether IL-17A is involved in diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most serious complications of autoimmune diabetes. This study aimed to demonstrate that IL-17A exacerbates DR by affecting retinal M\u00fcller cell function. METHODS: High glucose (HG)-treated rat M\u00fcller cell line (rMC-1) was exposed to IL-17A, anti-IL-17A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) or/and anti-IL-17 receptor (R)A-neutralizing mAb for 24 h. For in vivo study, DR was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ). DR model mice were treated with anti-IL-17A mAb or anti-IL-17RA mAb in the vitreous cavity. Mice that were prepared for retinal angiography were sacrificed two weeks after intravitreal injection, while the rest were sacrificed two days after intravitreal injection. RESULTS: IL-17A production and IL-17RA expression were increased in both HG-treated rMC-1 and DR retina. HG induced rMC-1 activation and dysfunction, as determined by the increased GFAP, VEGF and glutamate levels as well as the downregulated GS and EAAT1 expression. IL-17A exacerbated the HG-induced rMC-1 functional disorders, whereas either anti-IL-17A mAb or anti-IL-17RA mAb alleviated the HG-induced rMC-1 disorders. Intravitreal injections with anti-IL-17A mAb or anti-IL-17RA mAb in DR model mice reduced M\u00fcller cell dysfunction, vascular leukostasis, vascular leakage, tight junction protein downregulation and ganglion cell apoptosis in the retina. CONCLUSIONS: IL-17A aggravates DR-like pathology at least partly by impairing retinal M\u00fcller cell function. Blocking IL-17A is a potential therapeutic strategy for DR."

We have developed a novel oligonucleotide-based drug, CD5-2, that specifically increases expression of the key junctional protein involved in barrier integrity in endothelial cells, vascular-endothelial-specific cadherin (VE-cadherin). CD5-2 prevents the mRNA silencing by the pro-angiogenic microRNA, miR-27a. CD5-2 was evaluated in animal models of ocular neovascularisation and vascular leak to determine its potential efficacy for diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: CD5-2 was tested in three mouse models of retinal dysfunction: conditional M\u00fcller cell depletion, streptozotocin-induced diabetes and oxygen-induced retinopathy. Vascular permeability in the M\u00fcller cell-knockout model was assessed by fluorescein angiography. The Evans Blue leakage method was used to determine vascular permeability in streptozotocin- and oxygen-induced retinopathy models. The effects of CD5-2 on retinal neovascularisation, inter-endothelial junctions and pericyte coverage in streptozotocin- and oxygen-induced retinopathy models were determined by staining for isolectin-B4, VE-cadherin and neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2). Blockmir CD5-2 localisation in diseased retina was determined using fluorescent in situ hybridisation. The effects of CD5-2 on VE-cadherin expression and in diabetic retinopathy-associated pathways, such as the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and wingless/integrated (WNT) pathway, were confirmed using western blot of lysates from HUVECs, a mouse brain endothelial cell line and a VE-cadherin null mouse endothelial cell line. RESULTS: CD5-2 penetrated the vasculature of the eye in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Treatment of diseased mice with CD5-2 resulted in reduced vascular leak in all three animal models, enhanced expression of VE-cadherin in the microvessels of the eye and improved pericyte coverage of the retinal vasculature in streptozotocin-induced diabetic models and oxygen-induced retinopathy models. Further, CD5-2 reduced the activation of retinal microglial cells in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic model. The positive effects of CD5-2 seen in vivo were further confirmed in vitro by increased protein expression of VE-cadherin, SMAD2/3 activity, and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CD5-2 has therapeutic potential for individuals with vascular-leak-associated retinal diseases based on its ease of delivery and its ability to reverse vascular dysfunction and inflammatory aspects in three animal models of retinopathy."

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a hyperglycemia-induced ischemic disorder characterized by microvascular dysfunction and neovascularization. It is a leading cause of blindness in many countries, yet efficient drugs are limited now for prevention and treatment of DR. Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF), extract from brown algae, has been shown to possess multiple biological activities like anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-aggregation, which all could be beneficial for attenuating ischemia-induced tissue damages. Here, by comparing with calcium dobesilate, the potent antioxidant compound currently used for the treatment of DR, we investigated the protective effect of LMWF against DR in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-promoted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and cell proliferation in microvascular endothelial cells. One week after diabetes induction, the mice were administered with LMWF (50, 100 or 200\u00a0mg/kg/day) or calcium dobesilate (200\u00a0mg/kg/day) for four months, then the retinal pathological changes and neovascularization were detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining and fluorescein dextran angiography, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and RT-PCR were used to examine the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and VEGF in retina and endothelial cells. Here, we found that LMWF resembled calcium dobesilate, in alleviating retinal pathological change and hindering neovascularization due to diabetes in\u00a0vivo. The relative levels of VEGF expression and HIF-1\u03b1 induction were also less in retinas of LMWF- or calcium dobesilate-treated diabetic mice than those in retinas of control mice. Furthermore, high glucose-induced VEGF overexpression and cell proliferation in primary cultured vascular endothelial cells were also inhibited by LMWF in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, this study demonstrated that LMWF alleviates diabetic retinal neovascularization and damage likely through lowering HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expressions, providing a potential candidate drug for prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most serious complications of diabetes, has been associated with inflammatory processes. We have recently reported that interleukin (IL)-17A, a proinflammatory cytokine, is increased in the plasma of diabetic patients. Further investigation is required to clarify the role of IL-17A in DR. Ins2Akita (Akita) diabetic mice and high-glucose (HG)-treated primary M\u00fcller cells were used to mimic DR-like pathology. Diabetes induced retinal expression of IL-17A and IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) in M\u00fcller cells in contrast to ganglion cells. Further evidence demonstrated that retinal M\u00fcller cells cultured in vitro increased IL-17A and IL-17RA expression as well as IL-17A secretion in the HG condition. In both the HG-treated M\u00fcller cells and Akita mouse retina, the Act1/TRAF6/IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was activated. IL-17A further enhanced inflammatory signaling activation, whereas Act1 knockdown or IKK inhibition blocked the downstream signaling activation by IL-17A. HG- and diabetes-induced M\u00fcller cell activation and dysfunction, as determined by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor and glutamate levels and decreased glutamine synthetase and excitatory amino acid transporter-1 expression, were exacerbated by IL-17A; however, they were alleviated by Act1 knockdown or IKK inhibition. In addition, IL-17A intravitreal injection aggravated diabetes-induced retinal vascular leukostasis, vascular leakage and ganglion cell apoptosis, whereas Act1 silencing or anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody ameliorated the retinal vascular damage and neuronal cell apoptosis. These findings establish that IL-17A exacerbates DR-like pathology by the promotion of M\u00fcller cell functional impairment via Act1 signaling."

                "abstract": "Hyperglycemia-induced blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is an early and typical event of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Although chronic inflammation plays an important role in DR development, the concrete mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of microglia cells-triggered inflammatory response in hyperglycemia-induced BRB breakdown and the amelioration of galangin, a natural flavonoid. Galangin alleviated BRB breakdown in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. D-glucose (25 mM)-stimulated microglia BV2 cells induced BRB damage in vitro, but galangin reversed this injury. Galangin decreased the activation of microglia cells, ROS formation, the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2, the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) and early growth response (Egr1) protein, and the elevated expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 both in vitro and in vivo. ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 reduced ROS formation, the activation of NF\u03baB and Egr1, and the elevated TNF\u03b1 expression in D-glucose-stimulated BV2 cells. N-acetylcysteine, a well-known antioxidant, abrogated D-glucose-induced NF\u03baB and Egr1 activation in BV2 cells. Galangin also reversed the decreased expression of claudin1 and occludin, and the increased BRB injury and ROS formation in TNF\u03b1-treated human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and ARPE19 cells. Galangin induced the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in both HRECs and ARPE19 cells. Moreover, the galangin-provided attenuation on BRB breakdown was diminished in Nrf2 knockout diabetic mice. In conclusion, galangin alleviated DR by attenuating BRB damage via inhibiting microglia-triggered inflammation and further reversing TNF\u03b1-induced BRB dysfunction by abrogating oxidative stress injury via activating Nrf2."

Intraocular delivery of C-peptide has been shown to be beneficial against hyperglycemia-induced microvascular leakage in the retina of diabetes; however, the effect of C-peptide on diabetes-induced retinal neurodegeneration remains unknown. Moreover, extraocular C-peptide replacement therapy against DR to avoid various adverse effects caused by intravitreal injections has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that systemic C-peptide supplementation using osmotic pumps or biopolymer-conjugated C-peptide hydrogels ameliorates neurodegeneration by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor-induced pathological events, but not hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression, in the retinas of diabetic mice. C-peptide inhibited hyperglycemia-induced activation of macroglial and microglial cells, downregulation of glutamate aspartate transporter 1 expression, neuronal apoptosis, and histopathological changes by a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species generation in the retinas of diabetic mice, but transglutaminase 2, which is involved in retinal vascular leakage, is not associated with these pathological events. Overall, our findings suggest that systemic C-peptide supplementation alleviates hyperglycemia-induced retinal neurodegeneration by inhibiting a pathological mechanism, involving reactive oxygen species, but not transglutaminase 2, in diabetes."

                "abstract": "AIMS: Nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPKB) is capable of maintaining the cellular nucleotide triphosphate pools. It might therefore supply UTP for the formation of UDP-GlcNAc from glucose. As NDPKB contributes to vascular dysfunction, we speculate that NDPKB might play a role in microangiopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). Therefore, we investigated the impact of NDPKB on retinal vascular damage using NDPKB(-/-) mice during development of DR and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: Pericyte loss and acellular capillary (AC) formation were assessed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic NDPKB(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice. Expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) and protein N-acetylglucosamine modification (GlcNAcylation) were assessed by western blot and/or immunofluorescence in the diabetic retinas as well as in endothelial cells depleted of NDPKB by siRNA and stimulated with high glucose. RESULTS: Similar to diabetic WT retinas, non-diabetic NDPKB(-/-) retinas showed a significant decrease in pericyte coverage in comparison with non-diabetic WT retinas. Hyperglycemia further aggravates pericyte loss in diabetic NDPKB(-/-) retinas. AC formation was detected in the diabetic NDPKB(-/-) retinas. Similar to hyperglycemia, NDPKB deficiency induced Ang2 expression and protein GlcNAcylation that were not further altered in the diabetic retinas. In cultured endothelial cells, stimulation with high glucose and NDPKB depletion comparably increased Ang2 expression and protein GlcNAcylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify NDPKB as a protective factor in the retina, which controls Ang2 expression and the hexosamine pathway. NDPKB-deficient mice are a suitable model for studying mechanisms underlying diabetic retinal vascular damage."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the development of diabetic retinopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to play an important role in the apoptosis of retinal capillary cells. Diabetes activates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the retina and its capillary cells, and activated MMP-9 becomes proapoptotic. The objective of this study is to elucidate the plausible mechanism by which active MMP-9 contributes to the mitochondrial dysfunction in the retina. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using MMP-9 gene knockout (MMP-KO) mice, we investigated the effect of MMP-9 regulation on diabetes-induced increased retinal capillary cell apoptosis, development of retinopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction and ultrastructure, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. To understand how diabetes increases mitochondrial accumulation of MMP-9, interactions between MMP-9 and chaperone proteins (heat shock protein [Hsp] 70 and Hsp60) were evaluated. The results were confirmed in the retinal mitochondria from human donors with diabetic retinopathy, and in isolated retinal endothelial cells transfected with MMP-9 small interfering RNA (siRNA). RESULTS: Retinal microvasculature of MMP-KO mice, diabetic for \u223c7 months, did not show increased apoptosis and pathology characteristic of retinopathy. In the same MMP-KO diabetic mice, activation of MMP-9 and dysfunction of the mitochondria were prevented, and electron microscopy of the retinal microvasculature region revealed normal mitochondrial matrix and packed lamellar cristae. Damage to mtDNA was protected, and the binding of MMP-9 with Hsp70 or Hsp60 was also normal. As in the retina from wild-type diabetic mice, activation of mitochondrial MMP-9 and alterations in the binding of MMP-9 with chaperone proteins were also observed in the retina from donors with diabetic retinopathy. In endothelial cells transfected with MMP-9 siRNA, high glucose-induced damage to the mitochondria and the chaperone machinery was ameliorated. CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of activated MMP-9 prevents retinal capillary cells from undergoing apoptosis by protecting mitochondrial ultrastructure and function and preventing mtDNA damage. Thus, MMP-9 inhibitors could have potential therapeutic value in preventing the development of diabetic retinopathy by preventing the continuation of the vicious cycle of mitochondrial damage."

This study aims to elucidate the protection of erianin, a natural compound isolated from Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl, against DR development. Erianin alleviated BRB breakdown and rescued the reduced claudin1 and occludin expression in retinas from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Erianin reduced microglial activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation, and the elevated TNF-\u03b1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 abrogated NF-\u03baB activation in d-glucose-treated BV2 cells. Erianin reduced cellular glucose uptake, and molecular docking analysis indicated the potential interaction of erianin with glucose transporter (GLUT)1. GLUT1 inhibitor (STF31) reduced the activation of the ERK1/2-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Coculture with d-glucose-stimulated microglial BV2 cells and with TNF-\u03b1 stimulation both induced inner BRB and outer BRB damage in human retinal endothelial cells and APRE19 cells, but erianin improved all these damages. In summary, erianin attenuated BRB breakdown during DR development by inhibiting microglia-triggered retinal inflammation via reducing cellular glucose uptake and abrogating the subsequent activation of the downstream ERK1/2-NF-\u03baB pathway.

To explore the biological functions and mechanism of GEN in diabetic retinopathy (DR), we constructed the in vitro and in vivo model of DR by using primary cultured mouse retinal M\u00fcller cells and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. We found that GEN inhibited ROS accumulation, NF-\u03baB activation, M\u00fcller cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine secretion both in vitro and in vivo, which is probably mediated through the Nrf2 pathway. Exendin (9-39) (EX-9), an antagonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), abolished the protective effect of GEN on high glucose- (HG-) induced M\u00fcller cells. Additionally, GEN decreased hyperglycemia-induced damage to M\u00fcller cells and blood-retinal barrier in the retinas of mice with DR. We demonstrated that GEN was capable of protecting M\u00fcller cells and mice from HG-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, which is mostly dependent on the Nrf2 signaling pathway through GLP-1R. GEN may be an effective approach for the treatment of DR."

                "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) develops in a significant proportion of patients with chronic diabetes, characterized by retinal macular edema and abnormal retinal vessel outgrowth leading to vision loss. Chrysin, a naturally-occurring flavonoid found in herb and honeycomb, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. This study sought to determine the protective effects of chrysin on retinal neovascularization with abnormal vessels and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown in 33 mM glucose-exposed human retinal endothelial cells and in db/db mouse eyes. High glucose caused retinal endothelial apoptotic injury, which was inhibited by submicromolar chrysin. This compound diminished the enhanced induction of HIF-1\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in high glucose-exposed retinal endothelial cells. Consistently, oral administration of 10 mg/kg chrysin reduced the induction of these proteins in db/db mouse eye tissues. In addition, chrysin restored the decrement of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 junction proteins and PECAM-1 in hyperglycemia-stimulated retinal endothelial cells and diabetic mouse retina, possibly maintaining tight cell-cell interactions of endothelial cells and pericytes. Anti-apoptotic chrysin reduced the up-regulation of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 crucial to retinal capillary occlusion and BRB permeability. Furthermore, orally treating chrysin inhibited acellular capillary formation, neovascularization, and vascular leakage observed in diabetic retinas. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, that chrysin had a capability to encumber diabetes-associated retinal neovascularization with microvascular abnormalities and BRB breakdown."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown and vascular leakage is the leading cause of blindness of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation are primary pathogenic factors of this severe DR complication. An effective interventional modality against the pathogenic factors during early DR is needed to curb BRB breakdown and vascular leakage. This study sought to examine the protective effects of \u03b1-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) on early diabetic retina against vascular hyperpermeability, electrophysiological dysfunction, and morphological deterioration in a rat model of diabetes and probe the mechanisms underlying the \u03b1-MSH's anti-hyperpermeability in both rodent retinas and simian retinal vascular endothelial cells (RF6A). METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were injected through tail vein with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. The rats were intravitreally injected with \u03b1-MSH or saline at Week 1 and 3 after hyperglycemia. In another 2 weeks, Evans blue assay, transmission electron microscopy, electroretinogram (ERG), and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were performed to examine the protective effects of \u03b1-MSH in diabetic retinas. The expression of pro-inflammatory factors and tight junction at mRNA and protein levels in retinas was analyzed. Finally, the \u03b1-MSH's anti-hyperpermeability was confirmed in a high glucose (HG)-treated RF6A cell monolayer transwell culture by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-Dextran assay. Universal or specific melanocortin receptor (MCR) blockers were also employed to elucidate the MCR subtype mediating \u03b1-MSH's protection. RESULTS: Evans blue assay showed that BRB breakdown and vascular leakage was detected, and rescued by \u03b1-MSH both qualitatively and quantitatively in early diabetic retinas; electron microscopy revealed substantially improved retinal and choroidal vessel ultrastructures in \u03b1-MSH-treated diabetic retinas; scotopic ERG suggested partial rescue of functional defects by \u03b1-MSH in diabetic retinas; and H&E staining revealed significantly increased thickness of all layers in \u03b1-MSH-treated diabetic retinas. Mechanistically, \u03b1-MSH corrected aberrant transcript and protein expression of pro-inflammatory factor and tight junction genes in the diseased retinas; moreover, it prevented abnormal changes in TEER and permeability in HG-stimulated RF6A cells, and this anti-hyperpermeability was abolished by a universal MCR blocker or an antagonist specific to MC4R. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed previously undescribed protective effects of \u03b1-MSH on inhibiting BRB breakdown and vascular leakage, improving electrophysiological functions and morphology in early diabetic retinas, which may be due to its down-regulating pro-inflammatory factors and augmenting tight junctions. \u03b1-MSH acts predominantly on MC4R to antagonize hyperpermeability in retinal microvessel endothelial cells."

            "abstract": "Renal tubular damage plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and one of the main pathological process associated with DKD in diabetic mice is the ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Several researches suggested that empagliflozin may treat renal injury, but its effects on diabetic-related ferroptosis and underlying mechanisms were not fully elucidated. In this study, the influence of empagliflozin on renal injury was evaluated in vivo and in vitro in a mouse model and in high-glucose (HG) or Erastin-stimulated renal HK-2\u00a0cell line, respectively. Ferroptosis-related markers were assessed, including GSH, labile iron levels, and ferroptosis regulators by Western blot, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the fluorescence intensity of BODIPY probe indicated the level of lipid peroxidation. It was demonstrated that solute carrier family 7, member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were less expressed in renal biopsy samples from patients affected by DKD than in those from non-diabetic renal disease patients (NDRD), proving the ferroptosis of tubular epithelial cells in case of DKD. Furthermore, empagliflozin markedly decreased the ferroptosis impairment in DKD mice, as well as in HG model of HK-2\u00a0cells. Our investigations showed the ability of empagliflozin to suppress ferroptosis was partially countered by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, which led to a reduction of the nuclear translocation of the antioxidant transcription factor NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and downregulation of target genes such as GPX4, ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), and SLC7A11, while AMPK agonists were responsible for the enhancement of the protective effects of empagliflozin. Taken together, our findings showed that empagliflozin may prevent the development of ferroptosis by promoting the AMPK-mediated NRF2 activation pathway, providing important insights for possible novel treatment approaches for DKD."

                "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is thought to be the major cause of end-stage renal disease. Due to its complicated pathogenesis and the low efficacy of DN treatment, a deep understanding of new etiological factors may be useful. Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic form of cell death, is characterized by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides to lethal levels. Ferroptosis-triggered renal tubular injury is reported to participate in the development of DN, and blocking ferroptosis might be an effective strategy to prevent the development of DN. Quercetin (QCT), a natural flavonoid that is present in a variety of fruits and vegetables, has been reported to ameliorate DN. However, its underlying nephroprotective mechanism is unclear. Herein, we explored the antiferroptosic effect of QCT and verified its nephroprotective effect using DN mice and high glucose (HG)-incubated renal tubular epithelial cell models. We found HG-induced abnormal activation of ferroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells, and QCT treatment inhibited ferroptosis by downregulating the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFR-1) and upregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH-1), and the cystine/glutamate reverse antiporter solute carrier family 7 member (SLC7A11) in DN mice and HG-incubated HK-2 cells. Subsequently, both in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that QCT activated the NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) signaling pathway by increasing the levels of Nrf2 and HO-1. Therefore, this study supports that QCT inhibits the ferroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells by regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, providing a novel insight into the protective mechanism of QCT in DN treatment."

                "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is now considered the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. In diabetes, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron overload are important determinants that promote the occurrence of DN. However, the underlying mechanism of how they cause diabetic kidney damage remains unclear. Ferroptosis, characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, provided us with a new idea to explore the progression of DN. Iron overload, reduced antioxidant capability, massive ROS and lipid peroxidation were detected in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced DBA/2J diabetic mice and high-glucose cultured human renal proximal tubular (HK-2) cells, which were the symbolic changes of ferroptosis. Furthermore, the characteristic mitochondrial morphological changes of ferroptosis were observed in high glucose cultured cells. Additional treatment of Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) in DN models significantly rescued these changes and alleviated the renal pathological injuries in diabetic mice. Besides, the decreased NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was observed in DN models. The specific knockdown of Nrf2 increased the sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis in the high glucose condition. In Nrf2 knockdown cells, up-regulating Nrf2 by treating with fenofibrate improved the situation of ferroptosis, which was verified in RSL-3 induced cells. Moreover, the ferroptosis-related changes were inhibited by increasing Nrf2 in fenofibrate treated diabetic mice, which delayed the progression of DN. Collectively, we demonstrated that ferroptosis was involved in the development of DN, and up-regulating Nrf2 by treating with fenofibrate inhibited diabetes-related ferroptosis, delaying the progression of DN. Our research revealed the development mechanism of DN from a new perspective, and provide a new approach delaying the progression of DN."

                "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression can be predicted by abnormalities in the tubulointerstitial lining, and their treatment may be useful for preventing the disease. DKD is a progressive disease that contributes to renal tubular cell death, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a novel term linked to lipid hydroperoxidation, and it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DKD. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), an enzyme of the proximal tubule, causes cellular redox damage in DKD. It remains unknown whether COX2 exacerbates tubular damage by accelerating ferroptosis in the kidneys of diabetic mice. HK-2 cells cultured in high glucose exhibited ferroptosis, which was inhibited by ferroptosis inhibitors. Additionally, alterations in the sensors of ferroptosis metabolism, such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity, lipid hydroperoxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and changes in mitochondrial morphology, were observed in high glucose-cultured HK-2 cells. Diabetic mice manifested tubular injury and deranged renal physiological indices, which were mitigated by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Importantly, these perturbations were ameliorated by downregulating COX2. In addition, the increased COX2 was observed to be elevated in the daibetic kindney. To explore the relevance of COX2 to ferroptosis, HK-2 cells that knocked down from COX2 exhibited decreased ferroptosis sensitivity under high glucose conditions. In RSL-3-treated HK-2 cells, ferroptosis was improved by downregulating COX2 by treatment with aspirin, which was confirmed in high glucose-cultured HK-2 cells. Furthermore, the ferroptosis changes were also suppressed by decreasing COX2 in diabetic mice treated with aspirin, which retarded DKD progression. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ferroptosis in renal tubular cells contributes to DKD development and that diabetes-related ferroptosis was inhibited through the downregulation of COX2 by aspirin, thus retarding the progression of DKD. Our findings support a renoprotective mechanism by which aspirin inhibits COX2 activation, identify COX2 as a potential target of ferroptosis, and establish that ferroptosis in renal tubular cells is an integral process in the pathogenesis of DKD regulated by COX2 expression profiles."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The limitations of modern medicine in mitigating the pathological process of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) necessitate novel, precise, and effective prevention and treatment methods. Huangqi, the root of Astragalus membranaceus Fisch. ex Bunge has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for various kidney ailments. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), the primary pharmacologically active compound in A. membranaceus, is involved in lipid metabolism regulation; however, its potential in ameliorating renal damage in DKD remains unexplored. AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the specific mechanism by which AS-IV moderates DKD progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A murine model of DKD and high glucose-induced HK-2\u00a0cells were treated with AS-IV. Furthermore, multiomics analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of AS-IV in DKD, which was validated using molecular biological methods. RESULTS: AS-IV regulated glucose and lipid metabolism in DKD, thereby mitigating lipid deposition in the kidneys. Proteomic analysis identified 12 proteins associated with lipid metabolism regulated by AS-IV in the DKD renal tissue. Additionally, lipid metabolomic analysis revealed that AS-IV upregulated and downregulated 4 beneficial and 79 harmful lipid metabolites, respectively. Multiomics analysis further indicated a positive correlation between the top-ranked differential protein heme oxygenase (HMOX)1 and the levels of various harmful lipid metabolites and a negative correlation with the levels of beneficial lipid metabolites. Furthermore, enrichment of both ferroptosis and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathways during the AS-IV treatment of DKD was observed using proteomic analysis. Validation results showed that AS-IV effectively reduced ferroptosis in DKD-affected renal tubular epithelial cells by inhibiting HIF-1\u03b1/HMOX1 pathway activity, upregulating glutathione peroxidase-4 and ferritin heavy chain-1 expression, and downregulating acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member-4 and transferrin receptor-1 expression. Our findings demonstrate the potential of AS-IV in mitigating DKD pathology by downregulating the HIF-1\u03b1/HMOX1 signaling pathway, thereby averting ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: AS-IV is a promising treatment strategy for DKD via the inhibition of ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. The findings of this study may help facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

                "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) poses a threat to people's health. The current treatments only provide partial relief of symptoms. Therefore, seeking a promising therapeutic medication for the prevention and control on DKD will benefit patients. Recently, a novel iron-dependent and non-apoptotic regulated mode of cell death, termed as ferroptosis, is expected to offer us a novel insight into the mechanism of DKD. We conducted experiments to investigate the role of ferroptosis in the development of DKD. Iron accumulation, weakened antioxidant capacity and ROS overproduction were observed in the renal tissues of STZ-induced diabetic rats. A persistent high glucose condition contributed to down regulated levels of Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 (SLC7A11) which marked the occurrence of ferroptosis. Treatment of Emodin in DKD models could significantly attenuated these changes and reduced renal injury. Besides, NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an important antioxidant regulator, was inhibited in both in vivo and in vitro assay, which contributes to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation that further promoted the expression of ferroptosis related protein. These unwanted effects were offset by the intervention of Emodin. The specific Nrf2 knock out enhanced cell's sensitivity to ferroptosis by being exposed to high glucose culture, which was improved by treatment of Emodin via restoring activity of Nrf2. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that Emodin exerted renal protection against DKD via inhibiting ferroptosis and restoring Nrf2 mediated antioxidant capacity, which could be employed as a novel therapeutic medication against DKD."

Nrf2 plays an important role in regulating lipid peroxidation and is closely related to ferroptosis. Umbelliferone has antioxidant, anti-glycation and protective effects on diabetic mice. However, the potential mechanisms and underlying effects of these effects in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remain to be investigated. METHODS: 10-week-old male C57BLKS/J db/db, C57BLKS/J db/m mice and HK-2\u00a0cells cultured with high glucose were used as experimental objects in this study. ROS levels, GSH, MDA and iron content were detected. RESULTS: We found that Umbelliferone can significantly improve the renal pathological damage and ROS accumulation of db/db mice, and inhibit ferroptosis, such as the down-regulation of ACSL4 and the up-regulation of GPX4. Meanwhile, Nrf2 and HO-1 expression were up-regulated. We demonstrated that knockdown of Nrf2 blocked the inhibitory effect of Umbelliferone on ferroptosis in renal tubule cells induced by high glucose. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Umbelliferone has a protective effect on DN, possibly by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thus attenuating the level of high glucose-induced ferroptosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Ferroptosis is an atypical form of iron-dependent, modulated cell death that has been shown to occur in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Leonurine (LEO) is a single active ingredient extracted from Leonurus japonicus Houtt. It has various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. However, whether LEO affects ferroptosis in DN has yet to be investigated. METHODS: An animal model of DN was established by subjecting C57/BL6 mice to a high-fat diet (HFD) while being induced with Streptozotocin (STZ). A cellular model of DN was established by exposing HUVECs to a high glucose (HG) concentration of 30 mM. RESULTS: LEO was found to improve DN and to attenuate the degree of glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy in the mouse model. Additionally, it markedly decreased the levels of ferroptosis markers. Molecular analyses revealed that LEO inhibited HG-induced oxidative stress in HUVECs, thereby decreasing endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. Furthermore, LEO was found to reduce ferroptosis and reverse EC dysfunction by increasing the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The suppression of Nrf2 in HG-induced HUVECs inhibited LEO-GPX4 axis-mediated ferroptosis and increased EC dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: LEO exerts anti-DN effects both in vivo and in vitro by suppressing GPX4-mediated EC ferroptosis. Mechanistically, LEO appears to induce Nrf2-mediated GPX4 expression to inhibit ferroptosis, thereby reducing EC dysfunction. This study provides a new perspective on the treatment of diseases using natural medicines. It involves a novel form of cell death that could potentially lead to better treatment of DN."

Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), the primary bioactive compound, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties; however, its renoprotective mechanism in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains unclear. The study aimed to investigate the protective effects of AS-IV on DKD revealing the underlying mechanisms. We established an early diabetic rat model by feeding a high-fat diet and administering low-dose streptozotocin. Twelve weeks post-treatment, renal function was evaluated using functional assays, histological analyses, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. HK-2 cells exposed to high glucose conditions were used to examine the effect of AS-IV on oxidative stress, iron levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid peroxidation. Network pharmacology, proteomics, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation techniques were employed to elucidate the role of AS-IV in DKD. The results revealed that AS-IV effectively enhanced renal function and mitigated disease pathology, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis markers in DKD rats. In HK-2 cells, AS-IV lowered the levels of lipid peroxides, Fe2+, and glutathione, indicating the repair of ferroptosis-related mitochondrial damage. AS-IV reduced mitochondrial ROS while enhancing mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, indicating its role in combating mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, in silico analyses revealed that AS-IV interacts with HMOX1, FTH1, and TFR1 proteins, supporting its efficacy in alleviating renal injury by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis. AS-IV may play a renoprotective role by regulating mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibiting. HMOX1/FTH1/TFR1-induced ferroptosis. Accordingly, AS-IV could be developed for the clinical treatment of DKD-related renal injury."

Accumulative studies have indicated diabetic nephropathy (DN) as an inflammatory disorder, which involved immune modulation both in the occurrence and progression of the disease. In addition, DN is also considered as the major threatening complication of Diabetes mellitus (DM). However, other forms of programmed cell death, such as autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis, have been reported to be associated with DN, while there are no effective drugs to alleviate the damage of DN. In this study, we explored whether ferroptosis was involved in the progression of DN both in vivo and in vitro. We first established DN models using streptozotocin (STZ) and db/db mice. Results showed significant changes of ferroptosis associated markers, like increased expression levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and decreased expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in DN mice. Also lipid peroxidation products and iron content were increased in DN mice. Next, in vitro, ferroptosis inducer erastin or RSL3 could induce renal tubular cell death, while iron and high ACSL4 levels sensitised ferroptosis. Finally, ACSL4 inhibitor rosiglitazone (Rosi) was used in the development of DN, which improved survival rate and kidney function, reduced lipid peroxidation product MDA and iron content. In summary, we first found ferroptosis was involved in DN and ferroptosis might be as a future direction in the treatment of DN."

Pachymic acid\u00a0(PA), a lanostane\u2011type triterpenoid from Poria cocos, has been reported to be protective against AKI. However, the protective mechanism of PA in AKI is not yet fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of PA on ferroptosis in renal ischemia reperfusion injury in\u00a0vivo. A total of 30\u00a0mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5, 10\u00a0and 20\u00a0mg/kg PA for 3\u00a0days. A bilateral renal pedicle clip was used for 40\u00a0min to induce renal ischemia\u2011reperfusion injury and establish the model. The results demonstrated that treatment with PA decreased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and ameliorated renal pathological damage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed no characteristic changes in ferroptosis in the mitochondria of the renal tissue in the high\u2011dose PA\u00a0group, and only mild edema. Furthermore, treatment with PA increased glutathione expression, and decreased the expression levels of malondialdehyde and cyclooxygenase\u00a02. Treatment with PA enhanced the protein and mRNA expression levels of the ferroptosis related proteins, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), solute carrier family\u00a07 (cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system) member\u00a011 (SLC7A11) and heme oxygenase\u00a01 (HO\u20111) in the kidney, and increased the expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid derived\u00a02 like\u00a02 (NRF2) signaling pathway members. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that PA has a protective effect on ischemia\u2011reperfusion induced acute kidney injury in mice, which may be associated with the inhibition of ferroptosis in the kidneys through direct or indirect activation of NRF2, and upregulation of the expression of the downstream ferroptosis related proteins, GPX4, SLC7A11 and HO\u20111."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Erastin was used to stimulate HT22\u00a0cells to form ferroptosis model to evaluate the anti-ferroptosis effect of WEM by cell counting kit-8 and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) tests. The malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) kits are used for detection of MDA and GSH levels, and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and C11 BODIPY 581/591 fluorescence probe are used for evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxide (LOOH) levels.

In addition, the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 was applied to verify whether WEM prevents erastin-induced ferroptosis by activating the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. RESULTS: After WEM treatment, erastin-induced HT22\u00a0cell survival was significantly elevated, the accumulation of intracellular MDA, ROS, and LOOH were significantly reduced, the level of GSH and expressions of ferroptosis inhibitors GPX4 and SLC7A11 were significantly increased, and iron metabolism-related proteins TFRC, FPN1, and FTH1 were regulated. These effects of WEM are implemented by activating the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that WEM could perform neuroprotective effects by alleviating ferroptosis, verified that WEM treatment of AD can be mediated by the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, and provided theoretical support for the application of WEM in the treatment of AD."

The level of intracellular free iron, the expression of the ferroptosis-related proteins acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and the levels of the lipid peroxidation markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined. RESULTS: We observed the inhibitory effect of C3G on ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo, which was characterized by the reversion of excessive intracellular free iron accumulation, a decrease in 4-HNE, lipid ROS, MDA levels and ACSL4 expression, and an increase in GPX4 expression and glutathione (GSH) levels. Notably, the inhibition of AMPK by CC significantly abrogated the nephroprotective effect of C3G on I/R-AKI models in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insight into the nephroprotective effect of C3G on acute I/R-AKI by inhibiting ferroptosis by activating the AMPK pathway."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) involves a variety of pathological processes, and ferroptosis plays a vital role in CKD progression. Targeting ferroptosis is a promising strategy for the treatment of CKD. However, inhibitors of ferroptosis have not been used in the clinical treatment of CKD. Vitexin is a natural flavonoid with many biological activities and protective effects against various diseases. However, whether vitexin can prevent the progression of CKD is not known. METHODS: In vivo, the effect of vitexin on CKD was evaluated by using mouse models of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and unilateral ischemia-reperfusion (UIR). Western blotting, Sirius red staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze renal tubular injury, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation in the kidneys of UUO and UIR mice. In vitro, CCK8 assays and lipid peroxidation assays were performed to analyze cell viability and lipid peroxidation in human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2 cells) induced by erastin. The activation of renal fibroblasts (NRK-49\u00a0F cells) was also analyzed. Additionally, an in-silico protein-drug docking model and coimmunoprecipitation were performed to determine the direct substrate of vitexin. RESULTS: In vivo, vitexin treatment significantly ameliorated renal tubular injury, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation in the kidneys of UUO and UIR mice. Additionally, our results showed that vitexin significantly attenuated UUO- and UIR-induced ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein levels and inhibiting lipid peroxidation in mouse kidneys. In vitro, treatment with vitexin inhibited erastin-induced ferroptosis in HK2 cells. Moreover, vitexin inhibited the expression of collagen I and \u03b1-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin) in NRK-49\u00a0F cells induced by the supernatant of erastin-treated HK2 cells. Mechanistically, our results suggested that vitexin could activate the NRF2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway by inhibiting the KEAP1- and ubiquitination-mediated degradation of NRF2, thereby increasing the expression of GPX4, and further inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Additionally, knockout of NRF2 greatly inhibited the antiferroptotic effects of vitexin. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that vitexin can protect against renal tubular epithelial cell ferroptosis in CKD by activating the KEAP1/NRF2/HO-1 pathway and is a promising drug to treat CKD."

                "abstract": "Aims: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) showed excellent renoprotective effects; however, the underlying mechanism remains not fully understood. Previous studies have revealed the importance of ferroptosis, which is closely related to oxidative stress, in the progression of DKD. In the current study, we hypothesized that SGLT2i could relieve ferroptosis and thereby alleviate renal injury in DKD due to their antioxidative stress effects. Results: Typical changes of ferroptosis including massive lipid peroxidation, compromised antioxidant capability, and iron overload were found in db/db mice and high glucose/high fat (HG/HF)-treated HK-2 cells. Furthermore, increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) was observed in db/db mice and HG/HF-treated HK-2 cells as well. Dapagliflozin treatment significantly ameliorated the ferroptosis-related changes via attenuating overactivation of the HIF1\u03b1/HO1 axis in vivo and in vitro. Besides, downregulation of the HIF1\u03b1/HO1 axis alleviated ferroptosis, while overexpression of HIF1\u03b1 and HO1 aggravated ferroptosis induced by HG/HF in HK-2 cells. Innovation and Conclusion: This study revealed that SGLT2i played a renoprotective role in DKD, at least in part, through alleviating HIF1\u03b1/HO1-mediated ferroptosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Excessive mitochondrial fission was observed in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) plays an important role in mitochondrial fission by dephosphorylating the dynamin-related protein 1 at Ser637 (DRP1S637). Whether PGAM5 participates in the mitochondrial fission in diabetic renal tubular injury is unknown. Clinical trials have observed encouraging effect of Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on DKD though the underling mechanisms remain unclear. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used KK-Ay mice as diabetic model and Empagliflozin (Empa) were administrated by oral gavage. The mitochondrial fission and the expressions of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), specificityprotein1 (SP1), PGAM5 and DRP1S637 were tested. We also examined these changes in HK2 cells that cultured in normal glucose (NG), high glucose (HG) and high glucose+Empa (HG\u202f+\u202fEmpa) environment. Then we verified our deduction using AMPK activator (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboximide Riboside, AICAR), inhibitor (Compound C), si-SP1 and si-PGAM5. Lastly, we testified the interaction between SP1 and the PGAM5promotor by CHIP assay. KEY RESULTS: The mitochondrial fission and the expression of SP1, PGAM5 increased and the expression of p-AMPK, DRP1S637 decreased in diabetic or HG environment. These changes were all reversed in Empa or AICAR treated groups. These reversal effects of Empa could be diminished by Compound C. Either si-SP1 or si-PGAM5 could alleviate the mitochondrial fission without affection on AMPK phosphorylation. Finally, the CHIP assay confirmed the interaction between SP1 and the PGAM5 promotor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The PGAM5 aggravated the development of diabetic renal tubular injury and the Empa could improve the DKD by alleviating mitochondrial fission via AMPK/SP1/PGAM5 pathway."

                "abstract": "Kidney tubules are mostly responsible for pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. Actively reabsorption of iron, high rate of lipid metabolism and exposure to concentrated redox-active compounds constructed the three main pillars of ferroptosis in tubular cells. However, limited evidence has indicated that ferroptosis is indispensable for diabetic tubular injury. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) processed strong benefits on kidney outcomes in people with diabetes. Moreover, GLP-1RA may have additive effects by improving dysmetabolism besides glucose control and weight loss. Therefore, the present study aimed at exploring the benefits of exendin-4, a high affinity GLP-1RA on kidney tubular dysregulation in diabetes and the possible mechanisms involved, with focus on ferroptosis and adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mitochondrial lipid metabolism pathway. Our data revealed that exendin-4 treatment markedly improved kidney structure and function by reducing iron overload, oxidative stress, and ACSL4-driven lipid peroxidation taken place in diabetic kidney tubules, along with reduced GPX4 expression and GSH content. AMPK signaling was identified as the downstream target of exendin-4, and enhancement of AMPK triggered the transmit of its downstream signal to activate fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and suppress lipid synthesis and glycolysis, and ultimately alleviated toxic lipid accumulation and ferroptosis. Further study suggested that exendin-4 was taken up by tubular cells via macropinocytosis. The protective effect of exendin-4 on tubular ferroptosis was abolished by macropinocytosis blockade. Taken together, present work demonstrated the beneficial effects of GLP-1RA treatment on kidney tubular protection in diabetes by suppressing ferroptosis through enhancing AMPK-fatty acid metabolic signaling via macropinocytosis."

                "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is often featured with redox dyshomeostatis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is the hub for DKD development. However, the mechanism by which PDK4 mediates DKD is poorly understood. The current work aimed to elucidate the relationship between PDK4 and DKD from the perspective of redox manipulation. Oxidative stress was observed in the human proximal tubular cell line (HK-2 cells) treated with a high concentration of glucose and palmitic acid (HGL). The mechanistic study showed that PDK4 could upregulate Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in HGL-treated HK-2 cells through the suppression of autophagy, resulting in the depletion of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the master regulator of redox homeostasis. At the cellular level, pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of PDK4 could boost Nrf2, followed by the increase of a plethora of antioxidant enzymes and ferroptosis-suppression enzymes. Meanwhile, the inhibition or knockdown of PDK4 remodeled iron metabolism, further mitigating oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The same trend was observed in the DKD mice model. The current work highlighted the role of PDK4 in the development of DKD and suggested that PDK4 might be a promising target for the management of DKD."

Here, we investigated the role of heme-binding protein 1 (Hebp1) in erectile function using a mouse model of bilateral CNI, which is known to promote angiogenesis and improve erection in diabetic mice. We found a potent neurovascular regenerative effect of Hebp1 in CNI mice, demonstrating that exogenously delivered Hebp1 improved erectile function by promoting the survival of cavernous endothelial-mural cells and neurons. We further found that endogenous Hebp1 delivered by mouse cavernous pericyte (MCP)-derived extracellular vesicles promoted neurovascular regeneration in CNI mice. Moreover, Hebp1 achieved these effects by reducing vascular permeability through regulation of claudin family proteins. Our findings provide new insights into Hebp1 as a neurovascular regeneration factor and demonstrate its potential therapeutic application to various peripheral nerve injuries."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicle (EV)-mimetic nanovesicles (NVs) from embryonic stem cells have been observed to stimulate neurovascular regeneration in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse. Pericytes play important roles in maintaining penile erection, yet no previous studies have explored the effects of pericyte-derived NVs (PC-NVs) in neurovascular regeneration in the context of erectile dysfunction. AIM: To investigate the potential effect of PC-NVs in neurovascular regeneration. METHODS: PC-NVs were isolated from mouse cavernous pericytes, and neurovascular regeneration was evaluated in an in\u00a0vitro study. Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice were used to prepare cavernous nerve injury model. Erectile function evaluation, histologic examination of the penis, and Western blots were assessed 2\u00a0weeks after model creation and PC-NVs treatment. OUTCOMES: The main outcomes of this study are PC-NVs characterization, intracavernous pressure, neurovascular regeneration in the penis, and in\u00a0vitro functional evaluation. RESULTS: The PC-NVs were extracted and characterized by cryotransmission electron microscopy and EV-positive (Alix, TSG101, CD81) and EV-negative (GM130) markers. In the in\u00a0vivo studies, PC-NVs successfully improved erectile function in cavernous nerve injury mice (\u223c82% of control values). Immunofluorescence staining showed significant increases in pericytes, endothelial cell, and neuronal contents. In the in\u00a0vitro studies, PC-NVs significantly increased mouse cavernous endothelial cells tube formation, Schwann cell migration, and dorsal root ganglion and major pelvic ganglion neurite sprouting. Finally, Western blot analysis revealed that PC-NVs upregulated cell survival signaling (Akt and eNOS) and induced the expression of neurotrophic factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and nerve growth factor). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: PC-NVs may be used as a strategy to treat erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or in men with neurovascular diseases. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: We evaluated the effect of PC-NVs in\u00a0vitro and in a mouse nerve injury model, cavernous nerve injury. Additional studies are necessary to determine the detailed mechanisms of neurovascular improvement. Further study is needed to test whether PC-NVs are also effective when given weeks or months after nerve injury. CONCLUSION: PC-NVs significantly improved erectile function by enhancing neurovascular regeneration. Local treatment with PC-NVs may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurovascular diseases. Yin GN, Park S-H, Ock J, et\u00a0al.

                "abstract": "Penile erection is a neurovascular event and neurologic or vascular disturbances are major causes of erectile dysfunction (ED). Radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer not only induces cavernous nerve injury (CNI) but also results in cavernous angiopathy, which is responsible for poor responsiveness to oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Dickkopf2 (DKK2) is known as a Wnt signaling antagonist and is reported to promote mature and stable blood vessel formation. Here, we demonstrated in CNI mice that overexpression of DKK2 by administering DKK2 protein or by using DKK2-Tg mice successfully restored erectile function: this recovery was accompanied by enhanced neural regeneration through the secretion of neurotrophic factors, and restoration of cavernous endothelial cell and pericyte content. DKK2 protein also promoted neurite outgrowth in an ex vivo major pelvic ganglion culture experiment and enhanced tube formation in primary cultured mouse cavernous endothelial cells and pericytes co-culture system in vitro. In light of critical role of neuropathy and angiopathy in the pathogenesis of radical prostatectomy-induced ED, reprogramming of damaged erectile tissue toward neurovascular repair by use of a DKK2 therapeutic protein may represent viable treatment option for this condition."

Men with diabetic ED do not respond well to oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors owing to neurovascular dysfunction. Pericyte-derived extracellular vesicle-mimetic nanovesicles (PC-NVs) are known to promote nerve regeneration in a mouse model of cavernous nerve injury. Here, we report that administration of PC-NVs effectively promoted penile angiogenesis and neural regeneration under diabetic conditions, thereby improving erectile function. Specifically, PC-NVs induced endothelial proliferation and migration and reduced cell apoptosis under diabetic conditions. In addition, PC-NVs induced neural regeneration in STZ-induced diabetic mice in dorsal root ganglion and major pelvic ganglion explants in vivo and ex vivo under high-glucose conditions. We found that lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is a new target of PC-NVs in this process, demonstrating that PC-NVs exert their angiogenic and nerve-regeneration effects by activating MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt and suppressing P53 signaling pathway in an Lcn2-dependent manner. Our findings provide new conclusive evidence that PC-NVs can promote neurovascular regeneration and recovery of erectile function under diabetic conditions via an Lcn2-dependent mechanism.

AIM: In this study we aimed to determine whether HB-EGF can improve the erectile function of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and to explore the related mechanisms. METHODS: Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used for diabetes induction. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by low-dose injections of streptozotocin (50\u00a0mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days. Eight weeks after streptozotocin injections, DM was determined by measuring blood glucose and body weight. Diabetic mice were treated with two intracavernous administrations of phosphate-buffered saline (20\u00a0\u03bcL) or various doses of HB-EGF (days -3 and 0; 1, 5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcg in 20\u00a0\u03bcL of phosphate-buffered saline). The angiogenesis effect of HB-EGF was confirmed by tube formation and migration assays in mouse cavernous endothelial cells and mouse cavernous pericytes under high-glucose conditions. Erectile function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve, as well as histological examination and Western blot analysis for mechanism assessment. OUTCOMES: In vitro angiogenesis, cell proliferation, in vivo intracavernous pressure, neurovascular regeneration, cavernous permeability, and survival signaling were the outcomes measured. RESULTS: Expression of HB-EGF was reduced under diabetic conditions. Exogenous HB-EGF induced angiogenesis in mouse cavernous endothelial cells and mouse cavernous pericytes under high-glucose conditions. Erectile function was decreased in the DM group, whereas administration of HB-EGF resulted in a significant improvement of erectile function (91% of the age-matched control group) in association with increased neurovascular content, including cavernous endothelial cells, pericytes, and neuronal cells. Histological and Western blot analyses revealed a significant increase in the permeability of the corpus cavernosum in DM mice, which was attenuated by HB-EGF treatment. The protein expression of phospho-Akt Ser473 and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase Ser1177 increased after HB-EGF treatment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of HB-EGF may be an effective strategy to treat ED associated with DM or other neurovascular diseases. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Similarly to other pro-angiogenic factors, HB-EGF has dual roles in vascular and neuronal development. Our study focused on broadly evaluating the role of HB-EGF in diabetic ED. In view of the properties of HB-EGF as an angiogenic factor, its dose concentration should be strictly controlled to avoid potential side effects. CONCLUSION: In the diabetic ED mouse model in this study erectile function was improved by HB-EGF, which may provide new treatment strategies for patients with ED who do not respond to phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors."

However, the distribution of cavernous pericytes and their roles in penile erection is unclear. Herein we report that the pericytes are abundantly distributed in microvessels of the subtunical area and dorsal nerve bundle of mice, followed by dorsal vein and cavernous sinusoids. We further confirmed the presence of pericytes in human corpus cavernosum tissue and successfully isolated pericytes from mouse penis. Cavernous pericyte contents from diabetic mice and tube formation of cultured pericytes in high glucose condition were greatly reduced compared with those in normal conditions. Suppression of pericyte function with anti-PDGFR-\u03b2 blocking antibody deteriorated erectile function and tube formation in vivo and in vitro diabetic condition. In contrast, enhanced pericyte function with HGF protein restored cavernous pericyte content in diabetic mice, and significantly decreased cavernous permeability in diabetic mice and in pericytes-endothelial cell co-culture system, which induced significant recovery of erectile function. Overall, these findings showed the presence and distribution of pericytes in the penis of normal or pathologic condition and documented their role in the regulation of cavernous permeability and penile erection, which ultimately explore novel therapeutics of erectile dysfunction targeting pericyte function.

AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of oral administration of LM11A-31, a small molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) ligand and proNGF antagonist, in a mouse model of bilateral CNI, which mimics nerve injury-induced erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into sham operation and CNI groups. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups: phosphate-buffered saline and LM11A-31 (50\u00a0mg/kg/day) being administered once daily starting 3\u00a0days before CNI via oral gavage. 2 weeks after CNI, we measured erectile function by electrical stimulation of the bilateral cavernous nerve. The penis was harvested for histologic examination and Western blot analysis. The major pelvic ganglia was harvested and cultured for assays of ex\u00a0vivo neurite outgrowth. OUTCOMES: Intracavernous pressure, neurovascular regeneration in the penis, in\u00a0vivo or ex\u00a0vivo functional evaluation, and cell survival signaling were measured. RESULTS: Erectile function was decreased in the CNI group (44% of the sham operation group), while administration of LM11A-31 led to a significant improvement of erectile function (70% of the sham operation group) in association with increased neurovascular content, including cavernous endothelial cells, pericytes, and neuronal processes. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses showed significantly increased p75NTR expression in the dorsal nerve of CNI mice, which was attenuated by LM11A-31 treatment. Protein expression of active PI3K, AKT, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was increased, and cell death and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling was significantly attenuated after LM11A-31 treatment. Furthermore, LM11A-31 promoted neurite sprouting in cultured major pelvic ganglia after lipopolysaccharide exposure. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: LM11A-31 may be used as a strategy to treat erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or in men with neurovascular diseases. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Unlike biological therapeutics, such as proteins, gene therapies, or stem cells, the clinical application of LM11A-31 would likely be relatively less complex and low cost. Our study has some limitations. Future studies will assess the optimal dosing and duration of the compound. Given its plasma half-life of approximately 1\u00a0hour, it is possible that dosing more than once per day will provide added efficacy.

Nerve injury-induced protein 1, Ninjurin-1 (Ninj1), is known to be involved in neuroinflammatory processes and to be related to vascular regression during the embryonic period. AIM: The study aims to determine whether and how Ninj1 neutralizing antibody (Ninj1-Ab) restores erectile function in mice with CNI. METHODS: Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice were used and distributed into four groups: sham operation group and CNI groups receiving a single intracavernous injection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) control antibody, low-dose Ninj1-Ab (1.0 \u03bcg/20 \u03bcL), or high-dose Ninj1-Ab (2.5 \u03bcg/20 \u03bcL). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One week after bilateral cavernous nerve crush, erectile function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve. The penis was harvested for histologic examinations and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The cavernous expression of Ninj1 protein was upregulated up to 7 days after CNI and returned to baseline levels thereafter. Local delivery of Ninj1-Ab significantly increased penile neuronal nitric oxide synthase and neurofilament contents, induced cavernous endothelial proliferation and phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and decreased endothelial cell apoptosis in the CNI mice by upregulating angiopoietin-1 and downregulating angiopoietin-2. High-dose Ninj1-Ab induced profound restoration of erectile function in the CNI mice (91% of sham control values), whereas low-dose Ninj1-Ab elicited partial improvement. CONCLUSION: The dual neurotrophic and angiogenic effects of Ninj1 blockade may provide a good opportunity for treating erectile dysfunction resulting from radical prostatectomy."

However, one of the major hurdles in the clinical application of EV-based therapy is their low production yield. We recently developed cell-derived EV-mimetic nanovesicles (NVs) by extruding cells serially through filters with diminishing pore sizes (10, 5, and 1\u2009\u03bcm). Here, we demonstrate in diabetic mice that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived EV-mimetic NVs (ESC-NVs) completely restore erectile function (~96% of control values) through enhanced penile angiogenesis and neural regeneration in vivo, whereas ESC partially restores erectile function (~77% of control values). ESC-NVs promoted tube formation in primary cultured mouse cavernous endothelial cells and pericytes under high-glucose condition in vitro; and accelerated microvascular and neurite sprouting from aortic ring and major pelvic ganglion under high-glucose condition ex vivo, respectively. ESC-NVs enhanced the expression of angiogenic and neurotrophic factors (hepatocyte growth factor, angiopoietin-1, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin-3), and activated cell survival and proliferative factors (Akt and ERK). Therefore, it will be a better strategy to use ESC-NVs than ESCs in patients with erectile dysfunction refractory to pharmacotherapy, although it remains to be solved for future clinical application of ESC."

                "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an important kind of postoperative complication of pelvic surgery that affects patients' quality of life. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been found to alleviate ED caused by cavernous nerve injury (CNI) in rats. However, little is known about whether induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC) have a therapeutic effect on CNI ED. We established an ED model on rats and evaluated the effect of iMSC on it. Methods: Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four groups and received following operation: sham operation (sham group); bilateral CNI and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections (PBS group); bilateral CNI and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation (adMSC group); or bilateral CNI and iMSC injection (iMSC group). After therapy, the cavernous nerve was stimulated by electricity and the intracavernous pressure (IAP)/mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was measured. The endothelial and smooth muscle tissue in the penis was assessed histologically with Masson's trichrome stain. Immunofluorescence/immunohistochemical stains were applied for the detection of nNOS, vWF, eNOS, SMA, Desmin, S100\u03b2, and caspase-3. Nude rats CNI ED model was established for the evaluation of iMSC longevity and differentiation capacity. The paracrine factors were assessed by real-time PCR. Results: Transplantation of iMSC significantly restored the IAP/MAP in this CNI ED model and showed long-term effects. It could rescue the expression of vWF, eNOS, SMA, and Desmin, which indicated the alleviation of endothelial and smooth muscle tissues of the penis. iMSC therapy also could increase the expression of nNOS in the cavernosum and S100\u03b2 in the major pelvic ganglia (MPG) which contributed to the erectile function. Moreover, the level of BAX and caspase-3 were reduced and Bcl-2 was increased, which indicated the anti-apoptosis effects of iMSC. The iMSC showed little transdifferentiation and exerted their function by activating the secretome of the host. Conclusion: Transplantation of iMSC significantly improved ED induced by CNI. The iMSC may exert their effects via paracrine factors and may be a promising therapeutic candidate for treating CNI ED in the future."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Men with erectile dysfunction (ED) respond poorly to oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors following radical prostatectomy. Recent studies have reported that up-regulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and activation of the Smad signaling pathway play important roles in cavernous fibrosis and in the deterioration of erectile function in a mouse model of cavernous nerve injury (CNI) and in patients with spinal cord injury. The mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (Smad7) is known to inhibit the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of adenoviruses encoding Smad7 gene (Ad-Smad7) on erectile function in a mouse model of CNI. METHODS: Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice were used and distributed into 7 groups: sham operation group, untreated CNI group, and CNI groups receiving a single intracavernous injection of adenovirus encoding LacZ (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(8) virus particles [vp]/20\u2009\u03bcL) or adenovirus encoding Smad7 (Ad-Smad7; 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7), 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(8), 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(8), or 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(9) vp/20\u2009\u03bcL). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two weeks after bilateral cavernous nerve crushing and treatment, erectile function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve. The penis was harvested for histologic examinations and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The highest erectile response was noted in CNI mice treated with Ad-Smad7 at a dose of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(8) \u2009vp, which reached up to 82-85% of sham control values. Local delivery of Ad-Smad7 significantly decreased endothelial cell apoptosis and the production of extracellular matrix proteins, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibronectin, collagen I, and collagen IV, and induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in the corpus cavernosum tissue of CNI mice. CONCLUSION: The adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Smad7 successfully restored erectile function by enhancing endothelial cell function and through antifibrotic effects. These findings suggest that inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway by use of Smad7 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ED induced by radical prostatectomy."

However, the impact of PC\u2011NVs on the peripheral nervous system (PNS), such as the sciatic nerve, is unclear. In this study, PC\u2011NVs were isolated from mouse cavernous pericytes (MCPs). A sciatic nerve transection (SNT) model was established using 8\u2011week\u2011old C57BL/6J mice. The sciatic nerve was harvested 5\u00a0and\u00a014\u00a0days for immunofluorescence and western blot studies. Function studies were evaluated by performing the rotarod test and walking track analysis. The results demonstrated that PC\u2011NVs could stimulate endothelial cells, increase neuronal cell content, and increase macrophage and Schwann cell presence at the proximal stump rather than the distal stump in the SNT model, thereby improving angiogenesis and nerve regeneration in the early stage of sciatic nerve regeneration. In addition, PC\u2011NVs also increased the expression of neurotrophic factors (brain\u2011derived nerve growth factor, neurotrophin\u20113 and nerve growth factor) and the activity of the cell survival signaling pathway (PI3K/Akt signaling), and reduced the activity of the JNK signaling pathway. Additionally, after 8\u00a0weeks of local application of PC\u2011NVs in SNT model mice, their motor and sensory functions were significantly improved, as assessed by performing the rotarod test and walking track analysis. In conclusion, the present study showed that the significant improvement of neurovascular regeneration in mice following treatment with PC\u2011NVs may provide a favorable strategy for promoting motor and sensory regeneration and functional recovery of the PNS."

Men with radical prostatectomy-induced ED respond less positively to oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. AIM: The study aims to examine whether and how stromal vascular fraction (SVF) restores erectile function in mice with cavernous nerve injury (CNI). METHODS: Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were used and the animals were distributed into five groups: sham operation group and CNI group receiving a single intracavernous injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or SVF (1 \u00d7 10(4) , 1 \u00d7 10(5) , or 3 \u00d7 10(5) cells/20 \u03bcL, respectively). SVF was isolated from epididymal adipose tissues of green fluorescence protein transgenic mice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two weeks after injection, erectile function was measured by cavernous nerve stimulation. The penis was stained with antibodies to platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, phosphohistone H3, and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (phospho-eNOS). We also performed Western blot for angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), vascular endothelial growth factor-A, hepatocyte growth factor, phospho-eNOS, and eNOS in the corpus cavernosum tissue. RESULTS: Local delivery of SVF restored erectile function in a dose-dependent manner in CNI mice. The highest erectile response was noted at a dose of 3 \u00d7 10(5) cells, for which the response was comparable with that in the sham operation group. Local delivery of SVF significantly increased the expression of angiogenic factor proteins and induced cavernous endothelial cell proliferation and eNOS phosphorylation compared with that in the PBS-treated CNI group. SVF-induced promotion of cavernous angiogenesis and erectile function was diminished in the presence of soluble antibody to Tie2, a receptor tyrosine kinase of Ang-1. CONCLUSION: Secretion of angiogenic factors from SVF is an important mechanism by which SVF induces cavernous endothelial regeneration and restores erectile function. These findings suggest that cavernous endothelial regeneration by using SVF may represent a promising treatment strategy for radical prostatectomy-induced ED."

The function of Hebp1 in diabetic conditions was evaluated by tube formation assay, aorta ring assay, migration assay, intracavernous pressure, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot experiments. RESULTS: We report that Hebp1 is more highly expressed in mouse corpus cavernosum pericytes and can effectively promote endothelial cell angiogenesis under high-glucose conditions. Following exogenous administration of Hebp1 protein, we found that elevated Hebp1 levels can improve the erectile function of diabetic mice, which is achieved by reducing reactive oxygen species levels and activating the PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway.

Nerve growth factor precursor (proNGF) and its p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) have been known to be involved in microvascular complications and neurodegeneration. AIM: To examine the role of proNGF and its receptor p75NTR signaling pathway in diabetic ED, and to determine the effectiveness of proNGF neutralizing antibody (proNGF-Ab) in restoring erectile function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. METHODS: Diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg) into 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice for 5 consecutive days. At 8 weeks after the induction of diabetes mellitus, the animals were distributed into 3 groups: controls and STZ-induced diabetic mice receiving 2 intracavernous injections of either saline (days\u00a0-3 and 0; 20 \u03bcL) or proNGF-Ab (days\u00a0-3 and 0; 20 \u03bcg in 20 \u03bcL of saline). We also examined the effect of proNGF-Ab or p75NTR small interfering RNA in primary cultured mouse cavernous endothelial cells, pericytes, and major pelvic ganglion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve at 2 weeks after treatment, and the penis was then harvested for histologic and biochemical studies. RESULTS: The cavernous expression of proNGF and p75NTR was upregulated under diabetic conditions. Intracavernous injection of proNGF-Ab successfully restored erectile function in diabetic mice, which reach 93-96% of control values. ProNGF-Ab significantly restored cavernous endothelial cell, pericyte, and neuronal cell content, and increased endothelial cell-to-cell junction proteins in the diabetic mice. Under the high-glucose condition, proNGF-Ab or p75NTR small interfering RNA promoted tube formation in mouse cavernous endothelial cells and pericytes, decreased apoptosis of endothelial cells and pericytes, and enhanced neurite sprouting from major pelvic ganglion. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The ProNGF/p75NTR pathway will be a new therapeutic target for diabetic ED. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is the first study demonstrating the efficacy of the inhibition of proNGF/p75NTR pathway in diabetic ED. Further studies are needed to test whether a different dosing of proNGF-Ab would induce more durable erectile function recovery.

METHODS: Mouse corpus cavernous tissue was used for MCP primary culture and EV isolation. Small-RNA sequencing analysis was performed to assess the type and content of miRs in MCPs-EVs. Four groups of mice were used: control nondiabetic mice and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice receiving two intracavernous injections (days -\u20093 and 0) of phosphate buffered saline, MCPs-EVs transfected with reagent control, or MCPs-EVs transfected with a miR-148a-3p inhibitor. miR-148a-3p function in MCPs-EVs was evaluated by tube-formation assay, migration assay, TUNEL assay, intracavernous pressure, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting. RESULTS: We extracted EVs from MCPs, and small-RNA sequencing analysis showed miR-148a-3p enrichment in MCPs-EVs. Exogenous MCPs-EV administration effectively promoted mouse cavernous endothelial cell (MCECs) tube formation, migration, and proliferation, and reduced MCECs apoptosis under high-glucose conditions. These effects were significantly attenuated in miR-148a-3p-depleted MCPs-EVs, which were extracted after inhibiting miR-148a-3p expression in MCPs. Repetitive intracavernous injections of MCPs-EVs improved erectile function by inducing cavernous neurovascular regeneration in diabetic mice. Using online bioinformatics databases and luciferase report assays, we predicted that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) is a potential target gene of miR-148a-3p.

                "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40-70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, Limb Bud-Heart (Lbh), in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. Lbh expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes."

OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of bone morphogenetic protein 2 in stimulating angiogenesis and augmenting nerve regeneration in a mouse model of diabetic-induced erectile dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The induction of diabetes mellitus was performed by streptozotocin (50\u00a0mg/kg daily) administered intraperitoneally for 5 successive days to male C57BL/6 mice that were 8\u00a0weeks old. Eight weeks post-inductions, animals were allocated to one of five groups: a control group, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse group receiving two intracavernous 20\u00a0\u03bcL phosphate-buffered saline injections, or one of three bone morphogenetic protein 2 groups administered two injections of bone morphogenetic protein 2 protein (1, 5, or 10\u00a0\u03bcg) diluted in 20\u00a0\u03bcL of phosphate-buffered saline within a 3-day interval between the first and second injections. The erectile functions were assessed 2 weeks after phosphate-buffered saline or bone morphogenetic protein 2 protein injections by recording the intracavernous pressure through cavernous nerve electrical stimulation. Angiogenic activities and nerve regenerating effects of bone morphogenetic protein 2 were determined in penile tissues, aorta, vena cava, the main pelvic ganglions, the dorsal roots, and from the primary cultured mouse cavernous endothelial cells. Moreover, fibrosis-related factor protein expressions were evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: Erectile function recovery to 81% of the control value in diabetic mice was found with intracavernous bone morphogenetic protein 2 injection (5\u00a0\u03bcg/20\u00a0\u03bcL). Pericytes and endothelial cells were extensively restored. It was confirmed that angiogenesis was promoted in the corpus cavernosum of diabetic mice treated with bone morphogenetic protein 2 through increased ex vivo sprouting of aortic rings, vena cava and penile tissues, and migration and tube formation of mouse cavernous endothelial cells. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 protein enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in mouse cavernous endothelial cells and penile tissues, and promoted neurite outgrowth in major pelvic ganglia and dorsal root ganglia under high-glucose conditions. Furthermore, bone morphogenetic protein 2 suppressed fibrosis by reducing mouse cavernous endothelial cell fibronectin, collagen 1, and collagen 4 levels under high-glucose conditions. CONCLUSION: Bone morphogenetic protein 2 modulates neurovascular regeneration and inhibits fibrosis to revive the mouse erection function in diabetic conditions. Our findings propose that the bone morphogenetic protein 2 protein represents a novel and promising approach to treating diabetes-related erectile dysfunction."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, many studies have focused on the intestinal environment to elucidate pathogenesis of various diseases, including kidney diseases. Impairment of the intestinal barrier function, the \"leaky gut,\" reportedly contributes to pathologic processes in some disorders. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), a component of innate immunity, maintains intestinal integrity. The effects of disrupted intestinal homeostasis associated with MAVS signaling in diabetic kidney disease remains unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the contribution of intestinal barrier impairment to kidney injury under diabetic conditions, we induced diabetic kidney disease in wild-type and MAVS knockout mice through unilateral nephrectomy and streptozotocin treatment. We then assessed effects on the kidney, intestinal injuries, and bacterial translocation. RESULTS: MAVS knockout diabetic mice showed more severe glomerular and tubular injuries compared with wild-type diabetic mice. Owing to impaired intestinal integrity, the presence of intestine-derived Klebsiella oxytoca and elevated IL-17 were detected in the circulation and kidneys of diabetic mice, especially in diabetic MAVS knockout mice. Stimulation of tubular epithelial cells with K. oxytoca activated MAVS pathways and the phosphorylation of Stat3 and ERK1/2, leading to the production of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Nevertheless, MAVS inhibition induced inflammation in the intestinal epithelial cells and KIM-1 production in tubular epithelial cells under K. oxytoca supernatant or IL-17 stimulation. Treatment with neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibody treatment had renoprotective effects. In contrast, LPS administration accelerated kidney injury in the murine diabetic kidney disease model. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired MAVS signaling both in the kidney and intestine contributes to the disrupted homeostasis, leading to diabetic kidney disease progression. Controlling intestinal homeostasis may offer a novel therapeutic approach for this condition."

Administration of anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody to diabetic wild-type mice was similarly protective. IL-17 deficiency also attenuated up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL2, CXCL10 and TGF-\u03b2 in diabetic kidneys. In vitro co-stimulation with recombinant IL-17 and high glucose were synergistic in increasing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in both cultured renal tubular cells and podocytes. We conclude that absence of IL-17 signalling is protective against streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy, thus implying a pro-inflammatory role of IL-17 in its pathogenesis. Targeting the IL-17 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of this disorder."

                "abstract": "Inflammation and fibrosis are essential elements of diabetic nephropathy (DN). We tested the hypothesis that these elements are dependent upon Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signalling by examining WT and TLR2(-/-) mice in an experimental model of DN. Diabetes was induced in WT and TLR2(-/-) mice by i.p. injection of streptozotocin. Kidney injury was assessed at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after induction of diabetes. Gene expression of TLR2, its endogenous ligands and downstream cytokines, chemokines and fibrogenic molecules were upregulated in kidneys from WT mice with streptozotocin diabetes. TLR2(-/-) mice were protected against the development of DN, exhibiting less albuminuria, inflammation, glomerular hypertrophy and hypercellularity, podocyte and tubular injury as compared to diabetic WT controls. Marked reductions in interstitial collagen deposition, myofibroblast activation (\u03b1-SMA) and expression of fibrogenic genes (TGF-\u03b2 and fibronectin) were also evident in TLR2 deficient mice. Consistent with our in vivo results, high glucose directly promoted TLR2 activation in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells (TECs) in vitro, resulting in NF-\u03baB activation, inflammation and TGF-\u03b2 production. We conclude that TLR2 was required for the full development of inflammation, kidney damage and fibrosis in this model of DN. As TLR2 is known to be expressed by intrinsic kidney cells and as high concentration glucose stimulated podocytes and TECs in vitro to express TLR2 and TLR2 ligands, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in a TLR2 dependent manner in the present study, it appears likely that TLR2 signalling in intrinsic kidney cells contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.

The current study tests the hypothesis that Smad7 may play a protective role and has therapeutic potential for diabetic kidney disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Protective role of Smad7 in diabetic kidney disease was examined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice that have Smad7 gene knockout (KO) and in diabetic rats given Smad7 gene transfer using an ultrasound-microbubble-mediated technique. RESULTS: We found that mice deficient for Smad7 developed more severe diabetic kidney injury than wild-type mice as evidenced by a significant increase in microalbuminuria, renal fibrosis (collagen I, IV, and fibronectin), and renal inflammation (interleukin-1\u03b2 [IL-1\u03b2], tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], and macrophages). Further studies revealed that enhanced renal fibrosis and inflammation in Smad7 KO mice with diabetes were associated with increased activation of both TGF-\u03b2/Smad2/3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways. To develop a therapeutic potential for diabetic kidney disease, Smad7 gene was transferred into the kidney in diabetic rats by an ultrasound-microbubble-mediated technique. Although overexpression of renal Smad7 had no effect on levels of blood glucose, it significantly attenuated the development of microalbuminuria, TGF-\u03b2/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis such as collagen I and IV and fibronectin accumulation and NF-\u03baB/p65-driven renal inflammation including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 expression and macrophage infiltration in diabetic rats. CONCLUSIONS: Smad7 plays a protective role in diabetic renal injury. Overexpression of Smad7 may represent a novel therapy for the diabetic kidney complication."

Myeloid differentiation primary-response protein-88 (MyD88) is an essential adapter protein of all TLRs except TLR3 in innate immunity. It is unclear whether MyD88 could be a therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy. Here, we used a new small-molecule MyD88 inhibitor, LM8, to examine the pharmacological inhibition of MyD88 in protecting kidneys from inflammatory injury in diabetes. We showed that MyD88 was significantly activated in the kidney of STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice in tubular epithelial cells as well as in high glucose-treated rat tubular epithelial cells NRK-52E. In cultured tubular epithelial cells, we show that LM8 (2.5-10\u2009\u03bcM) or MyD88 siRNA attenuated high-concentration glucose-induced inflammatory and fibrogenic responses through inhibition of MyD88-TLR4 interaction and downstream NF-\u03baB activation. Treatment with LM8 (5, 10\u2009mg/kg, i.g.) significantly reduced renal inflammation and fibrosis and preserved renal function in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice. These renoprotective effects were associated with reduced MyD88-TLR4 complex formation, suppressed NF-\u03baB signaling, and prevention of inflammatory factor expression. Collectively, our results show that hyperglycemia activates MyD88 signaling cascade to induce renal inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of MyD88 may be a therapeutic approach to mitigate diabetic nephropathy and the inhibitor LM8 could be a potential candidate for such therapy."

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors are widely used antihyperglycemic\u00a0agents that exert renal protective and positive effects against mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

In this study, DPP4 upregulation, mitochondrial fragmentation, and altered mitochondrial dynamics-associated protein expression were observed in the tubules of\u00a0DBA2/J (D2) diabetic mice with unilateral nephrectomy and in albumin-stimulated tubular cells. The inhibition of DPP4 by sitagliptin\u00a0(Sita) ameliorated these mitochondrial perturbations both\u00a0in vivo\u00a0and\u00a0in vitro, whereas DPP4 overexpression aggravated mitochondrial fusion-fission disorder and tubular cell injury in albumin-treated HK-2 cells.

Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection in MT-deficient (MT(-/-)) and MT(+/+) mice. Urinary albumin excretion, histological changes, markers for reactive oxygen species (ROS), and kidney inflammation were measured. Murine proximal tubular epithelial (mProx24) cells were used to further elucidate the role of MT under high-glucose conditions. Parameters of diabetic nephropathy and markers of ROS and inflammation were accelerated in diabetic MT(-/-) mice compared with diabetic MT(+/+) mice, despite equivalent levels of hyperglycemia. MT deficiency accelerated interstitial fibrosis and macrophage infiltration into the interstitium in the diabetic kidney. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology in proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic MT(-/-) mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that knockdown of MT by small interfering RNA enhanced mitochondrial ROS generation and inflammation-related gene expression in mProx24 cells cultured under high-glucose conditions.

Podocyte insulin resistance is a main cause of podocyte injury, playing crucial roles by contributing to albuminuria in early DN. G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) is a metabolite sensor modulating the cell signalling pathways to maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, the roles of GPR43 in podocyte insulin resistance and its potential mechanisms in the development of DN are unclear. Methods: The experiments were conducted by using kidney tissues from biopsied DN patients, streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic mice with or without global GPR43 gene knockout, diabetic rats treated with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation, and cell culture model of podocytes. Renal pathological injuries were evaluated by periodic acid-schiff staining and transmission electron microscopy. The expression of GPR43 with other podocyte insulin resistance related molecules was checked by immunofluorescent staining, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Serum acetate level was examined by gas chromatographic analysis. The distribution of gut microbiota was measured by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing with faeces. Results: Our results demonstrated that GPR43 expression was increased in kidney samples of DN patients, diabetic animal models, and high glucose-stimulated podocytes. Interestingly, deletion of GPR43 alleviated albuminuria and renal injury in diabetic mice. Pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of GPR43 expression in podocytes increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation through the restoration of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase \u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1) activity. This effect was associated with the suppression of AMPK\u03b1 activity through post-transcriptional phosphorylation via the protein kinase C-phospholipase C (PKC-PLC) pathway. Antibiotic treatment-mediated gut microbiota depletion, and faecal microbiota transplantation from the healthy donor controls substantially improved podocyte insulin sensitivity and attenuated glomerular injury in diabetic rats accompanied by the downregulation of the GPR43 expression and a decrease in the level of serum acetate. Conclusion: These findings suggested that dysbiosis of gut microbiota-modulated GPR43 activation contributed to albuminuria in DN, which could be mediated by podocyte insulin resistance through the inhibition of AMPK\u03b1 activity."

                "abstract": "Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for >45% of new cases of dialysis. Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidant stress, pathologic features that are shared by many other chronic inflammatory diseases. The cytokine IL-17A was initially implicated as a mediator of chronic inflammatory diseases, but recent studies dispute these findings and suggest that IL-17A can favorably modulate inflammation. Here, we examined the role of IL-17A in diabetic nephropathy. We observed that IL-17A levels in plasma and urine were reduced in patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Type 1 diabetic mice that are genetically deficient in IL-17A developed more severe nephropathy, whereas administration of low-dose IL-17A prevented diabetic nephropathy in models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, IL-17A administration effectively treated, prevented, and reversed established nephropathy in genetic models of diabetes. Protective effects were also observed after administration of IL-17F but not IL-17C or IL-17E. Notably, tubular epithelial cell-specific overexpression of IL-17A was sufficient to suppress diabetic nephropathy. Mechanistically, IL-17A administration suppressed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, a central mediator of fibrosis, upregulated anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophage WAP domain protein in an AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent manner and favorably modulated renal oxidative stress and AMP-activated protein kinase activation. Administration of recombinant microglia/macrophage WAP domain protein suppressed diabetes-induced albuminuria and enhanced M2 marker expression. These observations suggest that the beneficial effects of IL-17 are isoform-specific and identify low-dose IL-17A administration as a promising therapeutic approach in diabetic kidney disease. "

We explored the role of the innate immune complement component C5a, a potent mediator of inflammation, in the pathogenesis of DKD in clinical and experimental diabetes. Marked systemic elevation in C5a activity was demonstrated in patients with diabetes; conventional renoprotective agents did not therapeutically target this elevation. C5a and its receptor (C5aR1) were upregulated early in the disease process and prior to manifest kidney injury in several diverse rodent models of diabetes. Genetic deletion of C5aR1 in mice conferred protection against diabetes-induced renal injury. Transcriptomic profiling of kidney revealed diabetes-induced downregulation of pathways involved in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Interrogation of the lipidomics signature revealed abnormal cardiolipin remodeling in diabetic kidneys, a cardinal sign of disrupted mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. In vivo delivery of an orally active inhibitor of C5aR1 (PMX53) reversed the phenotypic changes and normalized the renal mitochondrial fatty acid profile, cardiolipin remodeling, and citric acid cycle intermediates. In vitro exposure of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to C5a led to altered mitochondrial respiratory function and reactive oxygen species generation. These experiments provide evidence for a pivotal role of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in propagating renal injury in the development of DKD by disrupting mitochondrial agility, thereby establishing a new immunometabolic signaling pathway in DKD."

Recently, we showed that macrophages directly contribute to diabetic renal injury and that pharmacological blockade or genetic deficiency of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) confers kidney protection in diabetic nephropathy. However, the direct role of CCR2 in kidney-derived cells such as podocytes in diabetic nephropathy remains unclear. To study this, we developed a transgenic mouse model expressing CCR2 specifically in podocytes (Tg[NPHS2-Ccr2]) on a nephropathy-prone (DBA/2J) and CCR2-deficient (Ccr2-/-) background with heterozygous Ccr2+/- littermate controls. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. As expected, absence of CCR2 conferred kidney protection after nine weeks of diabetes. In contrast, transgenic CCR2 overexpression in the podocytes of Ccr2-/- mice resulted in significantly increased albuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, histopathologic changes, kidney fibronectin and type 1 collagen expression, podocyte loss, and glomerular apoptosis after nine weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Interestingly, there was no concurrent increase in kidney macrophage recruitment or inflammatory cytokine levels in the mice. These findings support a direct role for CCR2 expression in podocytes to mediate diabetic renal injury, independent of monocyte/macrophage recruitment. Thus, targeting the CCR2 signaling cascade in podocytes could be a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of diabetic nephropathy."

Activation of purinergic receptors, including P2Y2R has been associated with the pathogenesis of renal diseases, such as polycystic kidney and glomerulonephritis. However, the role of P2Y2R and its precise mechanisms in DN remain unknown. We hypothesised that P2Y2R deficiency may play a protective role in DN by modulating the autophagy signalling pathway. METHODS: We used a mouse model of DN by combining a treatment of high-fat diet and streptozotocin after unilateral nephrectomy in wild-type or P2Y2R knockout mice. We measured renal functional parameter in plasma, examined renal histology, and analysed expression of autophagy regulatory proteins. RESULTS: Hyperglycaemia and ATP release were induced in wild type-DN mice and positively correlated with renal dysfunction. Conversely, P2Y2R knockout markedly attenuates albuminuria, podocyte loss, development of glomerulopathy, renal tubular injury, apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis induced by DN. These protective effects were associated with inhibition of AKT-mediated FOXO3a (forkhead box O3a) phosphorylation and induction of FOXO3a-induced autophagy gene transcription. Furthermore, inhibitory phosphorylation of ULK-1 was decreased, and the downstream Beclin-1 autophagy signalling was activated in P2Y2R deficiency. Increased SIRT-1 (sirtuin-1) and FOXO3a expression in P2Y2R deficiency also enhanced autophagy response, thereby ameliorating renal dysfunction in DN.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an active role in regulating the renal inflammatory response associated with diabetes. Studies have also shown that ACE has roles in inflammation and the immune response that are independent of angiotensin II. ACE's two catalytically independent domains, the N- and C-domains, can process a variety of substrates other than angiotensin I. METHODS: To examine the relative contributions of each ACE domain to the sodium retentive state, renal inflammation, and renal injury associated with diabetic kidney disease, we used streptozotocin to induce diabetes in wild-type mice and in genetic mouse models lacking either a functional ACE N-domain (NKO mice) or C-domain (CKO mice). RESULTS: In response to a saline challenge, diabetic NKO mice excreted 32% more urinary sodium compared with diabetic wild-type or CKO mice. Diabetic NKO mice also exhibited 55% less renal epithelial sodium channel cleavage (a marker of channel activity), 55% less renal IL-1\u03b2, 53% less renal TNF-\u03b1, and 53% less albuminuria than diabetic wild-type mice. This protective phenotype was not associated with changes in renal angiotensin II levels. Further, we present evidence that the anti-inflammatory tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-asparyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), an ACE N-domain-specific substrate that accumulates in the urine of NKO mice, mediates the beneficial effects observed in the NKO. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that increasing AcSDKP by blocking the ACE N-domain facilitates sodium excretion and ameliorates diabetic kidney disease independent of intrarenal angiotensin II regulation."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetic nephropathy is an inflammatory disease with prominent leucocyte infiltration of the kidneys. While the importance of macrophages in diabetic renal injury has been clearly demonstrated, the role of lymphocytes is still unknown. We therefore examined the development of diabetic renal injury in lymphocyte-deficient mice. METHODS: Streptozotocin was used to induce diabetes in Rag1(-/-) mice, which lack mature T and B lymphocytes, and in wild-type (Rag1(+/+) ) controls. The development of renal injury was examined over 20 weeks of diabetes. RESULTS: Both groups developed equivalent diabetes, however only Rag1(+/+) mice had kidney infiltration with CD4, CD8, CD22 and forkhead box P3-positive cells, as well as glomerular immunoglobulin deposition. At 20 weeks, Rag1(+/+) mice exhibited renal hypertrophy, increased mesangial and interstitial matrix, kidney macrophage accumulation, tubular injury, progressive albuminuria and a decline in renal function. In comparison, diabetic Rag1(-/-) mice showed similar histological damage, matrix expansion, macrophage accrual and loss of renal function, but were protected from increasing albuminuria. This protection was associated with protection against loss of podocytes and glomerular podocin production, and with reduced glomerular macrophage activation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results show that lymphocytes contribute to the development of diabetic albuminuria, which may partly arise from increasing glomerular macrophage activation and podocyte damage. In contrast, lymphocytes do not appear to promote tubular injury, increased matrix deposition or decline in renal function in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Our findings suggest that innate immunity rather than adaptive immune responses are the major inflammatory contributor to the progression of diabetic renal injury."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF), mainly secreted by bone marrow-derived cells, has been known to promote glucagon-like peptide-1 production and improve glucose/lipid metabolism in mouse models of diabetes, but little is known about the functions of MYDGF in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Here, we investigated whether MYDGF can prevent the progression of DKD. METHODS: In vivo experiments, both loss- and gain-of-function strategies were used to evaluate the effect of MYDGF on albuminuria and pathological glomerular lesions. We used streptozotocin-treated Mydgf knockout and wild-type mice on high fat diets to induce a model of DKD. Then, albuminuria, glomerular lesions and podocyte injury were evaluated in Mydgf knockout and wild-type DKD mice treated with adeno-associated virus-mediated Mydgf gene transfer. In vitro and ex vivo experiments, the expression of slit diaphragm protein nephrin and podocyte apoptosis were evaluated in conditionally immortalised mouse podocytes and isolated glomeruli from non-diabetic wild-type mice treated with recombinant MYDGF. RESULTS: MYDGF deficiency caused more severe podocyte injury in DKD mice, including the disruption of slit diaphragm proteins (nephrin and podocin) and an increase in desmin expression and podocyte apoptosis, and subsequently caused more severe glomerular injury and increased albuminuria by 39.6% compared with those of wild-type DKD mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Inversely, MYDGF replenishment attenuated podocyte and glomerular injury in both wild-type and Mydgf knockout DKD mice and then decreased albuminuria by 36.7% in wild-type DKD mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and 34.9% in Mydgf knockout DKD mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, recombinant MYDGF preserved nephrin expression and inhibited podocyte apoptosis in vitro and ex vivo. Mechanistically, the renoprotection of MYDGF was attributed to the activation of the Akt/Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) pathway. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The study demonstrates that MYDGF protects podocytes from injury and prevents the progression of DKD, providing a novel strategy for the treatment of DKD.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND Diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is one of the primary causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is increasingly diagnosed in patients due to the continuous increase in the prevalence of diabetic mellitus (DM). Astragali Radix, a traditional Chinese herb, is widely administrated to ameliorate the symptoms of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, but its mechanism is still not yet fully defined. Calycosin (C\u2081\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2085) is the major active component of Astragali Radix. In this study, we analyzed the role of calycosin in diabetic nephropathy and explored its underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell activation, inflammatory cytokines expression and secretion, and protein levels were analyzed in cultured mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTEC). db/db mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/(kg\u00b7d) calycosin or control saline for 4 weeks, followed by analysis of structure injury, inflammation, and NF-\u03baB signaling activity. RESULTS Our results indicated that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly induced by advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), but calycosin remarkably reduced the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the cultured mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTEC). Calycosin effectively alleviated kidney injury in diabetic kidneys of db/db mice during the progression of diabetic renal injury, indicated by the reduction of histological injury and immunohistochemical of inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, we identified calycosin inhibited diabetes-induced inflammation in kidneys by suppressing the phosphorylation of IKBa and NF-\u03baB p65 in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Calycosin significantly ameliorated diabetes-induced renal inflammation in diabetic renal injury by inhibition of the NF-\u03baB-dependent signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro."

                "abstract": "Inflammation contributes to the tubulointerstitial lesions of diabetic nephropathy. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modulate immune responses and inflammatory diseases, but their role in diabetic nephropathy is not well understood. In this study, we found increased expression of TLR4 but not of TLR2 in the renal tubules of human kidneys with diabetic nephropathy compared with expression of TLR4 and TLR2 in normal kidney and in kidney disease from other causes. The intensity of tubular TLR4 expression correlated directly with interstitial macrophage infiltration and hemoglobin A1c level and inversely with estimated glomerular filtration rate. The tubules also upregulated the endogenous TLR4 ligand high-mobility group box 1 in diabetic nephropathy. In vitro, high glucose induced TLR4 expression via protein kinase C activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, resulting in upregulation of IL-6 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL-2) expression via I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB activation in human proximal tubular epithelial cells. Silencing of TLR4 with small interfering RNA attenuated high glucose-induced I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB activation, inhibited the downstream synthesis of IL-6 and CCL-2, and impaired the ability of conditioned media from high glucose-treated proximal tubule cells to induce transmigration of mononuclear cells. We observed similar effects using a TLR4-neutralizing antibody. Finally, streptozotocin-induced diabetic and uninephrectomized TLR4-deficient mice had significantly less albuminuria, renal dysfunction, renal cortical NF-\u03baB activation, tubular CCL-2 expression, and interstitial macrophage infiltration than wild-type animals. Taken together, these data suggest that a TLR4-mediated pathway may promote tubulointerstitial inflammation in diabetic nephropathy."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Acute and chronic kidney diseases are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide, with no specific treatments currently available for these. To enable understanding the pathophysiology of and testing novel treatments for acute and chronic kidney disease, a suitable in vivo model of kidney disease is essential. In this article, we describe two reliable rodent models (rats and mice) of efficacious kidney injury displaying acute to chronic kidney injury progression, which is also reversible through novel therapeutic strategies such as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized adult male Lewis rats and adult male wildtype (C57BL/6) mice, performed a midline laparotomy, and induced warm ischemia to both kidneys by bilateral clamping of both renal vascular pedicles for a set time, to mimic the hypoxic etiology of disease commonly found in kidney injury. RESULTS: Bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury caused marked structural and functional kidney injury as exemplified by histology damage scores, serum creatinine levels, and kidney injury biomarker levels in both rodents. Furthermore, this effect displayed a dose-dependent response in the mouse model. CONCLUSION: These rodent models of bilateral kidney IRI are reliable, reproducible, and enable detailed mechanistic study of the underlying pathophysiology of both acute and chronic kidney disease. They have been carefully optimised for single operator use with a strong track record of training both surgically trained and surgically na\u00efve operators."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has emerged as an important therapeutic target for ischemic heart disease. Currently, there is no effective therapy for reducing cardiac I/R injury. Damage-associated molecular patterns are endogenous molecules released after cellular damage to exaggerate tissue inflammation and injury. RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3), a well-established intracellular mediator of cell necroptosis and inflammation, serves as a circulating biomarker of multiple diseases. However, whether extracellular RIPK3 also exerts biological functions in cardiac I/R injury remains totally unknown. METHODS: Patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were recruited independently in the discovery cohort (103 patients) and validation cohort (334 patients), and major adverse cardiovascular events were recorded. Plasma samples were collected before and after PCI (6 and 24 h) for RIPK3 concentration measurement. Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells, and in vivo mouse models with myocardial injury induced by I/R (or hypoxia/reoxygenation) were used to investigate the role and mechanisms of extracellular RIPK3. Another cohort including patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving PCI and healthy volunteers was recruited to further explore the mechanisms of extracellular RIPK3. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, elevated plasma RIPK3 levels after PCI are associated with poorer short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction, as confirmed in the validation cohort. In both cultured cells and in vivo mouse models, recombinant RIPK3 protein exaggerated myocardial I/R (or hypoxia/reoxygenation) injury, which was alleviated by the RIPK3 antibody. Mechanistically, RIPK3 acted as a damage-associated molecular pattern and bound with RAGE (receptor of advanced glycation end-products), subsequently activating CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) to elicit the detrimental effects. The positive correlation between plasma RIPK3 concentrations and CaMKII phosphorylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the positive relationship between plasma RIPK3 concentrations and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving PCI. As a damage-associated molecular pattern, extracellular RIPK3 plays a causal role in multiple pathological conditions during cardiac I/R injury through RAGE/CaMKII signaling. These findings expand our understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of RIPK3, and also provide a promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and the associated complications."

                "title": "Comparison of Two Modern Survival Prediction Tools, SORG-MLA and METSSS, in Patients With Symptomatic Long-bone Metastases Who Underwent Local Treatment With Surgery Followed by Radiotherapy and With Radiotherapy Alone.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Survival estimation for patients with symptomatic skeletal metastases ideally should be made before a type of local treatment has already been determined. Currently available survival prediction tools, however, were generated using data from patients treated either operatively or with local radiation alone, raising concerns about whether they would generalize well to all patients presenting for assessment. The Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithm (SORG-MLA), trained with institution-based data of surgically treated patients, and the Metastases location, Elderly, Tumor primary, Sex, Sickness/comorbidity, and Site of radiotherapy model (METSSS), trained with registry-based data of patients treated with radiotherapy alone, are two of the most recently developed survival prediction models, but they have not been tested on patients whose local treatment strategy is not yet decided. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which of these two survival prediction models performed better in a mixed cohort made up both of patients who received local treatment with surgery followed by radiotherapy and who had radiation alone for symptomatic bone metastases? (2) Which model performed better among patients whose local treatment consisted of only palliative radiotherapy? (3) Are laboratory values used by SORG-MLA, which are not included in METSSS, independently associated with survival after controlling for predictions made by METSSS? METHODS: Between 2010 and 2018, we provided local treatment for 2113 adult patients with skeletal metastases in the extremities at an urban tertiary referral academic medical center using one of two strategies: (1) surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy or (2) palliative radiotherapy alone. Every patient's survivorship status was ascertained either by their medical records or the national death registry from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration. After applying a priori designated exclusion criteria, 91% (1920) were analyzed here. Among them, 48% (920) of the patients were female, and the median (IQR) age was 62 years (53 to 70 years). Lung was the most common primary tumor site (41% [782]), and 59% (1128) of patients had other skeletal metastases in addition to the treated lesion(s). In general, the indications for surgery were the presence of a complete pathologic fracture or an impending pathologic fracture, defined as having a Mirels score of \u2265 9, in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of less than or equal to IV and who were considered fit for surgery. The indications for radiotherapy were relief of pain, local tumor control, prevention of skeletal-related events, and any combination of the above. In all, 84% (1610) of the patients received palliative radiotherapy alone as local treatment for the target lesion(s), and 16% (310) underwent surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Neither METSSS nor SORG-MLA was used at the point of care to aid clinical decision-making during the treatment period. Survival was retrospectively estimated by these two models to test their potential for providing survival probabilities. We first compared SORG to METSSS in the entire population. Then, we repeated the comparison in patients who received local treatment with palliative radiation alone. We assessed model performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration analysis, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUROC measures discrimination, which is the ability to distinguish patients with the event of interest (such as death at a particular time point) from those without. AUROC typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating random guessing and 1.0 a perfect prediction, and in general, an AUROC of \u2265 0.7 indicates adequate discrimination for clinical use. Calibration refers to the agreement between the predicted outcomes (in this case, survival probabilities) and the actual outcomes, with a perfect calibration curve having an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1. A positive intercept indicates that the actual survival is generally underestimated by the prediction model, and a negative intercept suggests the opposite (overestimation). When comparing models, an intercept closer to 0 typically indicates better calibration. Calibration can also be summarized as log(O:E), the logarithm scale of the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) survivors. A log(O:E) > 0 signals an underestimation (the observed survival is greater than the predicted survival); and a log(O:E) < 0 indicates the opposite (the observed survival is lower than the predicted survival). A model with a log(O:E) closer to 0 is generally considered better calibrated. The Brier score is the mean squared difference between the model predictions and the observed outcomes, and it ranges from 0 (best prediction) to 1 (worst prediction). The Brier score captures both discrimination and calibration, and it is considered a measure of overall model performance. In Brier score analysis, the \"null model\" assigns a predicted probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome and represents a model that adds no new information. A prediction model should achieve a Brier score at least lower than the null-model Brier score to be considered as useful. The DCA was developed as a method to determine whether using a model to inform treatment decisions would do more good than harm. It plots the net benefit of making decisions based on the model's predictions across all possible risk thresholds (or cost-to-benefit ratios) in relation to the two default strategies of treating all or no patients. The care provider can decide on an acceptable risk threshold for the proposed treatment in an individual and assess the corresponding net benefit to determine whether consulting with the model is superior to adopting the default strategies. Finally, we examined whether laboratory data, which were not included in the METSSS model, would have been independently associated with survival after controlling for the METSSS model's predictions by using the multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: Between the two models, only SORG-MLA achieved adequate discrimination (an AUROC of > 0.7) in the entire cohort (of patients treated operatively or with radiation alone) and in the subgroup of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy alone. SORG-MLA outperformed METSSS by a wide margin on discrimination, calibration, and Brier score analyses in not only the entire cohort but also the subgroup of patients whose local treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone. In both the entire cohort and the subgroup, DCA demonstrated that SORG-MLA provided more net benefit compared with the two default strategies (of treating all or no patients) and compared with METSSS when risk thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 at both 90 days and 1 year, indicating that using SORG-MLA as a decision-making aid was beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting for treatment was 0.2 to 0.9. Higher albumin, lower alkaline phosphatase, lower calcium, higher hemoglobin, lower international normalized ratio, higher lymphocytes, lower neutrophils, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, higher sodium, and lower white blood cells were independently associated with better 1-year and overall survival after adjusting for the predictions made by METSSS. CONCLUSION: Based on these discoveries, clinicians might choose to consult SORG-MLA instead of METSSS for survival estimation in patients with long-bone metastases presenting for evaluation of local treatment. Basing a treatment decision on the predictions of SORG-MLA could be beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting to undergo a particular treatment strategy ranged from 0.2 to 0.9. Future studies might investigate relevant laboratory items when constructing or refining a survival estimation model because these data demonstrated prognostic value independent of the predictions of the METSSS model, and future studies might also seek to keep these models up to date using data from diverse, contemporary patients undergoing both modern operative and nonoperative treatments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study."

                "title": "Interventions for protecting renal function in the perioperative period.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various methods have been used to try to protect kidney function in patients undergoing surgery. These most often include pharmacological interventions such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin (EPO). OBJECTIVES: This review is aimed at determining the effectiveness of various measures advocated to protect patients' kidneys during the perioperative period.We considered the following questions: (1) Are any specific measures known to protect kidney function during the perioperative period? (2) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period, does any one method appear to be more effective than the others? (3) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period,does any one method appear to be safer than the others? SEARCH METHODS: In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1988 to August 2012). We originally handsearched six journals (Anesthesia and Analgesia, Anesthesiology, Annals of Surgery, British Journal of Anaesthesia, Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, and Journal of Vascular Surgery) (1985 to 2004). However, because these journals are properly indexed in MEDLINE, we decided to rely on electronic searches only without handsearching the journals from 2004 onwards. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected all randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing surgery for which a treatment measure was used for the purpose of providing renal protection during the perioperative period. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We selected 72 studies for inclusion in this review. Two review authors extracted data from all selected studies and entered them into RevMan 5.1; then the data were appropriately analysed. We performed subgroup analyses for type of intervention, type of surgical procedure and pre-existing renal dysfunction. We undertook sensitivity analyses for studies with high and moderately good methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: The updated review included data from 72 studies, comprising a total of 4378 participants. Of these, 2291 received some form of treatment and 2087 acted as controls. The interventions consisted most often of different pharmaceutical agents, such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, NAC, ANP, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and EPO or selected hydration fluids. Some clinical heterogeneity and varying risk of bias were noted amongst the studies, although we were able to meaningfully interpret the data. Results showed significant heterogeneity and indicated that most interventions provided no benefit.Data on perioperative mortality were reported in 41 studies and data on acute renal injury in 44 studies (all interventions combined). Because of considerable clinical heterogeneity (different clinical scenarios, as well as considerable methodological variability amongst the studies), we did not perform a meta-analysis on the combined data.Subgroup analysis of major interventions and surgical procedures showed no significant influence of interventions on reported mortality and acute renal injury. For the subgroup of participants who had pre-existing renal damage, the risk of mortality from 10 trials (959 participants) was estimated as odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.52; the risk of acute renal injury (as reported in the trials) was estimated from 11 trials (979 participants) as OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80. Subgroup analysis of studies that were rated as having low risk of bias revealed that 19 studies reported mortality numbers (1604 participants); OR was 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.90. Fifteen studies reported data on acute renal injury (criteria chosen by the individual studies; 1600 participants); OR was 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No reliable evidence from the available literature suggests that interventions during surgery can protect the kidneys from damage. However, the criteria used to diagnose acute renal damage varied in many of the older studies selected for inclusion in this review, many of which suffered from poor methodological quality such as insufficient participant numbers and poor definitions of end points such as acute renal failure and acute renal injury. Recent methods of detecting renal damage such as the use of specific biomarkers and better defined criteria for identifying renal damage (RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function and end-stage renal failure) or AKI (acute kidney injury)) may have to be explored further to determine any possible benefit derived from interventions used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingesting gluten. It affects approximately 1% of the UK population, but only one in three people is thought to have a diagnosis. Untreated coeliac disease may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis and lymphoma. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to define at-risk groups and determine the cost-effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in primary care. DESIGN: (1) Systematic review of the accuracy of potential diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease. (2) Routine data analysis to develop prediction models for identification of people who may benefit from testing for coeliac disease. (3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives. DATA SOURCES: For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE\u00ae (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA), Embase\u00ae (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library, Web of Science\u2122 (Clarivate\u2122, Philadelphia, PA, USA), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( WHO ICTRP ) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For the second systematic review, the following databases were searched from January 1990 to August 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews ( KSR ) Evidence, WHO ICTRP and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For prediction model development, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and a subcohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used; for estimates for the economic models, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum was used. REVIEW METHODS: For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed. RESULTS: People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (n\u2009=\u2009472) wanted to be 66% certain of the diagnosis from a blood test before starting a gluten-free diet if symptomatic, and 90% certain if asymptomatic. Cost-effectiveness analyses found that, among adults, and using serological testing alone, immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase was most cost-effective at a 1% pre-test probability (equivalent to population screening). Strategies using immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody plus human leucocyte antigen or human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability had similar cost-effectiveness results, which were also similar to the cost-effectiveness results of immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase at a 1% pre-test probability. The most practical alternative for implementation within the NHS is likely to be a combination of human leucocyte antigen and immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing among those with a pre-test probability above 1.5%. Among children, the most cost-effective strategy was a 10% pre-test probability with human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, but there was uncertainty around the most cost-effective pre-test probability. There was substantial uncertainty in economic model results, which means that there would be great value in conducting further research. LIMITATIONS: The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia). FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies. Large prospective cohort studies in which all participants receive accurate tests for coeliac disease are needed.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Renal IRI is one of the leading causes of AKI. How to effectively mitigate renal IRI is important for the recovery of renal function. The regulatory mechanism of lycopene, a natural antioxidant, in renal IRI is currently unknown. Therefore, we utilized network pharmacology and animal experiments to explore the possible mechanisms and potential targets of lycopene for alleviating renal IRI. METHODS: We obtained lycopene-regulated genes and renal IRI-related genes from the CTD database and GeneCards database, respectively. Subsequently, the two were intersected and the intersecting genes we defined as lycopene-regulated genes in renal IRI. Next, we explored their potential biological functions and mechanisms through enrichment analysis. Meanwhile, we constructed a rat renal IRI model and validated the protective effects of lycopene and related mechanisms. To further explore the Hub genes regulated by lycopene, we constructed a PPI protein interactions network and characterized the Hub genes using Cytoscape software. We also verified the expression of Hub genes using animal experiments and molecular docking techniques. Finally, we constructed TF-Hub gene and miRNA-Hub gene regulatory networks. RESULTS: We obtained a total of 255 lycopene-regulated genes and 327 renal IRI-related genes. The enrichment analysis revealed that they were closely related to the regulation of oxidative stress as well as the regulation of inflammatory factors. At the same time, the MAPK signaling pathway was significantly enriched. Next, we found in animal experiments that lycopene significantly alleviated the level of oxidative stress and inflammation during renal IRI, and had a protective effect on kidney damage. Also, we found that this protective effect may be achieved by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway. Next, we identified a total of five Hub genes using Cytoscape software: TNF, AKT1, MAPK3, IL6 and CASP3. Both animal experiments and molecular docking techniques demonstrated that lycopene can effectively regulate the expression of Hub genes. Finally, our constructed TF-Hub gene and miRNA-Hub gene regulatory network provide a theoretical basis for further regulation of Hub genes in follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that lycopene is a promising option in mitigating renal IRI. Lycopene may exert protective effects by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway."

                "title": "Toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs is caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease in which narrowing of arteries reduces blood flow to the lower limbs. PAD is common; it is estimated to affect 236 million individuals worldwide. Advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and concomitant cardiovascular disease are common factors associated with increased risk of PAD. Complications of PAD can include claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is therefore clinically important to use diagnostic tests that accurately identify PAD. Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression or intervene when indicated. Toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are amongst a suite of non-invasive bedside tests used to detect PAD. Both TBI and TSBP are commonly utilised by a variety of clinicians in different settings, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy is warranted and highly relevant to inform clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To (1) estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities at different cut-off values for test positivity in populations at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities. Secondary objectives were to investigate several possible sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including the following: patient group tested (people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, people with renal disease and general population), type of equipment used, positivity threshold and type of reference standard. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc and DARE databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 27 February 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included diagnostic case-control, cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective studies in which all participants had either a TSBP or TBI measurement plus a validated method of vascular diagnostic imaging for PAD. We needed to be able to cross-tabulate (2 x 2 table) results of the index test and the reference standard to include a study. To be included, study populations had to be adults aged 18 years and over. We included studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Studies had to use TSBP and TBI (also called toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI)), either individually, or in addition to other non-invasive tests as index tests to diagnose PAD in individuals with suspected disease. We included data collected by photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and manual or automated digital equipment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently completed data extraction using a standardised form. We extracted data to populate 2 x 2 contingency tables when available (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). Where data were not available to enable statistical analysis, we contacted study authors directly. Two review authors working independently undertook quality assessment using QUADAS-2, with disagreements resolved by a third review author. We incorporated two additional questions into the quality appraisal to aid our understanding of the conduct of studies and make appropriate judgements about risk of bias and applicability. MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 13 evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only and four evaluated both TBI and TSBP. Thirteen of the studies used colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) as a reference standard, two used computed tomography angiography (CTA), one used multi-detector row tomography (MDCT), one used angiography and one used a combination of CDU, CTA and angiography. TBI was investigated in 1927 participants and 2550 limbs. TSBP was investigated in 701 participants, of which 701 limbs had TSBP measured. Studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard. The certainty of evidence according to GRADE for most studies was very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Whilst a small number of diagnostic test accuracy studies have been completed for TBI and TSBP to identify PAD, the overall methodological quality was low, with most studies providing a very low certainty of evidence. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is therefore limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain. Future research using robust methods and clear reporting is warranted to comprehensively determine the diagnostic test accuracy of the TBI and TSBP for identification of PAD with greater certainty. However, conducting such research where some of the reference tests are invasive and only clinically indicated in populations with known PAD is challenging."

                "abstract": "Homeostatic modulation is pivotal in modern therapeutics. However, the discovery of bioactive materials to achieve this functionality is often random and unpredictive. Here, we enabled a systemic identification and functional classification of chemicals that elicit homeostatic modulation of signaling through Cdc42, a classical small GTPase of Ras superfamily. Rationally designed for high throughput screening, the capture of homeostatic modulators (HMs) along with molecular re-docking uncovered at least five functionally distinct classes of small molecules. This enabling led to partial agonists, hormetic agonists, bona fide activators and inhibitors, and ligand-enhanced agonists. Novel HMs exerted striking functionality in bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin remodelingand modified Alzheimer's disease-like behavior in mouse model. This concurrent computer-aided and experimentally empowered HM profiling highlights a model path for predicting HM landscape. One Sentence Summary: With concurrent experimental biochemical profiling and in silico computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) analysis, this study enabled a systemic identification and holistic classification of Cdc42 homeostatic modulators (HMs) and demonstrated the power of CADD to predict HM classes that can mimic the pharmacological functionality of interests. Introduction: Maintainingbody homeostasisis the ultimate keyto health. Thereare rich resources of bioactive materials for this functionality from both natural and synthetic chemical repertories including partial agonists (PAs) and various allosteric modulators. These homeostatic modulators (HMs) play a unique role in modern therapeutics for human diseases such as mental disorders and drug addiction. Buspirone, for example, acts as a PA for serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor but is an antagonist of the dopamine D 2 receptor. Such medical useto treat general anxietydisorders (GADs) has become one of the most-commonly prescribed medications. However, most HMs in current uses target membrane proteins and are often derived from random discoveries. HMs as therapeutics targeting cytoplasmic proteins are even more rare despite that they are in paramount needs (e. g. targeting Ras superfamily small GTPases). Rationale: Cdc42, a classical member of small GTPases of Ras superfamily, regulates PI3K-AKT and Raf-MEK-ERK pathways and has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and mental disorders as well as addictive diseases and cancer. We previously reported the high-throughput in-silico screening followed by biological characterization of novel small molecule modulators (SMMs) of Cdc42-intersectin (ITSN) protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Based on a serendipitously discovered SMM ZCL278 with PA profile as a model compound, we hypothesized that there are more varieties of such HMs of Cdc42 signaling, and the model HMs can be defined by their distinct Cdc42-ITSN binding mechanisms using computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) analysis. We further reasoned that molecular modeling coupled with experimental profiling can predict HM spectrum and thus open the door for the holistic identification and classification of multifunctional cytoplasmic target-dependent HMs as therapeutics. Results: The originally discovered Cdc42 inhibitor ZCL278 displaying PA properties prompted the inquiry whether this finding represented a random encounter of PAs or whether biologically significant PAs can be widely present. The top ranked compounds were initially defined by structural fitness and binding scores to Cdc42. Because higher binding scores do not necessarily translate to higher functionality, we performed exhaustive experimentations with over 2,500 independent Cdc42-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) assays to profile the GTP loading activities on all 44 top ranked compounds derived from the SMM library. The N-MAR-GTP fluorophore-based Cdc42-GEF assay platform provided the first glimpse of the breadth of HMs. A spectrum of Cdc42 HMs was uncovered that can be categorized into five functionally distinct classes: Class I-partial competitive agonists, Class II-hormetic agonists, Class III- bona fide inhibitors (or inverse agonists), Class IV- bona fide activators or agonists, and Class V-ligand-enhanced agonists. Remarkably, model HMs such as ZCL278, ZCL279, and ZCL367 elicited striking biological functionality in bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin remodeling and modified Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavior in mouse model. Concurrently, we applied Schr\u00f6dinger-enabled analyses to perform CADD predicted classification of Cdc42 HMs. We modified the classic molecular docking to instill a preferential binding pocket order (PBPO) of Cdc42-ITSN, which was based on the five binding pockets in interface of Cdc42-ITSN. We additionally applied a structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis generation for the model compounds. Then, using Schr\u00f6dinger's Phase Shape, 3D ligand alignments assigned HMs to Class I, II, III, IV, and V compounds. In this HM library compounds, PBPO, matching pharmacophoric featuring, and shape alignment, all put ZCL993 in Class II compound category, which was confirmed in the Cdc42-GEF assay. Conclusion: HMs can target diseased cells or tissues while minimizing impacts on tissues that are unaffected. Using Cdc42 HM model compounds as a steppingstone, GTPase activation-based screening of SMM library uncovered five functionally distinct Cdc42 HM classes among which novel efficacies towards alleviating dysregulated AD-like features in mice were identified. Furthermore, molecular re-docking of HM model compounds led to the concept of PBPO. The CADD analysis with PBPO revealed similar profile in a color-coded spectrum to these five distinct classes of Cdc42 HMs identified by biochemical functionality-based screening. The current study enabled a systemic identification and holistic classification of Cdc42 HMs and demonstrated the power of CADD to predict an HM category that can mimic the pharmacological functionality of interests. With artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) on the horizon to mirror experimental pharmacological discovery like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, our study highlights a model path to actively capture and profile HMs in potentially any PPI landscape. Graphic Abstract:  Identification and functional classification of Cdc42 homeostatic modulators HMs: Using Cdc42 HM model compounds as reference, GTPase activation-based screening of compound libraries uncovered five functionally distinct Cdc42 HM classes. HMs showed novel efficacies towards alleviating dysregulated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavioral and molecular deficits. In parallel, molecular re-docking of HM model compounds established their preferential binding pocket orders (PBPO). PBPO-based profiling (Red reflects the most, whereas green reflects the least, preferable binding pocket) revealed trends of similar pattern to the five classes from the functionality-based classification."

                "abstract": "Background: Neonates with suspected sepsis are commonly treated with gentamicin, an aminoglycoside. These antibiotics are associated with high risk of ototoxicity, including profound bilateral deafness, in people with the m.1555A>G mitochondrial genetic variant. Objective: This early value assessment summarised and critically assessed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the gene m.1555A>G variant in neonates and mothers of neonates needing antibiotics or anticipated to need antibiotics. Following feedback from the scoping workshop and specialist assessment subgroup meeting, we also considered the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the m.1555A>G variant in mothers prior to giving birth. Data sources: For clinical effectiveness, we searched three major databases in October 2022: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). For cost-effectiveness, in addition to the three mentioned databases we searched Cochrane and RePEc-IDEAS. Study selection: Study selection and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers (Ryan PW Kenny and Akvile Stoniute for clinical effectiveness and Hosein Shabaninejad and Tomos Robinson for cost-effectiveness). Any differences were resolved through discussion, or by a third reviewer (Nick Meader). Study appraisal: Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. One study (n\u2005=\u2005751 neonates recruited) was included in the clinical effectiveness review and no studies were included in the cost-effectiveness review. All except one outcome (test failure rate: low risk of bias) were rated as being at moderate risk of bias. The study reported accuracy of the test (sensitivity 100%, 95% confidence interval 29.2% to 100%; specificity 99.2%, 95% confidence interval 98% to 99.7%), number of neonates successfully tested (n\u2005=\u2005424/526 admissions), test failure rate (17.1%, although this was reduced to 5.7%), impact on antibiotic use (all those with a m.1555A>G genotype avoided aminoglycosides), time taken to obtain a sample (6 minutes), time to genotyping (26 minutes), time to antibiotic treatment (55.18 minutes) and the number of neonates with m.1555A>G (n\u2005=\u20053). Limitations: The economic component of this work identified key evidence gaps for which further data are required before a robust economic evaluation can be conducted. These include the sensitivity of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the gene m.1555A>G variant in neonates, the magnitude of risk for aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in neonates with m.1555A>G, and the prevalence of the m.1555A>G variant. Other potentially important gaps include how data regarding maternal inheritance may potentially be used in the clinical pathway. Conclusions: This early value assessment suggests that the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit has the potential to identify the m.1555A>G variant and to be cost-effective. The Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit dominates the current standard of care over the lifetime, as it is less costly and more effective. For a 50-year time horizon, the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit was also the dominant strategy. For a 10-year time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be \u00a3103 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Nevertheless, as anticipated, there is insufficient evidence to conduct a full diagnostic assessment of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit in neonates directly or in their mothers. This report includes a list of research priorities to reduce the uncertainty around this early value assessment and to provide the additional data needed to inform a full diagnostic assessment, including cost-effectiveness modelling.

                "title": "The effectiveness of abstinence-based and harm reduction-based interventions in reducing problematic substance use in adults who are experiencing homelessness in high income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis: A systematic review.",
                "abstract": "Background: Homelessness is a traumatic experience, and can have a devastating effect on those experiencing it. People who are homeless often face significant barriers when accessing public services, and have often experienced adverse childhood events, extreme social disadvantage, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, neglect, low self-esteem, poor physical and mental health, and much lower life expectancy compared to the general population. Rates of problematic substance use are disproportionately high, with many using drugs and alcohol to deal with the stress of living on the street, to keep warm, or to block out memories of previous abuse or trauma. Substance dependency can also create barriers to successful transition to stable housing. Objectives: To understand the effectiveness of different substance use interventions for adults experiencing homelessness. Search Methods: The primary source of studies for was the 4th edition of the Homelessness Effectiveness Studies Evidence and Gaps Maps (EGM). Searches for the EGM were completed in September 2021. Other potential studies were identified through a call for grey evidence, hand-searching key journals, and unpacking relevant systematic reviews. Selection Criteria: Eligible studies were impact evaluations that involved some comparison group. We included studies that tested the effectiveness of substance use interventions, and measured substance use outcomes, for adults experiencing homelessness in high income countries. Data Collection and Analysis: Descriptive characteristics and statistical information in included studies were coded and checked by at least two members of the review team. Studies selected for the review were assessed for confidence in the findings. Standardised effect sizes were calculated and, if a study did not provide sufficient raw data for the calculation of an effect size, author(s) were contacted to obtain these data. We used random-effects meta-analysis and robust-variance estimation procedures to synthesise effect sizes. If a study included multiple effects, we carried out a critical assessment to determine (even if only theoretically) whether the effects are likely to be dependent. Where dependent effects were identified, we used robust variance estimation to determine whether we can account for these. Where effect sizes were converted from a binary to continuous measure (or vice versa), we undertook a sensitivity analysis by running an additional analysis with these studies omitted. We also assessed the sensitivity of results to inclusion of non-randomised studies and studies classified as low confidence in findings. All included an assessment of statistical heterogeneity. Finally, we undertook analysis to assess whether publication bias was likely to be a factor in our findings. For those studies that we were unable to include in meta-analysis, we have provided a narrative synthesis of the study and its findings. Main Results: We included 48 individual papers covering 34 unique studies. The studies covered 15, 255 participants, with all but one of the studies being from the United States and Canada. Most papers were rated as low confidence (n\u2009=\u200925, or 52%). By far the most common reason for studies being rated as low confidence was high rates of attrition and/or differential attrition of study participants, that fell below the What Works Clearinghouse liberal attrition standard. Eleven of the included studies were rated as medium confidence and 12 studies as high confidence. The interventions included in our analysis were more effective in reducing substance use than treatment as usual, with an overall effect size of -0.11\u2009SD (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.27, 0.05). There was substantial heterogeneity across studies, and the results were sensitive to the removal of low confidence studies (-0.21\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.59, 0.17] - 6 studies, 17 effect sizes), the removal of quasi-experimental studies (-0.14\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.02] - 14 studies, 41 effect sizes) and the removal of studies where an effect size had been converted from a binary to a continuous outcome (-0.08\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.31, 0.15] - 10 studies, 31 effect sizes). This suggests that the findings are sensitive to the inclusion of lower quality studies, although unusually the average effect increases when we removed low confidence studies. The average effect for abstinence-based interventions compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) service provision was -0.28\u2009SD (95% CI, -0.65, 0.09) (6 studies, 15 effect sizes), and for harm reduction interventions compared to a TAU service provision is close to 0 at 0.03\u2009SD (95% CI, -0.08, 0.14) (9 studies, 30 effect sizes). The confidence intervals for both estimates are wide and crossing zero. For both, the comparison groups are primarily abstinence-based, with the exception of two studies where the comparison group condition was unclear. We found that both Assertative Community Treatment and Intensive Case Management were no better than treatment as usual, with average effect on substance use of 0.03\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.13] and -0.47\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.72, -0.21] 0.05\u2009SD, 95% CI [-0.28, 0.39] respectively. These findings are consistent with wider research, and it is important to note that we only examined the effect on substance use outcomes (these interventions can be effective in terms of other outcomes). We found that CM interventions can be effective in reducing substance use compared to treatment as usual, with an average effect of -0.47\u2009SD, 95% CI (-0.72, -0.21). All of these results need to be considered in light of the quality of the underlying evidence. There were six further interventions where we undertook narrative synthesis. These syntheses suggest that Group Work, Harm Reduction Psychotherapy, and Therapeutic Communities are effective in reducing substance use, with mixed results found for Motivational Interviewing and Talking Therapies (including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). The narrative synthesis suggested that Residential Rehabilitation was no better than treatment as usual in terms of reducing substance use for our population of interest. Authors' Conclusions: Although our analysis of harm reduction versus treatment as usual, abstinence versus treatment as usual, and harm reduction versus abstinence suggests that these different approaches make little real difference to the outcomes achieved in comparison to treatment as usual. The findings suggest that some individual interventions are more effective than others. The overall low quality of the primary studies suggests that further primary impact research could be beneficial."

                "abstract": "Background: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin condition. One of the most common skin disorders in children, atopic dermatitis typically manifests before the age of 5 years, but it can develop at any age. Atopic dermatitis is characterised by dry, inflamed skin accompanied by intense itchiness (pruritus). Objectives: To appraise the clinical and cost effectiveness of abrocitinib, tralokinumab and upadacitinib within their marketing authorisations as alternative therapies for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis compared to systemic immunosuppressants (first-line ciclosporin A or second-line dupilumab and baricitinib). Data sources: Studies were identified from an existing systematic review (search date 2019) and update searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) to November 2021, from bibliographies of retrieved studies, clinical trial registers and evidence provided by the sponsoring companies of the treatments under review. Methods: A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature was carried out and a network meta-analysis undertaken for adults and adolescents at different steps of the treatment pathway. The primary outcome of interest was a combined response of Eczema Area and Severity Index 50 + Dermatology Life Quality Index \u2265 4; where this was consistently unavailable for a step in the pathway, an analysis of Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 was conducted. A de novo economic model was developed to assess cost effectiveness from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. The model structure was informed through systematic review of the economic literature and by consulting clinical experts. Effectiveness data were obtained from the network meta-analysis. Costs and utilities were obtained from the evidence provided by sponsoring companies and standard UK sources. Results: Network meta-analyses indicate that abrocitinib 200 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg may be more effective, and tralokinumab may be less effective than dupilumab and baricitinib as second-line systemic therapies. Abrocitinib 100 mg and upadacitinib 15 mg have a more similar effectiveness to dupilumab. Upadacitinib 30 and 15 mg are likely to be more effective than ciclosporin A as a first-line therapy. Upadacitinib 15 mg, abrocitinib 200 and 100 mg may be more effective than dupilumab in adolescents. The cost effectiveness of abrocitinib and upadacitinib for both doses is dependent on the subgroup of interest. Tralokinumab can be considered cost-effective as a second-line systemic therapy owing to greater cost savings per quality-adjusted life-year lost. Conclusions: The primary strength of the analysis of the three new drugs compared with current practice for each of the subpopulations is the consistent approach to the assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness. However, the conclusions are limited by the high uncertainty around the clinical effectiveness and lack of data for the primary outcome for comparisons with baricitinib and for the adolescent and adult first-line populations. Future work and limitations: The most significant limitation that Eczema Area and Severity Index 50\u2005+\u2005Dermatology Life Quality Index\u2005\u2265\u20054 could not be obtained for the adolescent and adult first-line systemic treatment populations is due to a paucity of data for dupilumab and ciclosporin A. A comparison of the new drugs against one another in addition to current practice would be beneficial to provide a robust view on which treatments are the most cost-effective.

                "title": "Far Posterior Approach for Rib Fracture Fixation: Surgical Technique and Tips.",
                "abstract": "Background: The present video article describes the far posterior or paraspinal approach to posterior rib fractures. This approach is utilized to optimize visualization intraoperatively in cases of far-posterior rib fractures. This technique is also muscle-sparing, and muscle-sparing posterolateral, axillary, and anterior approaches have been shown to return up to 95% of periscapular strength by 6 months postoperatively1. Description: Like most fractures, the skin incision depends on the fracture position. The vertical incision is made either just medial to a line equidistant between the palpable spinous processes and medial scapular border or directly centered over the fracture line in this region. The incision and superficial dissection must be extended cranially and caudally, approximately 1 or 2 rib levels past the planned levels of instrumentation, in order to allow muscle elevation and soft-tissue retraction. Superficial dissection reveals the trapezius muscle, with its fibers coursing from inferomedial to superolateral caudal to the scapular spine, and generally coursing transversely above this level. The trapezius is split in line with its fibers (or elevated proximally at the caudal-most surface), and the underlying layer will depend on the location of the incision. The rhomboid minor muscle overlies ribs 1 and 2, the rhomboid major muscle overlies ribs 3 to 7, and the latissimus dorsi overlies the remaining rib levels. To avoid muscle transection, the underlying muscle is also split in line with its fibers. Next, the thoracolumbar fascia is encountered and sharply incised, revealing the erector spinae muscles, which comprise the spinalis thoracis, longissimus thoracis, and iliocostalis thoracis muscles. These muscles and their tendons must be sharply elevated from lateral to midline; electrocautery is useful for this because there is a robust blood supply in this region. Medially, while retracting the paraspinal musculature, visualization with this approach can extend to the head and neck of the rib, and even to the spine. Following deep dissection, the fractures are now visualized. During fracture reduction, it is critical to assess reduction of both the costovertebral joint and the costotransverse joint. With fractures closer to the spine, it is recommended to have at least 2 cm between the rib head and tubercle in order to allow 2 plate holes to be positioned on the neck of the rib; if comminution exists and plating onto the transverse process is needed, several screws are required here for stability as well. For appropriate stability if plating onto the spine is not required, a minimum of 3 locking screws on each side of the fracture are recommended. Contouring of the plates to match the curvature of the rib and to allow for proper apposition may be required with posterior rib fractures. Screws must be placed perpendicular to the rib surface. Following operative stabilization of the rib fractures, a layered closure is performed, and a soft dressing is applied. Alternatives: Nonoperative alternatives include non-opioid and opioid medications as well as corticosteroid injections for pain control. Supportive mechanical ventilation and physiotherapy breathing exercises can also be implemented as needed. Operative alternatives include open reduction and internal fixation utilizing conventional locking plates and screws. Rationale: Rib fractures are often treated nonoperatively when nondisplaced because of the surrounding soft-tissue support2,3. According to Chest Wall Injury Society guidelines, contraindications to surgical fixation of rib fractures include patients requiring ongoing resuscitation; rib fractures involving ribs 1, 2, 11, or 12, which are relative contraindications; severe traumatic brain injury; and acute myocardial infarction. Patient age of <18 years is also a relative contraindication for the operative treatment of rib fractures. The current literature does not recommend surgical fixation in this age group because these fractures typically heal as the patient ages; however, fracture-dislocations may require the use of instrumentation to prevent displacement. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not approve most plating systems for patients <18 years old4. In certain cases, including those with substantial displacement, persistent respiratory distress, pain, or fracture nonunion, stabilization with open reduction and internal fixation may be appropriate5-7. In cases of flail chest injuries, surgery is often indicated6. Flail chest injuries have been noted in the literature to have an incidence of approximately 150 cases per 100,000 injuries and have been shown to carry a mortality rate of up to 33%8,9. Surgical treatment of rib fractures has been shown to be associated with a decreased hospital length of stay and mortality rate in patients with major trauma1. Expected Outcomes: Expected outcomes of this procedure include low complication rates, decreased hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and reduced mechanical ventilation time10,11. However, as with any procedure, there are also risks involved, including iatrogenic lung injury from long screws or an aortic or inferior vena cava injury with aggressive manipulation of displaced fractured fragments, especially on the left side of the body. During open reduction, there is also a risk of injuring the neurovascular bundle. Tanaka et al. demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of postoperative pneumonia in their operative group (22%) compared with their nonoperative group (90%)12. Schuette et al. demonstrated a 23% rate of postoperative pneumonia, 0% mortality at 1 year, an average of 6.2 days in the intensive care unit, an average total hospital length of stay of 17.3 days, and an average total ventilator time of 4 days in the operative group10. Prins et al. reported a significantly lower incidence of pneumonia in operative (24%) versus nonoperative patients (47.3%; p = 0.033), as well as a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate (0% versus 17.7%; p = 0.018)3. This procedure utilizes a muscle-sparing technique, which has demonstrated successful results in the literature on the use of the posterolateral, axillary, and anterior approaches, returning up to 95% of periscapular strength, compared with the uninjured shoulder, by 6 months postoperatively1. The use of a muscle-sparing technique with the far-posterior approach represents a topic that requires further study in order to compare the results with the successful results previously shown with other approaches. Important Tips: The ipsilateral extremity can be prepared into the field to allow its intraoperative manipulation in order to achieve scapulothoracic motion and improved subscapular access.For costovertebral fracture-dislocations, the vertical incision line is made just medial to a line equidistant between the palpable spinous processes and medial scapular border.Lateral decubitus positioning can be utilized to allow for simultaneous access to fractures that extend more laterally and warrant a posterolateral approach; however, it is generally more difficult to access the fracture sites near the spine with this approach.This muscle-sparing technique is recommended to optimize postoperative periscapular strength, as previously demonstrated with other approaches.Incision and superficial dissection must be extended cranially and caudally approximately 1 or 2 rib levels past the planned levels of instrumentation in order to allow muscle elevation and soft-tissue retraction.To avoid muscle transection during surgical dissection, the underlying muscle is split in line with its fibers.During deep dissection, it can be difficult to delineate underlying muscles because these muscles have fibers that do not run in line with the trapezius, and some, like the rhomboid major, run nearly perpendicular to it.Electrocautery is useful while elevating the erector spinae muscles and tendons, as there is a robust blood supply in this region.The erector spinae muscle complex is relatively tight and adherent to the underlying ribs, which may make it difficult to achieve adequate visualization; therefore, at least 3 rib levels must be elevated to access a rib for reduction and instrumentation.Although internal rotation deformities are more common in this region, any external displacement of a fracture can lead to a muscle injury that can be utilized for access.During fracture reduction, it is critical to assess reduction of both the costovertebral joint and the costotransverse joint.Special attention must be given to contouring the implants because there are not any commercially available precontoured implants for this region at this time, and plating onto the spine remains an off-label use of any currently available implant.For the more challenging fracture patterns, the use of a right-angled power drill and screwdriver is recommended.Generally, the incision is utilized as previously described to provide access as far medial as the transverse process if needed. However, in cases in which this approach does not allow proper visualization with rib fracture-dislocations involving the posterior ribs or spine, a midline spinal incision can be utilized while working in combination with a spine surgeon.With fractures closer to the spine, it is recommended to have at least 2 cm between the rib head and tubercle in order to allow 2 plate holes to be positioned on the neck of the rib.If comminution exists and plating onto the transverse process is needed, several screws are required for stability.When measuring the length of screws to be placed in the transverse process, preoperative CT scans can be utilized.

                "title": "Bortezomib in multiple myeloma and lymphoma: a systematic review and clinical practice guideline.",
                "abstract": "QUESTIONS: In patients with multiple myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, or lymphoma, what is the efficacy of bortezomib alone or in combination as measured by survival, quality of life, disease control (for example, time to progression), response duration, or response rate?What is the toxicity associated with the use of bortezomib?Which patients are more or less likely to benefit from treatment with bortezomib? PERSPECTIVES: Evidence was selected and reviewed by two members of the Hematology Disease Site Group and by methodologists from the Program in Evidence-based Care (pebc) at Cancer Care Ontario. The practice guideline report was reviewed and approved by the Hematology Disease Site Group, which comprises hematologists, medical and radiation oncologists, and a patient representative. As part of an external review process, the report was disseminated to practitioners throughout Ontario to obtain their feedback. OUTCOMES: Outcomes of interest were overall survival, quality of life, response rates and duration, and rates of adverse events. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was conducted of the medline, embase, HealthStar, cinahl, and Cochrane Library databases for primary articles and practice guidelines. The resulting evidence informed the development of clinical practice recommendations. Those recommendations were appraised by a sample of practitioners in Ontario and modified in response to the feedback received. The systematic review and modified recommendations were approved by a review body w theithin pebc. RESULTS: The literature review found one randomized controlled trial (rct)-the only published rct of bortezomib in relapsed myeloma. A number of phase ii studies were also retrieved, including a randomized phase ii study. No randomized trials were retrieved for lymphoma. The rct found bortezomib to be superior to high-dose dexamethasone for median time to progression and 1-year survival in patients with relapsed myeloma, although grade 3 adverse events were more common in the bortezomib arm. Bortezomib is recommended as the preferred treatment option in patients with myeloma relapsing within 1 year of the conclusion of initial treatment; it may also be a reasonable option in patients relapsing at least 1 year after autologous stem-cell transplantation. PRACTICE GUIDELINE: This evidence-based series applies to adult patients with myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, or lymphoma of any type, stage, histology, or performance status. RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on the results of a large well-conducted rct, which represents the only published randomized study in relapsed myeloma, the Hematology Disease Site Group (dsg) offers the following recommendations: For patients with myeloma refractory to or relapsing within 1 year of the conclusion of initial or subsequent treatment or treatments, including autologous stem-cell transplantation, and who are candidates for further chemotherapy, bortezomib is recommended as the preferred treatment option.Bortezomib is also a reasonable option for patients relapsing at least 1 year after autologous stem-cell transplantation. The dsg is aware that thalidomide, alkylating agents, or repeat transplantation may also be options for these patients. However, evaluation of these other options is beyond the scope of this practice guideline.For patients with myeloma relapsing at least 1 year after the conclusion of alkylating agent-based chemotherapy who are candidates for further chemotherapy, further treatment with alkylating agent-based chemotherapy is recommended.Evidence is insufficient to support the use of bortezomib in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia outside of clinical trials. QUALIFYING STATEMENTS: Limited evidence supports the appropriateness of a specific time-to-relapse period as being indicative of treatment-insensitive disease. The 1-year threshold provided in the foregoing recommendations is based on the opinion of the Hematology dsg. For specific details related to the administration of bortezomib therapy, the dsg suggests that clinicians refer to the protocols used in major trials. Some of those details are provided here for informational purposes. DOSAGE: Bortezomib 1.3,g/m(2) is given as a rapid intravenous bolus over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle; a minimum of 72 hours between doses is required to allow for recovery of normal proteasome function. Vital signs should be checked before and after each dose. A complete blood count is recommended before each dose, with blood chemistries (including electrolyte and creatinine levels) monitored at a minimum on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. The dose of bortezomib should be reduced or held immediately upon development of painful neuropathy, as described in the product monograph; dose modification may also be required for peripheral sensory neuropathy without pain or for other toxicities. Most toxicities are reversible if dose modification guidelines are followed.  RESPONSE TO TREATMENT: Responses are usually apparent by 6 weeks (2 cycles). For patients achieving complete remission (determined by negative electrophoresis and immunofixation), bortezomib should be given for 2 additional cycles beyond the date of confirmed complete remission. In patients with progressive disease after 2 cycles or stable disease after 4 cycles, dexamethasone added to the bortezomib regimen (20 mg by mouth the day of and the day after each bortezomib dose) may produce an objective response. Bortezomib (with or without dexamethasone) should be continued in patients showing benefit from therapy (excluding those in complete remission) unless disease progression or significant toxicity is observed. Therapy should be discontinued in patients who do not respond to bortezomib alone if disease progression is seen within 2 cycles of the addition of dexamethasone. The Hematology dsg recognizes that thalidomide is an active agent in multiple myeloma patients who have relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation or who are refractory to alkylating agent-based chemotherapy. To date, no reported rcts have evaluated thalidomide in this role, and specifically, no trials have compared thalidomide with bortezomib. Given these limitations, the members of the Hematology dsg regard thalidomide or bortezomib as therapy alternatives to dexamethasone."

                "title": "Azathioprine for people with multiple sclerosis.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, impacting around 2.8 million people worldwide. Characterised by recurrent relapses or progression, or both, it represents a substantial global health burden, affecting people, predominantly women, at a young age (the mean age of diagnosis is 32 years). Azathioprine is used to treat chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and it is used in clinical practice as an off-label intervention for MS, especially where access to on-label disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for MS is limited. Given this, a review of azathioprine's benefits and harms would be timely and valuable to inform shared healthcare decisions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of azathioprine (AZA) for relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), compared to other disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), placebo or no treatment. Specifically, we will assess the following comparisons. AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first-choice treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for relapsing forms of MS when switching from another DMT AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo as first-choice treatment for progressive forms of MS AZA compared with other DMTs or placebo for progressive forms of MS when switching from another DMT SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an extensive search for relevant literature using standard Cochrane search methods. The most recent search date was 9 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting 12 months or more that compared azathioprine versus DMTs, placebo or no intervention in adults with MS. We considered evidence from non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) as these studies may provide additional evidence not available from RCTS. We excluded cluster-randomised trials, cross-over trials, interrupted time series, case reports and studies of within-group design with no control group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. There were three outcomes we considered to be critical: disability, relapse and serious adverse events (SAEs, as defined in the studies). We were also interested in other important outcomes: quality-of-life (QoL) impairment (mental score), short-term adverse events (gastrointestinal disorders), long-term adverse events (neoplasms) and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies: eight RCTs (1076 participants included in meta-analyses) and six NRSIs (1029 participants). These studies involved people with relapsing and progressive MS. Most studies included more women (57 to 83%) than men, with participants' average age at the onset of MS being between 29.4 and 33.4 years. Five RCTs and all six NRSIs were conducted in Europe (1793 participants); two RCTs were conducted in the USA (126 participants) and one in Iran (94 participants). The RCTs lasted two to three years, while NRSIs looked back up to 10 years. Four studies received some funding or support from commercial interests and five were funded by government or philanthropy; the other five provided no information about funding. There are three ongoing studies. Comparison groups included other DMTs (interferon beta and cyclosporine A), placebo or no treatment. Below, we report on azathioprine as a 'first choice' treatment compared to interferon beta for people with relapsing MS. None of the studies reported on any critical or important outcome for this comparison for progressive MS. No study was retrieved comparing azathioprine to placebo or other DMTs for either relapsing or progressive MS. Furthermore, the NRSIs did not provide information not already covered in the RCTs. Azathioprine as a first-choice treatment compared to other DMTs (specifically, interferon beta) for relapsing MS - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of azathioprine on the number of people with disability progression over two years compared to interferon beta (risk ratio (RR) 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 148 participants; very low certainty evidence). - Azathioprine may decrease the number of people with relapses over a one- to two-year follow-up compared to interferon beta (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86; 2 RCTs, 242 participants; low-certainty evidence). - Azathioprine may result in a possible increase in the number of people with SAEs over two years in comparison with interferon beta (RR 6.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 126.27; 1 RCT, 148 participants; low-certainty evidence). - The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of azathioprine on the number of people with the short-term adverse event of gastrointestinal disorders over two years compared to interferon beta (RR 5.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 185.57; 2 RCTs, 242 participants; very low certainty evidence). We found no evidence comparing azathioprine to other DMTs for QoL impairment (mental score), long-term adverse events (neoplasms) or mortality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine has been proposed as an alternative treatment for MS when access to approved, on-label DMTs is limited, especially in resource-limited settings. The limited evidence available suggests that azathioprine may result in a modest benefit in terms of relapse frequency, with a possible increase in SAEs, when compared to interferon beta-1b, for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The evidence for the effect on disability progression and short-term adverse events is very uncertain. Caution is required in interpreting the conclusions of this review since our certainty in the available evidence on the benefits and harms of azathioprine in multiple sclerosis is low to very low, implying that further evidence is likely to change our conclusions. An important limitation we noted in the available evidence is the lack of long-term comparison with other treatments and the failure of most studies to measure outcomes that are important to people with multiple sclerosis, such as quality of life and cognitive decline. This is especially the case in the evidence relevant to people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis."

                "title": "Radiation protection following nuclear power accidents: a survey of putative mechanisms involved in the radioprotective actions of taurine during and after radiation exposure.",
                "abstract": "There are several animal experiments showing that high doses of ionizing radiation lead to strongly enhanced leakage of taurine from damaged cells into the extracellular fluid, followed by enhanced urinary excretion. This radiation-induced taurine depletion can itself have various harmful effects (as will also be the case when taurine depletion is due to other causes, such as alcohol abuse or cancer therapy with cytotoxic drugs), but taurine supplementation has been shown to have radioprotective effects apparently going beyond what might be expected just as a consequence of correcting the harmful consequences of taurine deficiency per se. The mechanisms accounting for the radioprotective effects of taurine are, however, very incompletely understood. In this article an attempt is made to survey various mechanisms that potentially might be involved as parts of the explanation for the overall beneficial effect of high levels of taurine that has been found in experiments with animals or isolated cells exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. It is proposed that taurine may have radioprotective effects by a combination of several mechanisms: (1) during the exposure to ionizing radiation by functioning as an antioxidant, but perhaps more because it counteracts the prooxidant catalytic effect of iron rather than functioning as an important scavenger of harmful molecules itself, (2) after the ionizing radiation exposure by helping to reduce the intensity of the post-traumatic inflammatory response, and thus reducing the extent of tissue damage that develops because of severe inflammation rather than as a direct effect of the ionizing radiation per se, (3) by functioning as a growth factor helping to enhance the growth rate of leukocytes and leukocyte progenitor cells and perhaps also of other rapidly proliferating cell types, such as enterocyte progenitor cells, which may be important for immunological recovery and perhaps also for rapid repair of various damaged tissues, especially in the intestines, and (4) by functioning as an antifibrogenic agent. A detailed discussion is given of possible mechanisms involved both in the antioxidant effects of taurine, in its anti-inflammatory effects and in its role as a growth factor for leukocytes and nerve cells, which might be closely related to its role as an osmolyte important for cellular volume regulation because of the close connection between cell volume regulation and the regulation of protein synthesis as well as cellular protein degradation. While taurine supplementation alone would be expected to exert a therapeutic effect far better than negligible in patients that have been exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation, it may on theoretical grounds be expected that much better results may be obtained by using taurine as part of a multifactorial treatment strategy, where it may interact synergistically with several other nutrients, hormones or other drugs for optimizing antioxidant protection and minimizing harmful posttraumatic inflammatory reactions, while using other nutrients to optimize DNA and tissue repair processes, and using a combination of good diet, immunostimulatory hormones and perhaps other nontoxic immunostimulants (such as beta-glucans) for optimizing the recovery of antiviral and antibacterial immune functions. Similar multifactorial treatment strategies may presumably be helpful in several other disease situations (including severe infectious diseases and severe asthma) as well as for treatment of acute intoxications or acute injuries (both mechanical ones and severe burns) where severely enhanced oxidative and/or nitrative stress and/or too much secretion of vasodilatory neuropeptides from C-fibres are important parts of the pathogenetic mechanisms that may lead to the death of the patient. Some case histories (with discussion of some of those mechanisms that may have been responsible for the observed therapeutic outcome) are given for illustration of the likely validity of these concepts and their relevance both for treatment of severe infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.

                "title": "Ceftazidime with avibactam for treating severe aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections: technology evaluation to inform a novel subscription-style payment model.",
                "abstract": "Background: To limit the use of antimicrobials without disincentivising the development of novel antimicrobials, there is interest in establishing innovative models that fund antimicrobials based on an evaluation of their value as opposed to the volumes used. The aim of this project was to evaluate the population-level health benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam in the NHS in England, for the treatment of severe aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections when used within its licensed indications. The results were used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance in support of commercial discussions regarding contract value between the manufacturer and NHS England. Methods: The health benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam was first derived for a series of high-value clinical scenarios. These represented uses that were expected to have a significant impact on patients' mortality risks and health-related quality of life. Patient-level costs and health-related quality of life of ceftazidime-avibactam under various usage scenarios compared with alternative management strategies in the high-value clinical scenarios were quantified using decision modelling. Results were reported as incremental net health effects expressed in quality-adjusted life-years, which were scaled to 20-year population in quality-adjusted life-years using infection number forecasts based on data from Public Health England. The outcomes estimated for the high-value clinical scenarios were extrapolated to other expected uses for ceftazidime-avibactam. Results: The clinical effectiveness of ceftazidime-avibactam relative to its comparators was estimated by synthesising evidence on susceptibility of the pathogens of interest to the antimicrobials in a network meta-analysis. In the base case, ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with a statistically significantly higher susceptibility relative to colistin (odds ratio 7.24, 95% credible interval 2.58 to 20.94). The remainder of the treatments were associated with lower susceptibility than colistin (odds ratio < 1). The results were sensitive to the definition of resistance and the studies included in the analysis. In the base case, patient-level benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam was between 0.08 and 0.16 quality-adjusted life-years, depending on the site of infection and the usage scenario. There was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the benefits of ceftazidime-avibactam across all subgroups, and the results were sensitive to assumptions in the meta-analysis used to estimate susceptibility. There was substantial uncertainty in the number of infections that are suitable for treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam, so population-level results are presented for a range of scenarios for the current infection numbers, the expected increases in infections over time, and rates of emergence of resistance. The population-level benefit varied substantially across the scenarios, from 531 to 2342 quality-adjusted life-years over 20 years. Conclusion: This work has provided quantitative estimates of the value of ceftazidime-avibactam within its areas of expected usage within the NHS. Limitations: Given existing evidence, the estimates of the value of ceftazidime-avibactam are highly uncertain. Future work: Future evaluations of antimicrobials would benefit from improvements to NHS data linkages, research to support appropriate synthesis of susceptibility studies, and application of routine data and decision modelling to assess enablement value.

                "title": "Medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a historical non-interventional cohort study with validation against RCT results.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment is informed by randomised controlled trial results, but it is unclear if these findings apply to people excluded from these trials. We used data from the TORCH (TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health) randomised controlled trial to validate non-interventional methods for assessing the clinical effectiveness of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, before applying these methods to the analysis of people who would have been excluded from TORCH. OBJECTIVES: To validate the use of non-interventional Clinical Practice Research Datalink data and methods for estimating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment effects against trial results, and, using validated methods, to determine treatment effects in people who would have been excluded from the TORCH trial. DESIGN: A historical non-interventional cohort design, including validation against randomised controlled trial results. SETTING: The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: People aged \u2265\u200918 years with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD between January 2000 and January 2017. For objective 1, we prepared a cohort that was analogous to the TORCH trial cohort by applying TORCH trial inclusion/exclusion criteria followed by individual matching to TORCH trial participants. For objectives 2 and 3, we prepared cohorts that were analogous to the TORCH trial that, nevertheless, would not have been eligible for the TORCH trial because of age, asthma, comorbidity or mild disease. INTERVENTIONS: The long-acting beta-2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroid combination product Seretide (GlaxoSmithKline plc) [i.e. fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol (FP-SAL)] compared with (1) no FP-SAL exposure or (2) exposure to salmeterol (i.e. the long-acting beta-2 agonist) only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Exacerbations, mortality, pneumonia and time to treatment change. RESULTS: For objective 1, the exacerbation rate ratio was comparable to that in the TORCH trial for FP-SAL compared with salmeterol (0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.97, vs. TORCH trial 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.95), but not for FP-SAL compared with no FP-SAL (1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.42, vs. TORCH trial 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.81). Active comparator results were also consistent with the TORCH trial for mortality (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.32, vs. TORCH trial hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.13) and pneumonia (risk ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.87, vs. TORCH trial risk ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.73). For objectives 2 and 3, active comparator results were consistent with the TORCH trial for exacerbations, with the exception of people with milder chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in whom we observed a stronger protective association (risk ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.70, vs. TORCH trial risk ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.97). For the analysis of mortality, we saw a lack of association with being prescribed FP-SAL (vs. being prescribed salmeterol), with the exception of those with prior asthma, for whom we observed an increase in mortality (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.85, vs. TORCH trial-analogous HR 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.32). CONCLUSIONS: Routinely collected electronic health record data can be used to successfully measure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment effects when comparing two treatments, but not for comparisons between active treatment and no treatment. Analyses involving patients who would have been excluded from trials mostly suggests that treatment effects for FP-SAL are similar to trial effects, although further work is needed to characterise a small increased risk of death in those with concomitant asthma. LIMITATIONS: Some of our analyses had small numbers. FUTURE WORK: The differences in treatment effects that we found should be investigated further in other data sets. Currently recommended chronic obstructive pulmonary disease inhaled combination therapy (other than FP-SAL) should also be investigated using these methods.

                "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the predictive capabilities of a radiomics signature obtained from arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging in forecasting and detecting stages of kidney damage in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), as well as to analyze the correlation between texture feature parameters and biological clinical indicators. Additionally, this study seeks to identify the imaging risk factors associated with early renal injury in diabetic patients, with the ultimate goal of offering novel insights for predicting and diagnosing early renal injury and its progression in patients with DM. Materials and methods: In total, 42 healthy volunteers (Group A); 68 individuals with diabetes (Group B) who exhibited microalbuminuria, defined by a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)< 30 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within the range of 60-120 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2; and 53 patients with diabetic nephropathy (Group C) were included in the study. ASL using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3.0T was conducted. The radiologist manually delineated regions of interest (ROIs) on the ASL maps of both the right and left kidney cortex. Texture features from the ROIs were extracted utilizing MaZda software. Feature selection was performed utilizing a range of methods, such as the Fisher coefficient, mutual information (MI), probability of classification error, and average correlation coefficient (POE + ACC). A radiomics model was developed to detect early diabetic renal injury, extract imaging risk factors associated with early diabetic renal injury, and examine the relationship between significant texture feature parameters and biological clinical indicators. Patients with DM and kidney injury were followed prospectively. The study utilized seven machine learning algorithms to develop a detective radiomics model and a comprehensive predictive model for assessing the progression of kidney damage in patients with DM. The diagnostic efficacy of the models in detecting variations in diabetic kidney damage over time was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Empower (R) was used to establish a correlation between clinical biological indicators and texture feature metrics. Statistical analysis was conducted using R, Python, MedCalc 15.8, and GraphPad Prism 8. Results: A total of 367 texture features were extracted from the ROIs in the kidneys and refined based on selection criteria using MaZda software across groups A, B, and C. The renal blood flow (RBF) values of the renal cortex in groups A, B, and C exhibited a decreasing trend, with values of 256.458 \u00b1 54.256 mL/100g/min, 213.846 \u00b1 52.109 mL/100g/min, and 170.204 \u00b1 34.992 mL/100g/min, respectively. There was a positive correlation between kidney RBF and eGFR (r = 0.439, P<0.001). The negative correlation between RBF and various clinical parameters including urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr) was investigated. Through the use of a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, the study identified the eight most significant texture features and biological indicators, namely GeoY, GeoRf, GeoRff, GeoRh, GeoW8, GeoW12, S (0, 4) Entropy, and S (5, -5) Entropy. Spearman correlation analysis revealed associations between imaging markers in early diabetic patients with kidney damage and factors such as age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST) albumin, uric acid (UA), microalbuminuria (UMA), UACR, 24h urinary protein, fasting blood glucose (FBG), two hours postprandial blood glucose (P2BG), and HbA1c. The study utilized ASL imaging as a detection model to identify renal injury in patients with DM across different stages, achieving a sensitivity of 85.1%, specificity of 65.5%, and an AUC of 0.865. Additionally, a comprehensive prediction model combining imaging labels and biological indicators, with the naive Bayes machine learning algorithm as the best model, demonstrated an AUC of 0.734, accuracy of 0.74, and precision of 0.43. Conclusion: ASL imaging sequences demonstrated the ability to accurately detect alterations in kidney function and blood flow in patients with DM. Strong associations were observed between renal blood flow values in ASL imaging and established clinical biomarkers. These values show promise in detecting early microstructural changes in the kidneys of diabetic patients. Utilizing image markers in conjunction with clinical indicators was effective in identifying early renal dysfunction and its progression in individuals with DM. Furthermore, the integration of imaging texture feature parameters with clinical biomarkers holds significant potential for predicting early renal damage and its progression in patients with diabetes."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure (BP), with dysregulation of RAAS resulting in hypertension and potentially heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), cardio-renal syndrome, and stroke. RAAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have advantages beyond BP control. However, differences between these two drug classes need to be considered when choosing a therapy for preventing cardiovascular events. METHODS: A panel of 36 Egyptian cardiologists developed consensus statements on RAAS inhibitors for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes and stroke, using a modified three-step Delphi process. RESULTS: The consensus statements highlight the importance of effective BP control and the role of RAAS blockade for prevention and management of various cardiovascular diseases. ACEis and ARBs differ in their mode of action and, thus, clinical effects. On the basis of available evidence, the consensus group recommended the following: ACEis should be considered as first choice (in preference to ARBs) to reduce the risk of MI, for primary prevention of HF, and for secondary prevention of stroke. ACEis and ARBs show equivalent efficacy for the primary prevention of stroke. Evidence also favors the preferential use of ACEis in patients with type 2 diabetes, for BP control, for the primary prevention of diabetic kidney disease, and to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Treatment with an ACEi should be started within 24 h of ST segment elevation MI (and continued long term) in patients with HF, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and/or diabetes. Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) are the first choice for patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, with ACEis being the second choice in this group. ARBs are indicated as alternatives in patients who cannot tolerate ACEis. ACEis may be associated with cough development, but the incidence tends to be overestimated, and the risk can be reduced by use of a lipophilic ACEi or combining the ACEi with a calcium channel blocker. CONCLUSION: RAAS blockade is an essential component of hypertension therapy; however, the protective effects provided by ACEis are superior to those of ARBs. Therefore, an ACEi is indicated in almost all cases, unless not tolerated."

                "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health concern, affecting at least 1 in 7 adults in the United States, and accounting for a large proportion of healthcare spending. The risk of mortality rises steeply with declining kidney function, mostly due to cardiovascular-related deaths. Since CKD is asymptomatic in the early stages, diagnosis is sometimes delayed. However, early diagnosis is important for timely initiation of interventions to reduce disease progression, and to avoid the need for hospitalizations, dialysis, or kidney transplantation. This review focuses on the impact of sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on CKD based on mechanistic and clinical trial evidence. These agents affect the kidneys through changes in sodium transport and metabolic factors that interfere with the primary pathological mechanisms shared by most kidney diseases. Following clinical trials of SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes which demonstrated reductions in the risk of major adverse CV events, death, and hospitalizations for heart failure (HHF), and in patients with heart failure (HF) with and without diabetes which showed reductions in death and HHF, recent trials in patients with CKD have provided overwhelming support for the use of SGLT2i as foundational therapy across a broad spectrum of patients with CKD, regardless of diabetes status, primary kidney disease (except polycystic kidney disease), or kidney function. While clinical trials in CKD generally recruit patients with a high risk of events, patients at lower risk could also benefit from SGLT2i in terms of reduction of CKD progression, HF, and death, as well as other beneficial effects including reductions in blood sugar, body weight, and blood pressure."

                "title": "Dynamic Field Theory of Executive Function: Identifying Early Neurocognitive Markers.",
                "abstract": "In this Monograph, we explored neurocognitive predictors of executive function (EF) development in a cohort of children followed longitudinally from 30 to 54 months of age. We tested predictions of a dynamic field model that explains development in a benchmark measure of EF development, the dimensional change card sort (DCCS) task. This is a rule-use task that measures children's ability to switch between sorting cards by shape or color rules. A key developmental mechanism in the model is that dimensional label learning drives EF development. Data collection began in February 2019 and was completed in April 2022 on the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee. Our cohort included 20 children (13 female) all of whom were White (not Hispanic/Latinx) from an urban area in southern United States, and the sample annual family income distribution ranged from low to high (most families falling between $40,000 and 59,000 per year (note that we address issues of generalizability and the small sample size throughout the monograph)). We tested the influence of dimensional label learning on DCCS performance by longitudinally assessing neurocognitive function across multiple domains at 30 and 54 months of age. We measured dimensional label learning with comprehension and production tasks for shape and color labels. Simple EF was measured with the Simon task which required children to respond to images of a cat or dog with a lateralized (left/right) button press. Response conflict was manipulated in this task based on the spatial location of the stimulus which could be neutral (central), congruent, or incongruent with the spatial lateralization of the response. Dimensional understanding was measured with an object matching task requiring children to generalize similarity between objects that matched within the dimensions of color or shape. We first identified neural measures associated with performance and development on each of these tasks. We then examined which of these measures predicted performance on the DCCS task at 54 months. We measured neural activity with functional near-infrared spectroscopy across bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Our results identified an array of neurocognitive mechanisms associated with development within each domain we assessed. Importantly, our results suggest that dimensional label learning impacts the development of EF. Neural activation in left frontal cortex during dimensional label production at 30 months of age predicted EF performance at 54 months of age. We discussed these results in the context of efforts to train EF with broad transfer. We also discussed a new autonomy-centered EF framework. The dynamic field model on which we have motivated the current research makes decisions autonomously and various factors can influence the types of decisions that the model makes. In this way, EF is a property of neurocognitive dynamics, which can be influenced by individual factors and contextual effects. We also discuss how this conceptual framework can generalize beyond the specific example of dimensional label learning and DCCS performance to other aspects of EF and how this framework can help to understand how EF unfolds in unique individual, cultural, and contextual factors. Measures of EF during early childhood are associated with a wide range of development outcomes, including academic skills and quality of life. The hope is that broad aspects of development can be improved by implementing interventions aimed at facilitating EF development. However, this promise has been largely unrealized. Previous work on EF development has been limited by a focus on EF components, such as inhibition, working memory, and switching. Similarly, intervention research has focused on practicing EF tasks that target these specific components of EF. While performance typically improves on the practiced task, improvement rarely generalizes to other EF tasks or other developmental outcomes. The current work is unique because we looked beyond EF itself to identify the lower-level learning processes that predict EF development. Indeed, the results of this study identify the first learning mechanism involved in the development of EF. Although the work here provides new targets for interventions in future work, there are also important limitations. First, our sample is not representative of the underlying population of children in the United States under the age of 5. This is a problem in much of the existing developmental cognitive neuroscience research. We discussed challenges to the generalizability of our findings to the population at large. This is particularly important given that our theory is largely contextual, suggesting that children's unique experiences with learning labels for visual dimensions will impact EF development. Second, we identified a learning mechanism to target in future intervention research; however, it is not clear whether such interventions would benefit all children or how to identify children who would benefit most from such interventions. We also discuss prospective lines of research that can address these limitations, such as targeting families that are typically underrepresented in research, expanding longitudinal studies to examine longer term outcomes such as school-readiness and academic skills, and using the dynamic field (DF) model to systematically explore how exposure to objects and labels can optimize the neural representations underlying dimensional label learning. Future work remains to understand how such learning processes come to define the contextually and culturally specific skills that emerge over development and how these skills lay the foundation for broad developmental trajectories."

            "abstract": "Animal models that recapitulate human diseases and disorders are widely used to investigate etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of those conditions in people. Disorders during pregnancy are particularly difficult to explore as interventions in pregnant women are not easily performed. Therefore, models that allow for pre-conception investigations are advantageous for elucidating the mechanisms involved in adverse pregnancy outcomes that are responsible for both maternal and fetal morbidity, such as preeclampsia. The Blood Pressure High (BPH)/5 mouse model has been used extensively to study the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The female BPH/5 mouse is obese with increased adiposity and borderline hypertension, both of which are exacerbated with pregnancy making it a model of superimposed preeclampsia. Thus, the BPH/5 model shares traits with a large majority of women with pre-existing conditions that predisposes them to preeclampsia. We sought to explore the genome of the BPH/5 female mouse and determine the genetic underpinnings that may contribute to preeclampsia-associated phenotypes in this model. Using a whole genome sequencing approach, we are the first to characterize the genetic mutations in BPH/5 female mice that make it unique from the closely related BPH/2 model and the normotensive background strain, C57Bl/6. We found the BPH/5 female mouse to be uniquely different from BPH/2 and C57Bl/6 mice with a genetically complex landscape. The majority of non-synonymous consequences within the coding region of BPH/5 females were missense mutations found most abundant on chromosome X when comparing BPH/5 and BPH/2, and on chromosome 8 when comparing BPH/5 to C57Bl/6. Genetic mutations in BPH/5 females largely belong to immune system-related processes, with overlap between BPH/5 and BPH/2 models. Further studies examining each gene mutation during pregnancy are warranted to determine key contributors to the BPH/5 preeclamptic-like phenotype and to identify genetic similarities to women that develop preeclampsia."

In addition to being a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity/mortality, epidemiological and prospective studies have revealed long-term consequences for both the mother and baby of preeclamptic pregnancies, including chronic hypertension as well as other cardiovascular diseases and metabolic derangements. To better understand the effect of in utero exposure of PE on offspring, we utilized the BPH/5 mouse, a spontaneous model of the maternal and fetal PE syndrome. We hypothesized that young BPH/5 offspring would have altered metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes. Indeed, BPH/5 growth-restricted offspring showed excess catch-up growth by early adulthood due to hyperphagia and increased white adipose tissue (WAT) accumulation, with inflammation markers isolated to the reproductive WAT depot only. Both excessive WAT accumulation and the inflammatory WAT phenotype were corrected by pair-feeding young BPH/5 female mice. We also found that young BPH/5 female mice showed evidence of leptin resistance. Indeed, chronic hyperleptinemia has been shown to characterize other rodent models of PE; however, the maternal metabolic profile before pregnancy has not been fully understood. Furthermore, we found that these mice show signs of cardiovascular anomalies (hypertension and cardiomegaly) and altered signaling within the reproductive axis in early life. Future studies will involve challenging the physiological metabolic state of BPH/5 mice through pair-feeding to reduce WAT before pregnancy and determining its causal role in adverse pregnancy outcomes."

                "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by abnormal placental development with an unknown etiology. To better understand which women will develop PE, a number of maternal risk factors have been identified, including obesity. Visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) contains inflammatory mediators that may contribute to PE. To explore this, we utilized the blood pressure high (BPH)/5 mouse model of superimposed PE that spontaneously recapitulates the maternal PE syndrome. We hypothesized that BPH/5 visceral WAT adjacent to the female reproductive tract (reproductive WAT) is a source of complement factors that contribute to the inflammatory milieu and angiogenic imbalance at the maternal-fetal interface in this model and in preeclamptic women. To test our hypothesis, we calorie-restricted BPH/5 females for two weeks prior to pregnancy and the first seven days of pregnancy, which attenuated complement component 3 (C3) but not complement factor B, nor complement factor D, (adipsin) in the reproductive WAT or the implantation site in BPH/5. Furthermore, calorie restriction during pregnancy restored vascular endothelial and placental growth factor mRNA levels in the BPH/5 implantation site. These data show maternal reproductive WAT may be a source of increased C3 during pregnancy, which is increased at the maternal-fetal interface in preeclamptic BPH/5 mice. It also suggests that calorie restriction could regulate inflammatory mediators thought to contribute to placental dysfunction in PE. Future studies are necessary to examine the effect of calorie restriction on C3 throughout pregnancy and the role of maternal obesity in PE."

We hypothesized that the Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rat, a genetic model of hypertension and kidney disease, is a spontaneous model of superimposed preeclampsia. The Dahl S was compared with the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat, a strain with a well-characterized normal pregnancy, and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a genetic model of hypertension that does not experience a preeclamptic phenotype despite preexisting hypertension. Mean arterial pressure (MAP, measured via telemetry) was elevated in the Dahl S and SHR before pregnancy, but hypertension was exacerbated during pregnancy only in Dahl S. In contrast, SD and SHR exhibited significant reductions in MAP consistent with normal pregnancy. Dahl S rats exhibited a severe increase in urinary protein excretion, glomerulomegaly, increased placental hypoxia, increased plasma soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and increased placental production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The Dahl S did not exhibit the expected decrease in uterine artery resistance during late pregnancy in contrast to the SD and SHR. Dahl S pups and litter sizes were smaller than in the SD. The Dahl S phenotype is consistent with many of the characteristics observed in human superimposed preeclampsia, and we propose that the Dahl S should be considered further as a spontaneous model to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of superimposed preeclampsia and to identify and test new therapeutic targets for its treatment.

PE is also associated with long-term risk of hypertension and stroke for both mother and fetus. Currently, the only \"cure\" is delivery of the baby and placenta, largely because the pathogenesis of PE is not yet fully understood. PE is associated with impaired vascular remodeling at the maternal-fetal interface and placental insufficiency; however, specific factors contributing to this impairment have not been identified. To identify molecular pathways involved in PE, we examined temporal transcriptomic changes occurring within the uterus, uterine implantation sites, and placentae from the Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rat model of superimposed PE compared with Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We hypothesized that targeted gene analysis and whole transcriptome analysis would identify genetic factors that contribute to development of the preeclamptic phenotype in the Dahl S rat and unveil novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and mechanistic pathways in PE. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and whole genome microarray analysis were performed on isolated total RNA from uterus (day 0), uterine implantation sites (days 7 and 10), and placenta (days 14 and 20). We found 624, 332, 185, and 366 genes to be differentially expressed between Dahl S (PE) and SD (normal pregnancy) on days 0, 7, 10, and 14, respectively.

                "abstract": "Preeclampsia risk is influenced by both the mother's genetic background and the genetics of her fetus; however, the specific genes responsible for conferring preeclampsia risk have largely remained elusive. Evidence that preeclampsia has a genetic predisposition was first detailed in the early 1960s, and overall preeclampsia heritability is estimated at \u223c55%. Many traditional gene discovery approaches have been used to investigate the specific genes that contribute to preeclampsia risk, but these have largely not been successful or reproducible. Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies have allowed for significant advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of many common diseases. Genome-wide association studies are predicated on the idea that the genetic basis of many common diseases are complex and polygenic with many variants, each with modest effects that contribute to disease risk. Using this approach in preeclampsia, a large genome-wide association study recently identified and replicated the first robust fetal genomic region associated with excess risk. A screen of >7 million genetic variants in 2658 offspring from preeclamptic women and 308,292 population controls identified a single association signal close to the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 gene, on chromosome 13. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 encodes soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, a splice variant of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor that exerts antiangiogenic activity by inhibiting signaling of proangiogenic factors. The Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 pathway is central in preeclampsia pathogenesis because excess circulating soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 in the maternal plasma leads to the hallmark clinical features of preeclampsia, including hypertension and proteinuria. The success of this landmark fetal preeclampsia genome-wide association study suggests that well-powered, larger maternal and fetal genome-wide association study will be fruitful in identifying additional common variants that implicate causal preeclampsia genes and pathways. Such efforts will rely on the continued development of large preeclampsia consortia focused on preeclampsia genetics to obtain adequate sample sizes, detailed clinical phenotyping, and matched maternal-fetal samples. In summary, the fetal preeclampsia genome-wide association study represents an exciting advance in preeclampsia biology, suggesting that dysregulation at the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 locus in the fetal genome (likely in the placenta) is a fundamental molecular defect in preeclampsia."

                "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia is a potentially life-threatening disease of women during pregnancy leading to hypertension and proteinuria. It affects 1 in 15 pregnancies but, despite intense research efforts, the cause of the disease remains mysterious. Because pre-eclampsia only occurs during pregnancy and its symptoms resolve after delivery, factors from the placenta are thought to be involved. The role of the placenta could be production of 'abnormal' factors that initiate widespread inflammation and vaso-constriction. Alternatively, because the placenta normally contributes to maternal cardiovascular adaptations of pregnancy, it may be that normal placental functions fail in pre-eclampsia or that susceptibilities in the mother to hypertensive, vascular and/or renal disease prevent the appropriate normal responses to them. The potential contributions of both maternal and fetal genes to the onset of the disease have complicated the genetic analysis of the disease in humans. Recent studies have identified strains of transgenic and mutant mice that develop the hallmark features of pre-eclampsia-like disease - gestational hypertension, proteinuria and kidney lesions (glomerulosclerosis). Comparison of three different mouse models suggests that pre-eclampsia can be initiated by at least three independent mechanisms: pre-existing borderline maternal hypertension that is exacerbated by pregnancy (BPH/5 strain of mice), elevated levels of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II in the maternal circulation by placental over-production of renin (renin/angiotensinogen transgenic mice), and placental pathology (p57Kip2 mutant mice). These findings imply that the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia cannot be explained by a single mechanism. Therefore, segregation of the human disease into different subtypes may be a key first step in identifying genetic risk factors."

Obesity increases the risk to develop PE, presumably via the release of inflammatory mediators from the adipose tissue, but the exact etiology remains largely unknown. Using obese PE-like blood pressure high subline 5 (BPH/5) and lean gestational age-matched C57Bl6 mice, we aimed to obtain insight into differential reproductive white adipose tissue (rWAT) gene expression, circulating lipids and inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface during early pregnancy. In addition, we investigated the effect of 7 days 25% calorie restriction (CR) in early pregnancy on gene expression in rWAT and implantation sites. Compared with C57Bl6, female BPH/5 are dyslipidemic before pregnancy and show an amplification of rWAT mass, circulating cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triacylglycerol levels throughout pregnancy. RNA sequencing showed that pregnant BPH/5 mice have elevated gene enrichment in pathways related to inflammation and cholesterol biosynthesis at embryonic day (e) 7.5. Expression of cholesterol-related HMGCS1, MVD, Cyp51a1, and DHCR was validated by quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CR during the first 7 days of pregnancy restored the relative mRNA expression of these genes to a level comparable to C57Bl6 pregnant females and reduced the expression of circulating leptin and proinflammatory prostaglandin synthase 2 in both rWAT and implantation sites in BPH/5 mice at e7.5. Our data suggest a possible role for rWAT in the dyslipidemic state and inflammatory uterine milieu that might underlie the pathogenesis of PE. Future studies should further address the physiological functioning of the adipose tissue in relation to PE-related pregnancy outcomes."

In the trained group, mothers were placed in cages with access to a wheel before mating, and they remained within these throughout gestation. Blood pressure was measured by telemetry. We found that angiotensin II type I receptor was increased, whereas the Mas receptor was decreased in the placenta and the aorta of pregnant sedentary transgenic mice. This would produce a decrease in angiotensin-(1-7) effects in favor of angiotensin II. Supporting the functional contribution of this modulation, we found that the prevention of most pathological features in trained transgenic mice was associated with a normalization of placental angiotensin II type 1 and Mas receptors and an increase in aortic Mas receptor. We also found reduced circulating and placental soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 in trained transgenic mice compared with sedentary mice. This study demonstrates that modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is a key mechanism in the development of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, which can be altered by exercise training to prevent disease features in an animal model.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multisystemic disorder is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. This syndrome has been known to medical science since ancient times. However, despite considerable research, the cause/s of preeclampsia remain unclear, and there is no effective treatment. Development of an animal model that recapitulates this complex pregnancy-related disorder may help to expand our understanding and may hold great potential for the design and implementation of effective treatment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that the CBA/J x DBA/2 mouse model of recurrent miscarriage is also a model of immunologically-mediated preeclampsia (PE). DBA/J mated CBA/J females spontaneously develop many features of human PE (primigravidity, albuminuria, endotheliosis, increased sensitivity to angiotensin II and increased plasma leptin levels) that correlates with bad pregnancy outcomes. We previously reported that antagonism of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling by soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1) is involved in placental and fetal injury in CBA/J x DBA/2 mice. Using this animal model that recapitulates many of the features of preeclampsia in women, we found that pravastatin restores angiogenic balance, ameliorates glomerular injury, diminishes hypersensitivity to angiotensin II and protects pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We described a new mouse model of PE, were the relevant key features of human preeclampsia develop spontaneously. The CBA/J x DBA/2 model, that recapitulates this complex disorder, helped us identify pravastatin as a candidate therapy to prevent preeclampsia and its related complications. We recognize that these studies were conducted in mice and that clinical trials are needed to confirm its application to humans."

                "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a complex pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder which poses significant risks for both maternal and fetal health. Preeclampsia affects 5-8% of pregnancies in the United States, causing a significant public health and economic burden. Despite extensive research, the etiology and pathogenesis of preeclampsia remain elusive, but have been correlated with maternal conditions such as obesity. In recent decades, the incidence of preeclampsia increased along with the prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age. Maternal obesity has been shown to negatively affect pregnancy in almost all aspects. However, the precise mechanisms by which obesity influences preeclampsia are unclear. Ankyrin repeat and SOCS Box Containing protein 4 (ASB4) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can promote the degradation of a wide range of target proteins. ASB4-null mice display a full spectrum of preeclampsia-like phenotypes during pregnancy including hypertension, proteinuria, and decreased litter size. Furthermore, maternal obesity induced by a high-fat diet aggravates preeclampsia-like phenotypes in pregnant mice lacking ASB4. Variants in the ASB4 gene have been associated with obesity in humans, and a functional connection between the ASB4 gene and obesity has been established in mice. This review discusses the connections between preeclampsia, obesity, and ASB4."

Because hypertension is an important risk factor for preeclampsia, we investigated whether hypertensive mice that overexpress human renin and angiotensinogen develop superimposed preeclampsia. Given that the mechanisms underlying this disease are still poorly understood, animal models are of great use for elucidation. Blood pressure and proteinuria were measured by telemetry and ELISA, respectively. Heart function was evaluated by echocardiography, whereas pathological cardiac hypertrophy-related genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 plasma concentrations were quantitated by ELISA and placental expression by real-time PCR. Transgenic mice develop de novo proteinuria during gestation and marked blood pressure elevation, which are hallmarks of superimposed preeclampsia on chronic hypertension. Abnormal placentation present in these mothers produced a significant decrease in pup and placental weight and was associated with an increased placental expression of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1. We also found heightened circulating levels of this receptor, when adjusted for placental mass, as has been observed in women who suffer from preeclampsia. Cardiac hypertrophy could be observed in the transgenic mice and was exacerbated by gestation. As a result, heart function was significantly decreased, and markers of pathological hypertrophy were increased. Our data, thus, confirm the characterization of a new model of superimposed preeclampsia on chronic hypertension. Because chronically hypertensive women are at risk of developing the pathology, our model reflects a clinical reality and is, thus, an excellent tool to elucidate the molecular mechanisms triggering this disease."

                "abstract": "Recently we described a mouse model, BPH/5, that spontaneously develops the hallmark clinical features of preeclampsia. BPH/5 exhibit impaired placentation before the onset of hypertension and proteinuria, supporting a causal role for the placenta in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Here we tested the hypothesis that an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) early in pregnancy results in placental abnormalities leading to the maternal symptoms of preeclampsia. We further hypothesized that chronic antioxidant therapy would ameliorate both feto-placental abnormalities and maternal symptoms. ROS levels measured by dihydroethidium revealed significant increases in oxidative stress in BPH/5 placentas at midgestation compared with C57 controls. This increase in ROS was correlated with reduced expression and activity of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase in early and midgestation BPH/5 placentas. These abnormalities in placental oxidant factors occurred before the onset of maternal symptoms, suggesting a possible causal link between increased ROS and maternal and feto-placental pathology in this model. In support of this, chronic treatment of BPH/5 with the superoxide dismutase-mimetic Tempol throughout gestation significantly improved fetal growth and survival. Furthermore, Tempol ameliorated pregnancy-induced increases in blood pressure and proteinuria in BPH/5 mothers. We confirmed that Tempol radical was present in plasma, and it normalized ROS levels in all placental zones in BPH/5. These data for the first time demonstrate an important causative role for increased ROS in the placenta in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in a model that spontaneously develops the disease. The results also strongly suggest the potential utility of antioxidant therapy in treating preeclampsia."

We have described an inbred mouse strain, BPH/5, which spontaneously develops a PE-like syndrome including late-gestational hypertension, proteinuria, and poor feto-placental outcomes. Here we tested the hypothesis that an angiogenic imbalance during pregnancy in BPH/5 mice leads to the development of PE-like phenotypes in this model. Similar to clinical findings, plasma from pregnant BPH/5 showed reduced levels of free vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PGF) compared to C57BL/6 controls. This was paralleled by a marked decrease in VEGF protein and Pgf mRNA in BPH/5 placentae. Surprisingly, antagonism by the soluble form of the FLT1 receptor (sFLT1) did not appear to be the cause of this reduction, as sFLT1 levels were unchanged or even reduced in BPH/5 compared to controls. Adenoviral-mediated delivery of VEGF(121) (Ad-VEGF) via tail vein at embryonic day 7.5 normalized both the plasma-free VEGF levels in BPH/5 and restored the in vitro angiogenic capacity of serum from these mice. Ad-VEGF also reduced the incidence of fetal resorptions and prevented the late-gestational spike in blood pressure and proteinuria observed in BPH/5. These data underscore the importance of dysregulation of angiogenic factors in the pathogenesis of PE and suggest the potential utility of early proangiogenic therapies in treating this disease."

Women with elevated baseline blood pressure have an increased risk of this disorder. We hypothesized that BPH/5 mice, an inbred mouse strain with mildly elevated blood pressure, would develop a pregnancy-induced hypertensive syndrome. Nonpregnant female BPH/5 and C57BL/6 mice underwent thoracic aortic implantation of telemeters. After 7 days of recovery and 5 days of baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) recording, strain-matched timed matings were carried out. MAP was recorded continuously during pregnancy and for 1 week after birth. In separate mice in metabolic cages, urinary protein was tracked, followed by renal histological analysis. Before pregnancy, the BPH/5 strain had elevated baseline MAP compared with the C57BL/6 strain, but both strains had similar total urinary protein levels and renal histology. MAP remained stable in both groups during the first 2 weeks of pregnancy. However, at the start of the last trimester, MAP began to rise further in the BPH/5 mice; it rose to peak levels just before delivery and returned to prepregnancy levels by 2 days after delivery. This was accompanied by late-gestational proteinuria and progressive glomerulosclerosis. No changes were observed in the C57BL/6 group except for a small decrease in MAP at mid gestation. The BPH/5 group delivered significantly smaller litters despite normal numbers of fetuses early in gestation, and longitudinal ultrasound studies documented fetal demise before the onset of hypertension and renal disease. This is the first report of an animal model that spontaneously develops a syndrome that bears close resemblance to preeclampsia, and it should have an impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder."

                "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia affects 6-10% of pregnancies and is one of the primary causes of premature birth. It is widely accepted that inappropriate placental development, combined with environmental factors, plays a major role in disease pathogenesis. The p57(Kip2) mouse is the only mouse model of pre-eclampsia that recapitulates the full spectrum of symptoms of the human disease, including placental abnormalities, hypertension, proteinuria and premature labour. In addition, pregnant females expressing wild-type levels of p57(Kip2) develop pre-eclampsia when carrying fetuses that lack p57(Kip2) expression. This demonstrates that either the fetus or the placenta causes the disease. Here, taking advantage of the unique genetics of the p57(Kip2) mouse, we have used full genome expression profiling to define the placental aspect of the p57(Kip2) phenotype at a molecular level and to conduct an unbiased search for factors involved in pre-eclampsia pathogenesis. During this analysis, we found that although mutant embryos demonstrate altered placental architecture and have histological changes indicative of reduced utero-placental blood flow, the p57(Kip2) pregnant females do not demonstrate hypertension or renal pathology. This suggests a model in which placental abnormalities cause pre-eclampsia only given other environmental variables. On the basis of this model, we expect that misregulation of molecular factors, while not able to cause a full spectrum of disease symptoms in this context, still occurs in these p57(Kip2) mutant mice. Our studies suggest a role for environmental factors in the p57(Kip2) pre-eclampsia phenotype and have identified several candidates for pre-eclampsia predisposition in this model, including known regulators of blood pressure, inflammation and apoptosis."

                "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a prevalent and potentially devastating disorder of pregnancy. Characterized by a sudden spike in blood pressure and urinary protein levels, it is associated with significant obstetric complications. BPH/5 is an inbred mouse model of preeclampsia with borderline hypertension before pregnancy. BPH/5 mice develop hypertension, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction during late gestation (after E14.5). We hypothesized that BPH/5 mice might exhibit early feto-placental abnormalities before the onset of maternal disease. All placental cell lineages were present in BPH/5 mice. However, the fetal and placental weights were reduced, with abnormalities in all the placental zones observed starting early in gestation (E9.5-E12.5). The fractional area occupied by the junctional zone was significantly reduced at all gestational timepoints. Markedly fewer CDKN1C-stained trophoblasts were seen invading the proximal decidual zone, and this was accompanied by reductions in Cdkn1c gene expression. Trophoblast giant cell morphology and cytokeratin staining were not altered, although the mRNA levels of several giant cell-specific markers were significantly downregulated. The labyrinth layer displayed decreased branching morphogenesis of endothelial cells, with electron microscopy evidence of attenuated trophoblast layers. The maternal decidual arteries showed increased wall-to-lumen ratios with persistence of actin-positive smooth muscle cells. These changes translated into dramatically increased vascular resistance in the uterine arteries, as measured by pulse-wave Doppler. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that defects at the maternal-fetal interface are primary causal events in preeclampsia, and further suggest the BPH/5 model is important for investigations of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in preeclampsia."

Early angiogenic and inflammatory disturbances within the placenta are thought to underlie the development of the maternal PE syndrome and poor pregnancy outcomes. However, the exact etiology remains largely unknown. Here, we use the BPH/5 mouse model of PE to elucidate the way in which inflammation early in pregnancy contributes to abnormal expression of angiogenic factors at the maternal-fetal interface. We have previously described improvement in maternal hypertension and fetal growth restriction in this model after treatment with the anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) specific inhibitor celecoxib. To further characterize the mechanisms by which celecoxib improves poor pregnancy outcomes in BPH/5 mice, we determined expression of angiogenic factors and complement pathway components after celecoxib. In BPH/5 implantation sites there was increased hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 ( Hif1\u03b1), heme oxygenase-1 ( Ho-1), and stem cell factor ( Scf) mRNA concomitant with elevated prostaglandin synthase 2 ( Ptgs2), encoding Cox2, and elevated VEGF protein. Angiopoietin 1 ( Ang1), tunica interna endothelial cell kinase-2 receptor ( Tie2), complement factor 3 ( C3), and complement factor B ( CfB) were increased in midgestation BPH/5 placentae. Whereas BPH/5 expression levels of VEGF, Ang1, and Tie2 normalized after celecoxib, placental C3 and CfB mRNA remained unchanged. However, celecoxib did reduce the pregnancy-specific circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) rise in BPH/5 mice at midgestation. These data show that elevated Cox2 during implantation contributes to placental angiogenic factor imbalances in the BPH/5 mouse model of PE."

Because the only definitive treatment is delivery of the fetus and placenta, preeclampsia contributes to increased morbidity and mortality of both mother and fetus. The BPH/5 mouse model, which spontaneously develops a syndrome strikingly similar to preeclampsia, displays excessive inflammation and suppression of inflammation improves pregnancy outcomes. During early pregnancy, decidual macrophages play an important role in promoting maternal tolerance to fetal antigens and regulating tissue remodeling, two functions that are critical for normal placental development. BPH/5 pregnancies are characterized by abnormal placentation; therefore, we hypothesized that macrophage localization and/or function is altered during early pregnancy at the site of placental formation (the decidua) compared to C57BL/6 controls. At early gestation time points, before the onset of maternal hypertension or proteinuria, there was a reduction in the number of macrophages in BPH/5 decidua and a concomitant increase in activated T cells compared with C57BL/6. BPH/5 decidua also exhibited decreased expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory, inducible nitric oxide synthase. Together, these data suggest that a reduction in decidual macrophages during pregnancy is associated with immune activation in BPH/5 mice, inadequate placental development and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes in this model."

Long-term adverse outcomes may occur in offspring from preeclamptic pregnancies. Accordingly, sex-specific changes in pubertal development have been described in children from preeclamptic women, but the underlying mechanisms remain vastly unexplored. Features of PE are spontaneously recapitulated by the blood pressure high subline 5 (BPH/5) mouse model, including obesity and dyslipidemia in females before and throughout pregnancy, superimposed hypertension from late gestation to parturition and fetal growth restriction. A sexually dimorphic cardiometabolic phenotype has been described in BPH/5 offspring: while females are hyperphagic, hyperleptinemic, and overweight, with increased reproductive white adipose tissue (rWAT), males have similar food intake, serum leptin concentration, body weight and rWAT mass as controls. Herein, pubertal development and adiposity were further investigated in BPH/5 progeny. Precocious onset of puberty occurs in BPH/5 females, but not in male offspring. When reaching adulthood, the obese BPH/5 females display hypoestrogenism and hyperandrogenism. Kisspeptins, a family of peptides closely linked to reproduction and metabolism, have been previously shown to induce lipolysis and inhibit adipogenesis. Interestingly, expression of kisspeptins (Kiss1) and their cognate receptor (Kiss1r) in the adipose tissue seem to be modulated by the sex steroid hormone milieu. To further understand the metabolic-reproductive crosstalk in the BPH/5 offspring, Kiss1/Kiss1r expression in male and female rWAT were investigated. Downregulation of Kiss1/Kiss1r occurs in BPH/5 females when compared to males. Interestingly, dietary weight loss attenuated circulating testosterone concentration and rWAT Kiss1 downregulation in BPH/5 females. Altogether, the studies demonstrate reproductive abnormalities in offspring gestated in a PE-like uterus, which appear to be closely associated to the sexually dimorphic metabolic phenotype of the BPH/5 mouse model."

It is characterized by new onset hypertension during the second half of gestation and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity/mortality. Maternal obesity increases the risk of PE and is a key predictor of childhood obesity and potentially offspring cardiometabolic complications in a sex-dependent manner. The influence of the maternal obesogenic environment, with superimposed PE, on offspring development into adulthood is unknown. Obese BPH/5 mice spontaneously exhibit late-gestational hypertension, fetal demise and growth restriction, and excessive gestational weight gain. BPH/5 females have improved pregnancy outcomes when maternal weight loss via pair-feeding is imposed beginning at conception. We hypothesized that phenotypic differences between female and male BPH/5 offspring can be influenced by pair feeding BPH/5 dams during pregnancy. BPH/5 pair-fed dams have improved litter sizes and increased fetal body weights. BPH/5 offspring born to ad libitum dams have similar sex ratios, body weights, and fecal microbiome as well as increased blood pressure that is reduced in the dam pair-fed offspring. Both BPH/5 male and female offspring born to pair-fed dams have a reduction in adiposity and an altered gut microbiome, while only female offspring born to pair-fed dams have decreased circulating leptin and white adipose tissue inflammatory cytokines. These sexually dimorphic results suggest that reduction in the maternal obesogenic environment in early pregnancy may play a greater role in female BPH/5 sex-dependent cardiometabolic outcomes than males. Reprograming females may mitigate the transgenerational progression of cardiometabolic disease."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an attractive system for investigating the effect of preventative treatment because this disease is often preceded by a premalignant state (clonal hematopoiesis or myelodysplastic syndrome). In Npm1c/Dnmt3a mutant knock-in mice, a model of AML development, leukemia is preceded by a period of extended myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and self-renewal. We found that this self-renewal can be reversed by oral administration of a small molecule (VTP-50469) that targets the MLL1-Menin chromatin complex.

Knowledge of the mechanisms driving evolution from CH to overt malignancy has been hampered by a lack of in vivo models that orthogonally activate mutant alleles. Here, we develop independently regulatable mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) and nucleophosmin 1 (Npm1), observed in human CH and AML, respectively. We find Dnmt3a mutation expands hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (HSC/MPPs), modeling CH. Induction of mutant Npm1 after development of Dnmt3a-mutant CH causes progression to myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), and more aggressive MPD is observed with longer latency between mutations. MPDs uniformly progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following transplant, accompanied by a decrease in HSC/MPPs and an increase in myeloid-restricted progenitors, the latter of which propagate AML in tertiary recipient mice. At a molecular level, progression of CH to MPD is accompanied by selection for mutations activating Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling. Progression to AML is characterized by additional oncogenic signaling mutations (Ptpn11, Pik3r1, Flt3) and/or mutations in epigenetic regulators (Hdac1, Idh1, Arid1a).

Here, we use mice with inducible mutant alleles common in human CH (DNMT3AR882; mouse Dnmt3aR878H) and AML (NPM1c; mouse Npm1cA). We find that Dnmt3aR878H/+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but not multipotent progenitor cell (MPP) subsets, have reduced cytokine expression and proinflammatory transcriptional signatures and a functional competitive advantage over their wild-type counterparts. Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs are the most potent cell type transformed by Npm1cA, generating myeloid malignancies in which few additional cooperating somatic mutation events were detected. At a molecular level, Npm1cA, in cooperation with Dnmt3aR878H, acutely increased the accessibility of a distinct set of promoters in HSCs compared with MPP cells. These promoters were enriched for cell cycling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, stem cell signatures, and targets of transcription factors, including NFAT and the chromatin binding factor HMGB1, which have been implicated in human AML. These results demonstrate cooperativity between preexisting Dnmt3aR878H and Npm1cA at the chromatin level, where specific loci altered in accessibility by Npm1cA are dependent on cell context as well as Dnmt3a mutation status.

MI-3454 profoundly inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation in acute leukemia cells and primary patient samples with MLL1 translocations or NPM1 mutations. When applied as a single agent, MI-3454 induced complete remission or regression of leukemia in mouse models of MLL1-rearranged or NPM1-mutated leukemia, including patient-derived xenograft models, through downregulation of key genes involved in leukemogenesis. We also identified MEIS1 as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker of treatment response with MI-3454 in leukemia, and demonstrated that this compound is well tolerated and did not impair normal hematopoiesis in mice. Overall, this study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, profound activity of the menin-MLL1 inhibitor as a single agent in clinically relevant PDX models of leukemia. These data provide a strong rationale for clinical translation of MI-3454 or its analogs for leukemia patients with MLL1 rearrangements or NPM1 mutations."

                "abstract": "Mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) are common in acute myeloid leukemia and portend a poor prognosis; thus, new therapeutic strategies are needed. The likely mechanism by which DNMT3A loss contributes to leukemogenesis is altered DNA methylation and the attendant gene expression changes; however, our current understanding is incomplete. We observed that murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which Dnmt3a had been conditionally deleted markedly overexpress the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, Dot1l. We demonstrate that Dnmt3a(-/-) HSCs have increased H3K79 methylation relative to wild-type (WT) HSCs, with the greatest increases noted at DNA methylation canyons, which are regions highly enriched for genes dysregulated in leukemia and prone to DNA methylation loss with Dnmt3a deletion. These findings led us to explore DOT1L as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DNMT3A-mutant AML. We show that pharmacologic inhibition of DOT1L resulted in decreased expression of oncogenic canyon-associated genes and led to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and terminal differentiation in DNMT3A-mutant cell lines in vitro. We show in vivo efficacy of the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ5676 in a nude rat xenograft model of DNMT3A-mutant AML. DOT1L inhibition was also effective against primary patient DNMT3A-mutant AML samples, reducing colony-forming capacity (CFC) and inducing terminal differentiation in vitro. These studies suggest that DOT1L may play a critical role in DNMT3A-mutant leukemia. With pharmacologic inhibitors of DOT1L already in clinical trials, DOT1L could be an immediately actionable therapeutic target for the treatment of this poor prognosis disease."

N-terminal CEBPA mutations cause ablation of full-length C/EBP\u03b1 without affecting the expression of a shorter oncogenic isoform, termed p30. The mechanistic basis of p30-induced leukemogenesis is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the MLL1 histone-methyltransferase complex represents a critical actionable vulnerability in CEBPA-mutated AML. Oncogenic C/EBP\u03b1 p30 and MLL1 show global co-localization on chromatin and p30 exhibits robust physical interaction with the MLL1 complex. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of MLL1 results in proliferation arrest and myeloid differentiation in C/EBP\u03b1 p30-expressing cells. In line, CEBPA-mutated hematopoietic progenitor cells are hypersensitive to pharmacological targeting of the MLL1 complex. Inhibitor treatment impairs proliferation and restores myeloid differentiation potential in mouse and human AML cells with CEBPA mutations. Finally, we identify the transcription factor GATA2 as a direct critical target of the p30-MLL1 interaction. Altogether, we show that C/EBP\u03b1 p30 requires the MLL1 complex to regulate oncogenic gene expression and that CEBPA-mutated AML is hypersensitive to perturbation of the MLL1 complex. These findings identify the MLL1 complex as a potential therapeutic target in AML with CEBPA mutations."

                "abstract": "The acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) genome contains more than 20 driver recurrent mutations. Here, we review the potential for therapeutic targeting of the most common mutations associated with normal cytogenetics AML, focusing on those affecting the FLT3, NPM1 and epigenetic modifier genes (DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2). As compared to early compounds, second generation FLT3 inhibitors are more specific and have better pharmacokinetics. They also show higher anti-leukaemic activity, leading to about 50% of composite complete remissions in refractory/relapsed FLT3-internal tandem duplication-mutated AML. However, rapid relapses invariably occur due to various mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. This issue and the best way for using FLT3 inhibitors in combination with other therapeutic modalities are discussed. Potential approaches for therapeutic targeting of NPM1-mutated AML include: (i) reverting the aberrant nuclear export of NPM1 mutant using exportin-1 inhibitors; (ii) disruption of the nucleolus with drugs blocking the oligomerization of wild-type nucleophosmin or inducing nucleolar stress; and (iii) immunotherapeutic targeting of highly expressed CD33 and IL3RA (CD123) antigens. Finally, we discuss the role of demethylating agents (decitabine and azacitidine) and IDH1/2 inhibitors in the treatment of AML patients carrying mutations of genes (DNMT3A, IDH1/2 and TET2) involved in the epigenetic regulation of transcription.

Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance. "

One third of mice developed delayed-onset AML, suggesting a requirement for cooperating mutations.

We determined that a regulator of Dnmts, miR-29b, is downregulated in bone marrow of dKI AML mice. Bortezomib exerted a dose-dependent increase in miR-29b expression in AML blasts ex vivo, followed by decreased Dnmts, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis. In vivo, bortezomib was not active against dKI AML, yet liposomal-encapsulated bortezomib, as a single agent, reversed downregulation of miR-29b in vivo and induced a long-term (90-day) disease-free remission in 80% of dKI AML mice that exhibited high leukemic burden at the start of therapy, yet showed no signs of relapse at autopsy. Taken together, these data support that liposomal bortezomib, as a single agent, eradicates Mll(PTD/wt):Flt3(ITD/wt) AML in mouse and may represent a powerful and potentially curative approach to high-risk human disease.

Recurrent somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), most frequently at arginine 882 (DNMT3AR882), have been observed in AML and in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis in the absence of leukemic transformation. Patients with DNMT3AR882 AML have an inferior outcome when treated with standard-dose daunorubicin-based induction chemotherapy, suggesting that DNMT3AR882 cells persist and drive relapse. We found that Dnmt3a mutations induced hematopoietic stem cell expansion, cooperated with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (Flt3ITD) and the nucleophosmin gene (Npm1c) to induce AML in vivo, and promoted resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. In patients with AML, the presence of DNMT3AR882 mutations predicts minimal residual disease, underscoring their role in AML chemoresistance. DNMT3AR882 cells showed impaired nucleosome eviction and chromatin remodeling in response to anthracycline treatment, which resulted from attenuated recruitment of histone chaperone SPT-16 following anthracycline exposure. This defect led to an inability to sense and repair DNA torsional stress, which resulted in increased mutagenesis. Our findings identify a crucial role for DNMT3AR882 mutations in driving AML chemoresistance and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy."

Thus, small molecule inhibitors targeting menin-MLL fusion protein interaction have been emerging for the treatment of MLL-rearranged AML. As both inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and menin-MLL interaction target the transcription-regulatory machinery involving epigenetic regulation of chromatin remodeling that governs the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that these two classes of agents might interact to kill MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML cells. Here, we report that the combination treatment with subtoxic doses of the HDAC inhibitor chidamide and the menin-MLL interaction inhibitor MI-3 displayed a highly synergistic anti-tumor activity against human MLL-r AML cells in vitro and in vivo, but not those without this genetic aberration. Mechanistically, co-exposure to chidamide and MI-3 led to robust apoptosis in MLL-r AML cells, in association with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and a sharp increase in ROS generation. Combined treatment also disrupted DNA damage checkpoint at the level of CHK1 and CHK2 kinases, rather than their upstream kinases (ATR and ATM), as well as DNA repair likely via homologous recombination (HR), but not non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Genome-wide RNAseq revealed gene expression alterations involving several potential signaling pathways (e.g., cell cycle, DNA repair, MAPK, NF-\u03baB) that might account for or contribute to the mechanisms of action underlying anti-leukemia activity of chidamide and MI-3 as a single agent and particularly in combination in MLL-r AML. Collectively, these findings provide a preclinical basis for further clinical investigation of this novel targeted strategy combining HDAC and Menin-MLL interaction inhibitors to improve therapeutic outcomes in a subset of patients with poor-prognostic MLL-r leukemia."

In KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) and NPM1-mutant (NPM1c) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, JNJ-75276617 inhibited the association of the menin-KMT2A complex with chromatin at target gene promoters, resulting in reduced expression of several menin-KMT2A target genes, including MEIS1 and FLT3. JNJ-75276617 displayed potent antiproliferative activity across several AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and patient samples harboring KMT2A or NPM1 alterations in\u00a0vitro. In xenograft models of AML and ALL, JNJ-75276617 reduced leukemic burden and provided a significant dose-dependent survival benefit accompanied by expression changes of menin-KMT2A target genes. JNJ-75276617 demonstrated synergistic effects with gilteritinib in\u00a0vitro in AML cells harboring KMT2A-r. JNJ-75276617 further exhibited synergistic effects with venetoclax and azacitidine in AML cells bearing KMT2A-r in\u00a0vitro, and significantly increased survival in mice. Interestingly, JNJ-75276617 showed potent antiproliferative activity in cell lines engineered with recently discovered mutations (MEN1M327I or MEN1T349M) that developed in patients refractory to the menin-KMT2A inhibitor revumenib. A cocrystal structure of menin in complex with JNJ-75276617 indicates a unique binding mode distinct from other menin-KMT2A inhibitors, including revumenib. JNJ-75276617 is being clinically investigated for acute leukemias harboring KMT2A or NPM1 alterations, as a monotherapy for relapsed/refractory acute leukemia (NCT04811560), or in combination with AML-directed therapies (NCT05453903)."

However, the combined function of CBF\u03b2-SMMHC and cooperating mutations in preleukemic expansion is not known. Here, we used Nras(LSL-G12D); Cbfb(56M) knock-in mice to show that allelic expression of oncogenic Nras(G12D) and Cbf\u03b2-SMMHC increases survival of preleukemic short-term HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells and maintains the differentiation block induced by the fusion protein. Nras(G12D) and Cbf\u03b2-SMMHC synergize to induce leukemia in mice in a cell-autonomous manner, with a shorter median latency and higher leukemia-initiating cell activity than that of mice expressing Cbf\u03b2-SMMHC.

Around half of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) express high levels of HOXA cluster genes and MEIS1. Most of these AML cases harbor an NPM1 mutation (NPM1c), which encodes for an oncoprotein mislocalized from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. How NPM1c expression in hematopoietic cells leads to its characteristic gene-expression pattern remains unclear. Here, we show that NPM1c directly binds to specific chromatin targets, which are co-occupied by the histone methyltransferase KMT2A (MLL1). Targeted degradation of NPM1c leads to a rapid decrease in gene expression and loss of RNA polymerase II, as well as activating histone modifications at its targets. We demonstrate that NPM1c directly regulates oncogenic gene expression in collaboration with the MLL1 complex and define the mechanism by which MLL1-Menin small-molecule inhibitors produce clinical responses in patients with NPM1-mutated AML. SIGNIFICANCE: We uncovered an important functional role of mutant NPM1 as a crucial direct driver of oncogenic gene expression in AML. NPM1c can bind to chromatin and cooperate with the MLL complex, providing the first functional insight into the mechanism of Menin-MLL inhibition in NPM1c leukemias.

Combining menin-MLL inhibition with specific small-molecule kinase inhibitors of FLT3 phosphorylation resulted in a significantly superior reduction of phosphorylated FLT3 and transcriptional suppression of genes downstream of FLT3 signaling. The drug combination induced synergistic inhibition of proliferation, as well as enhanced apoptosis, compared with single-drug treatment in models of human and murine NPM1mut and MLL-r leukemias harboring an FLT3 mutation. Primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells harvested from patients with NPM1mutFLT3mut AML showed significantly better responses to combined menin and FLT3 inhibition than to single-drug or vehicle control treatment, whereas AML cells with wild-type NPM1, MLL, and FLT3 were not affected by either of the 2 drugs. In vivo treatment of leukemic animals with MLL-r FLT3mut leukemia reduced leukemia burden significantly and prolonged survival compared with results in the single-drug and vehicle control groups.

We propose that serial acquisition of mutations occurs in self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We investigated this model through genomic analysis of HSCs from six patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations present in individual AML patients harboring the FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutation. We then screened the residual HSCs and detected some of these mutations including mutations in the NPM1, TET2, and SMC1A genes. Finally, through single-cell analysis, we determined that a clonal progression of multiple mutations occurred in the HSCs of some AML patients. These preleukemic HSCs suggest the clonal evolution of AML genomes from founder mutations, revealing a potential mechanism contributing to relapse. Such preleukemic HSCs may constitute a cellular reservoir that should be targeted therapeutically for more durable remissions."

There are a number of reasons for this, but key among them is the considerable heterogeneity of this disease and the paucity of molecular markers that can be used to predict clinical outcomes and responsiveness to different therapies. The recent large-scale sequencing of AML genomes is now providing opportunities for patient stratification and personalized approaches to treatment that are based on individual mutational profiles. It is particularly notable that studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas and others have determined that 44% of patients with AML exhibit mutations in genes that regulate methylation of genomic DNA. In particular, frequent mutation has been observed in the genes encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), as well as Tet oncogene family member 2. This review will summarize the incidence of these mutations, their impact on biochemical functions including epigenetic modification of genomic DNA and their potential usefulness as prognostic indicators. Importantly, the presence of DNMT3A, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations may confer sensitivity to novel therapeutic approaches, including the use of demethylating agents. Therefore, the clinical experience with decitabine and azacitidine in the treatment of patients harboring these mutations will be reviewed. Overall, we propose that understanding the role of these mutations in AML biology will lead to more rational therapeutic approaches targeting molecularly defined subtypes of the disease. "

Pharmacologic small-molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL1 protein interaction had profound antileukemic activity in human and murine models of NPM1mut AML. Combined pharmacologic inhibition of menin-MLL1 and DOT1L resulted in dramatic suppression of HOX and FLT3 expression, induction of differentiation, and superior activity against NPM1mut leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: MLL1 and DOT1L are chromatin regulators that control HOX, MEIS1, and FLT3 expression and are therapeutic targets in NPM1mut AML. Combinatorial small-molecule inhibition has synergistic on-target activity and constitutes a novel therapeutic concept for this common AML subtype.

            "abstract": "Advances in genetics and sequencing have identified a plethora of disease-associated and disease-causing genetic alterations. To determine causality between genetics and disease, accurate models for molecular dissection are required; however, the rapid expansion of transcriptional populations identified through single-cell analyses\u00a0presents a major challenge for accurate comparisons between mutant and wild-type cells. Here we generate mouse models of human severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) using patient-derived mutations in the GFI1 transcription factor. To determine the effects of SCN mutations, we generated single-cell references for granulopoietic genomic states with linked epitopes1, aligned mutant cells to their wild-type equivalents and identified differentially expressed genes and epigenetic loci. We find that GFI1-target genes are altered sequentially, as cells go through successive states of differentiation. These insights facilitated the genetic rescue of granulocytic specification but not post-commitment defects in innate\u00a0immune effector function, and underscore the importance of evaluating the effects of mutations and therapy within each relevant cell state."

                "abstract": "Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterized by a deficiency of mature neutrophils, leading to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Although mutations in Elastase-2, neutrophil (ELA2) predominate in human SCN, mutation of Ela2 in mice does not recapitulate SCN. The growth factor independent-1 (GFI1) transcription factor regulates ELA2. Mutations in GFI1 are associated with human SCN, and genetic deletion of Gfi1 results in murine neutropenia. We examined whether human SCN-associated GFI1N382S mutant proteins are causal in SCN and found that GFI1 functions as a rate-limiting granulopoietic molecular switch. The N382S mutation inhibited GFI1 DNA binding and resulted in a dominant-negative block to murine granulopoiesis. Moreover, Gfi1N382S selectively derepressed the monopoietic cytokine CSF1 and its receptor. Gfi1N382S-expressing Csf1-/- cells formed neutrophils. These results reveal a common transcriptional program that underlies both human and murine myelopoiesis, and that is central to the pathogenesis of SCN associated with mutations in GFI1. This shared transcriptional pathway may provide new avenues for understanding SCN caused by mutations in other genes and for clinical intervention into human neutropenias."

                "abstract": "The DNA-binding zinc finger transcription factors Gfi1 and Gfi1b were discovered more than 20 years ago and are recognized today as major regulators of both early hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells. Both proteins function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes to promoters and enhancers of target genes. The establishment of Gfi1 and Gfi1b reporter mice made it possible to visualize their cell type-specific expression and to understand their function in hematopoietic lineages. We now know that Gfi1 is primarily important in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, whereas Gfi1b is crucial for the generation of red blood cells and platelets. Several rare hematologic diseases are associated with acquired or inheritable mutations in the GFI1 and GFI1B genes. Certain patients with severe congenital neutropenia carry mutations in the GFI1 gene that lead to the disruption of the C-terminal zinc finger domains. Other mutations have been found in the GFI1B gene in families with inherited bleeding disorders. In addition, the Gfi1 locus is frequently found to be a proviral integration site in retrovirus-induced lymphomagenesis, and new, emerging data suggest a role of Gfi1 in human leukemia and lymphoma, underlining the role of both factors not only in normal hematopoiesis, but also in a wide spectrum of human blood diseases.

                "abstract": "Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterised by a differentiation block in the bone marrow and low neutrophil numbers in the peripheral blood, which correlates with increased risk of bacterial infections. Several underlying gene defects have been identified in SCN patients. Mutations in the neutrophil elastase (ELANE) gene are frequently found in SCN and cyclic neutropenia. Both mislocalization and misfolding of mutant neutrophil elastase protein resulting in ER stress and subsequent induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) have been proposed to be responsible for neutrophil survival and maturation defects. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms still remain unclear, in part due to the lack of appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. Here we used a system of neutrophil differentiation from immortalised progenitor lines by conditional expression of Hoxb8, permitting the generation of mature near-primary neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. NE-deficient Hoxb8 progenitors were reconstituted with murine and human forms of typical NE mutants representative of SCN and cyclic neutropenia, and differentiation of the cells was analysed in vitro and in vivo. ER stress induction by NE mutations could be recapitulated during neutrophil differentiation in all NE mutant-reconstituted Hoxb8 cells. Despite ER stress induction, no change in survival, maturation or function of differentiating cells expressing either murine or human NE mutants was observed. Further analysis of in vivo differentiation of Hoxb8 cells in a murine model of adoptive transfer did not reveal any defects in survival or differentiation in the mouse. Although the Hoxb8 system has been found to be useful for dissection of defects in neutrophil development, our findings indicate that the use of murine systems for analysis of NE-mutation-associated pathogenesis is complicated by differences between humans and mice in the physiology of granulopoiesis, which may go beyond possible differences in expression and activity of neutrophil elastase itself."

Genetic evaluation of other forms of neutropenia in humans and model organisms has helped to illuminate the role of NE. A canine form of cyclic neutropenia corresponds to human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2) and results from mutations in AP3B1 encoding a subunit of a complex involved in the subcellular trafficking of vesicular cargo proteins (among which NE appears to be one). Rare cases of SCN are attributable to mutations in the transcriptional repressor Gfi1 (among whose regulatory targets also include ELA2). The ultimate biochemical consequences of the mutations are not yet known, however. Gene targeting of ELA2 has thus far failed to recapitulate neutropenia in mice. The cycling phenomenon and origins of leukemic transformation in SCN remain puzzling. Nevertheless, mutations in all 3 genes are capable of causing the mislocalization of NE and may also induce the unfolded protein response, suggesting that there might a convergent pathogenic mechanism focusing on NE."

Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with SCN and cyclic neutropenia, a related disorder characterized by periodic oscillations in the number of circulating neutrophils, have heterozygous germline mutations in the ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase (NE). To test the hypothesis that these mutations are causative for SCN, we generated transgenic mice carrying a targeted mutation of their Ela2 gene (\"V72M\") reproducing a mutation found in 2 unrelated patients with SCN, one of whom developed AML. Expression of mutant NE mRNA and enzymatically active protein was confirmed. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for the V72M allele have normal numbers of circulating neutrophils, and no accumulation of myeloid precursors in the bone marrow was observed. Serial blood analysis found no evidence of cycling in any of the major hematopoietic lineages. Rates of apoptosis following cytokine deprivation were similar in wild-type and mutant neutrophils, as were the frequency and cytokine responsiveness of myeloid progenitors. The stress granulopoiesis response, as measured by neutrophil recovery after cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression, was normal. To define the leukemogenic potential of V72M NE, a tumor watch was established. To date, no cases of leukemia have been detected. Collectively, these data suggest that expression of V72M NE is not sufficient to induce an SCN phenotype or leukemia in mice."

These mice, called Genista, had normal viability and no weight loss, in contrast to mice expressing null alleles of the Gfi1 gene. Furthermore, the Genista mutation had a very limited impact on lymphopoiesis or on T- and B-cell function. Within the bone marrow (BM), the Genista mutation resulted in a slight increase of monopoiesis and in a block of terminal granulopoiesis. This block occurred just after the metamyelocytic stage and resulted in the generation of small numbers of atypical CD11b(+) Ly-6G(int)  neutrophils, the nuclear morphology of which resembled that of mature WT neutrophils. Unexpectedly, once released from the BM, these atypical neutrophils contributed to induce mild forms of autoantibody-induced arthritis and of immune complex-mediated lung alveolitis. They additionally failed to provide resistance to acute bacterial infection. Our study demonstrates that a hypomorphic mutation in the Gfi1 transcriptional repressor results in a novel form of neutropenia characterized by a split pattern of functional responses, reflecting the distinct thresholds required for eliciting neutrophil-mediated inflammatory and anti-infectious responses."

Mutations of the ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase (NE) are responsible for most cases of SCN and cyclic neutropenia (CN), a related but milder disorder of granulopoiesis. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations disrupt granulopoiesis are unclear. We hypothesize that the ELA2 mutations result in the production of misfolded NE protein, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and ultimately apoptosis of granulocytic precursors. Expression of mutant NE but not wild-type NE strongly induced BiP/GRP78 mRNA expression and XBP1 mRNA splicing, 2 classic markers of the UPR. The magnitude of UPR activation by a specific ELA2 mutation correlated with its associated clinical phenotype. Consistent with the UPR model, expression of mutant NE in primary human granulocytic precursors increased expression of CHOP (DDITS) and induced apoptosis in a protease-independent fashion. Most strikingly, UPR activation and decreased NE protein expression were detected in primary granulocytic precursors from SCN patients. Collectively, these data provide strong support for a UPR model of SCN disease pathogenesis and place SCN in a growing list of human diseases caused by misfolded proteins."

RECENT FINDINGS: Congenital neutropenia comprise monogenetic entities with or without additional immunologic and extrahaematopoietic syndromatic features. Continuous careful explorations of known entities such as ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3 deficiency and XLN help to define principles controlling differentiation and function of neutrophil granulocytes. Furthermore, the identification of novel genetic defects associated with congenital neutropenia, such as VPS45 deficiency, broadens our understanding of neutrophil biology. Pathogenic mechanisms imply protein and vesicle mistrafficking, endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response, destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, disturbed energy metabolism, dysglycosylation and deregulated actin polymerization. SUMMARY: Advanced genetic and biochemical techniques have helped to expand our knowledge of congenital neutropenia syndromes. Known and novel genetic entities shed light on fundamental biological processes important for the homeostatis and functioning not only of the neutrophil granulocyte but as well of the entire haematopoietic system. Furthermore, treatment decisions become more tailored and might pave the road towards personalized molecular medicine."

                "abstract": "In approximately 20% of cases of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), mutations are found in the gene encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R). These mutations introduce premature stop codons, which result in truncation of 82-98 COOH-terminal amino acids of the receptor. SCN patients who develop secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia almost invariably acquired a GCSFR mutation, suggesting that this genetic alteration represents a key step in leukemogenesis. Here we show that an equivalent mutation targeted in mice (gcsfr-Delta715) results in the selective expansion of the G-CSF- responsive progenitor (G-CFC) compartment in the bone marrow. In addition, in vivo treatment of gcsfr-Delta715 mice with G-CSF results in increased production of neutrophils leading to a sustained neutrophilia. This hyperproliferative response to G-CSF is accompanied by prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) complexes and extended cell surface expression of mutant receptors due to defective internalization. In view of the continuous G-CSF treatment of SCN patients, these data provide insight into why progenitor cells expressing truncated receptors clonally expand in vivo, and why these cells may be targets for additional genetic events leading to leukemia."

Mice carrying a targeted mutation of their G-CSFR that reproduces the mutation found in a patient with SCN and AML have been generated. The mutant G-CSFR allele is expressed in a myeloid-specific fashion at levels comparable to the wild-type allele. Mice heterozygous or homozygous for this mutation have normal levels of circulating neutrophils and no evidence for a block in myeloid maturation, indicating that resting granulopoiesis is normal. However, in response to G-CSF treatment, these mice demonstrate a significantly greater fold increase in the level of circulating neutrophils. This effect appears to be due to increased neutrophil production as the absolute number of G-CSF-responsive progenitors in the bone marrow and their proliferation in response to G-CSF is increased. Furthermore, the in vitro survival and G-CSF-dependent suppression of apoptosis of mutant neutrophils are normal. Despite this evidence for a hyperproliferative response to G-CSF, no cases of AML have been detected to date. These data demonstrate that the G-CSFR mutation found in patients with SCN is not sufficient to induce an SCN phenotype or AML in mice."

Previous studies identified two zebrafish CSF3 ligands and a single CSF3 receptor. Transient antisense morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of both these ligands and receptor reduces neutrophil numbers in zebrafish embryos, a technique widely used to evaluate neutrophil contributions to models of infection, inflammation and regeneration. We created an allelic series of zebrafish csf3r mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis targeting csf3r exon 2. Biallelic csf3r mutant embryos are viable and have normal early survival, despite a substantial reduction of their neutrophil population size, and normal macrophage abundance. Heterozygotes have a haploinsufficiency phenotype with an intermediate reduction in neutrophil numbers. csf3r mutants are viable as adults, with a 50% reduction in tissue neutrophil density and a substantial reduction in the number of myeloid cells in the kidney marrow. These csf3r mutants are a new animal model of human CSF3R-dependent congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, they will be valuable for studying the impact of neutrophil loss in the context of other zebrafish disease models by providing a genetically stable, persistent, reproducible neutrophil deficiency state throughout life."

Dissection of this phenotype showed that mature neutrophils were required both in the BM and in the periphery for proper NK cell development. In mice lacking neutrophils, NK cells displayed hyperproliferation and poor survival and were blocked at an immature stage associated with hyporesponsiveness. The role of neutrophils as key regulators of NK cell functions was confirmed in patients with severe congenital neutropenia and autoimmune neutropenia. In addition to their direct antimicrobial activity, mature neutrophils are thus endowed with immunoregulatory functions that are conserved across species. These findings reveal novel types of cooperation between cells of the innate immune system and prompt examination of NK cell functional deficiency in patients suffering from neutropenia-associated diseases."

It is now well-established that mutations in HAX1 and ELANE (and more rarely in other genes) are the genetic cause of SCN. In contrast, it has remained unclear how these mutations affect neutrophil development. Innovative models based on induced pluripotent stem cell technology are being explored to address this issue. These days, most SCN patients receive life-long treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, CSF3). CSF3 therapy has greatly improved the life expectancy of SCN patients, but also unveiled a high frequency of progression toward myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and therapy refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expansion of hematopoietic clones with acquired mutations in the gene encoding the G-CSF receptor (CSF3R) is regularly seen in SCN patients and AML usually descends from one of these CSF3R mutant clones. These findings raised the questions how CSF3R mutations affect CSF3 responses of myeloid progenitors, how they contribute to the pre-leukemic state of SCN, and which additional events are responsible for progression to leukemia. The vast (sub)clonal heterogeneity of AML and the presence of AML-associated mutations in normally aged hematopoietic clones make it often difficult to determine which mutations are responsible for the leukemic process. Leukemia predisposition syndromes such as SCN are unique disease models to identify the sequential acquisition of these mutations and to interrogate how they contribute to clonal selection and leukemic evolution.

Rarely, SCN can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1 or activating mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene, respectively. More recently, a complex disorder associating SCN and developmental aberrations was identified, caused by mutations in the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3) gene.

Molecular basis of several congenital neutropenia has been recently determined, involving gene coding for the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA2), GFI1, WAS protein and mitochondrial HAX1 protein. These mutations, dominant (ELA2, GFI1), X-linked (WAS) and autosomal recessive (HAX1), result in instability of the contents of the granules- particularly the neutrophil elastase- or in abnormalities of the cytoskeleton, and possibly, in an increased apoptosis. ELA2 mutations resulting both in profound and permanent neutropenia, and in cyclic--pseudo sinusoidal--neutropenia lead to consider that time pattern is very close in the two apparently distinct phenotypes. This observation suggests that temporal variations of neutrophils could be represented by non linear functions. Congenital neutropenia, specifically ELA2 mutated, are also characterized by a high rate of leukemia (about 15% at 20 years of age). Leukemia risk does not appear to be related to an oncogenic effect of ELA2 mutations, but much likely to the deepness of the neutropenia, and the intensity of G-CSF therapy."

                "abstract": "Elucidating the mechanisms determining multipotent progenitor cell fate remains a fundamental project of contemporary biology. Various tissues of mice and men with defects in the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor Gfi1 have dramatic perturbations in the proportions of their differentiated cell types. In Gfi1-deficient intestinal epithelium there is a shift from mucous and Paneth towards enteroendocrine cells, leading to the proposal that Gfi1 functions in the allocation of the progeny derived from a hypothetical common granulocytic progenitor. However, studies of clones have yielded no evidence of such a common progenitor prompting us to investigate alternate mechanisms explaining the Gfi1-deficient phenotype. We report that mucous and Paneth but not enteroendocrine lineage cells normally express Gfi1. Sporadic mucous and Paneth lineage cells in the crypts of Gfi1-deficient mice aberrantly express the pro-enteroendocrine transcription factor Neurog3, indicating that stable repression of Neurog3 in these lineages requires Gfi1. Importantly, we also find mucous and Paneth lineage cells in various stages of cellular reprogramming into the enteroendocrine lineage in Gfi1-deficient mice. We propose that mucous and Paneth cell lineage metastability, rather than reallocation at the level of a hypothetical common granulocytic progenitor, is responsible for the shifts in cell type proportions observed in Gfi1-deficient intestinal epithelium."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) or Kostmann syndrome was originally reported to be an autosomal recessive disease of neutrophil production causing recurrent, life-threatening infections. Mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA-2) have previously been identified in patients with sporadic or autosomal dominant SCN. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 14 individuals (four patients with SCN and ten close relatives) belonging to the original Kostmann family in northern Sweden for mutations in the ELA-2 and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor genes. RESULTS: One patient belonging to the original Kostmann family harbored a novel heterozygous ELA-2 mutation (g.2310T-->A;Leu92His) that was not inherited from her parents. The mutation was identified in DNA isolated from both whole blood and skin fibroblasts, suggesting a sporadic de novo mutation. As a young adult this patient sequentially acquired two mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) and therefore recently received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, due to the risk of evolution to leukemia. Moreover, another patient developed acute leukemia and was treated with transplantation. No pathogenic ELA-2 or G-CSFR gene mutations were found in this patient or the other two patients, nor in any healthy relative. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data are the first to document leukemia evolution and G-CSFR gene mutations in the original Kostmann kindred. In addition, our findings indicate that ELA-2 mutations are not the primary cause of SCN in the Swedish Kostmann family."

            "abstract": "\u03b2-thalassemia, an autosomal recessive blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin, is majorly caused by the point mutation of the HBB gene resulting in reduced or absent \u03b2-globin chains of the hemoglobin tetramer. Animal models recapitulating both the phenotype and genotype of human disease are valuable in the exploration of pathophysiology and for in\u00a0vivo evaluation of novel therapeutic treatments. The docile temperament, short vital cycles, and low cost of rabbits make them an attractive animal model. However, \u03b2-thalassemia rabbit models are currently unavailable. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we point mutated the rabbit \u03b2-globin gene HBB2 with high efficiency and generated a \u03b2-thalassemia rabbit model. Hematological and histological analyses demonstrated that the genotypic mosaic F0 displayed a mild phenotype of anemia, and the heterozygous F1 exhibited typical characteristics of \u03b2-thalassemia. Whole-blood transcriptome analysis revealed that the gene expression was altered in HBB2-targeted when compared with WT rabbits. And the highly expressed genes in HBB2-targeted rabbits were enriched in lipid and iron metabolism, innate immunity, and hematopoietic processes. In conclusion, using CRISPR-mediated HBB2 knockout, we have created a \u03b2-thalassemia rabbit model that accurately recapitulates the human disease phenotype. We believe this tool will be valuable in advancing the investigation of pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets of \u03b2-thalassemia and associated complications."

The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the somatic cells of patients in combination with subsequent homologous recombination-based gene correction provides new approaches to cure this disease. CRISPR/Cas9 is a genome editing tool that is creating a buzz in the scientific community for treating human diseases, especially genetic disorders. Here, we reported that correction of \u03b2-thalassemia mutations in patient-specific iPSCs using the CRISPR/Cas9 tool promotes hematopoietic differentiation in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9-corrected iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were injected into sublethally-irradiated NOD-scid-IL2Rg-/- (NSI) mice. HBB expression was observed in these HSCs after hematopoietic differentiation in the NSI mice. Importantly, no tumor was found in the livers, lungs, kidneys, or bone marrow at 10 weeks in the NSI mice after implantation with these HSCs. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 successfully corrects \u03b2-thalassemia mutations in patient-specific iPSCs. These CRISPR/Cas9-corrected iPSC-derived HSCs express normal HBB in mice without tumorigenic potential, suggesting a safe strategy for personalized treatment of \u03b2-thalassemia."

When \u03b2-globin chains are absent or limiting, free \u03b1-globins precipitate and damage cell membranes, causing hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Clinical data show that severity of \u03b2-thal correlates with the number of inherited \u03b1-globin genes (HBA1 and HBA2), with \u03b1-globin gene deletions having a beneficial effect for patients. Here, we describe a novel strategy to treat \u03b2-thal based on genome editing of the \u03b1-globin locus in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using CRISPR/Cas9, we combined 2 therapeutic approaches: (1) \u03b1-globin downregulation, by deleting the HBA2 gene to recreate an \u03b1-thalassemia trait, and (2) \u03b2-globin expression, by targeted integration of a \u03b2-globin transgene downstream the HBA2 promoter. First, we optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and corrected the pathological phenotype in a cellular model of \u03b2-thalassemia (human erythroid progenitor cell [HUDEP-2] \u03b20). Then, we edited healthy donor HSPCs and demonstrated that they maintained long-term repopulation capacity and multipotency in xenotransplanted mice. To assess the clinical potential of this approach, we next edited \u03b2-thal HSPCs and achieved correction of \u03b1/\u03b2 globin imbalance in HSPC-derived erythroblasts. As a safer option for clinical translation, we performed editing in HSPCs using Cas9 nickase showing precise editing with no InDels. Overall, we described an innovative CRISPR/Cas9 approach to improve \u03b1/\u03b2 globin imbalance in thalassemic HSPCs, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies for \u03b2-thal."

The aim of this study was the production of an in vitro model of \u03b2-thalassemia using the highly efficient CRISPR-Cas9 system. Embryonic stem (ES) cells were nucleofected with guide RNA (gRNA)-Cas9 expression vectors. Molecular testing was done on extracted DNA to assess Hbb-b1 mutation. Analysis of transcription factors and hemoglobin genes were evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction following erythroid differentiation of ES cells. Sequencing data confirmed Hbb-b1 knockout alleles. Significant expression of erythroid transcription factors was observed in wild-type, Hbb-b1+/- and Hbb-b1-/- groups (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

Considering the need for in vitro and mouse models to investigate the molecular basis of \u03b2-thalassemia which also enables testing of therapeutic approaches, this method can be utilized to produce a mouse model of \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia (Hbbth1/th1)."

Due to the low efficiency of typical homologous recombination, endonucleases, including TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9, have been widely used to enhance the gene correction efficiency in patient-derived iPSCs. Here, we designed TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 to directly target the intron2 mutation site IVS2-654 in the globin gene. We observed different frequencies of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at IVS2-654 loci using TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9, and TALENs mediated a higher homologous gene targeting efficiency compared to CRISPR/Cas9 when combined with the piggyBac transposon donor. In addition, more obvious off-target events were observed for CRISPR/Cas9 compared to TALENs. Finally, TALENs-corrected iPSC clones were selected for erythroblast differentiation using the OP9 co-culture system and detected relatively higher transcription of HBB than the uncorrected cells. This comparison of using TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 to correct specific HBB mutations in patient-derived iPSCs will guide future applications of TALENs- or CRISPR/Cas9-based gene therapies in monogenic diseases.

                "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia is one of the most common recessive genetic diseases, caused by mutations in the HBB gene. Over 200 different types of mutations in the HBB gene containing three exons have been identified in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia (\u03b2-thal) whereas a homozygous mutation in exon 1 causes sickle cell disease (SCD). Novel therapeutic strategies to permanently correct the HBB mutation in stem cells that are able to expand and differentiate into erythrocytes producing corrected HBB proteins are highly desirable. Genome editing aided by CRISPR/Cas9 and other site-specific engineered nucleases offers promise to precisely correct a genetic mutation in the native genome without alterations in other parts of the human genome. Although making a sequence-specific nuclease to enhance correction of a specific HBB mutation by homology-directed repair (HDR) is becoming straightforward, targeting various HBB mutations of \u03b2-thal is still challenging because individual guide RNA as well as a donor DNA template for HDR of each type of HBB gene mutation have to be selected and validated. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two \u03b2-thal patients with different HBB gene mutations, we devised and tested a universal strategy to achieve targeted insertion of the HBB cDNA in exon 1 of HBB gene using Cas9 and two validated guide RNAs. We observed that HBB protein production was restored in erythrocytes derived from iPSCs of two patients. This strategy of restoring functional HBB gene expression will be able to correct most types of HBB gene mutations in \u03b2-thal and SCD. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:87-97."

Individuals with compound heterozygous \u03b2-thalassemia or SCD and HPFH have milder clinical symptoms. So, HbF reactivation has long been sought as an approach to mitigate the clinical symptoms of \u03b2-thalassemia and SCD.

In our study, deletion of 200bp of BCL11A erythroid enhancer including GATAA motif leads to strong induction of \u03b3-hemoglobin expression in K562\u202fcells, but not in KU-812 and KG-1\u202fcells. Altogether, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 as a precision genome editing tool for treating \u03b2-thalassemia.

Three CRISPR/Cas9 cassettes were provided, whose single-guide RNAs targeted different regions in the SOX6 gene-binding domain.

Our results show that mutation induction in the binding site of the SOX6 gene leads to \u03b3-globin reactivation. These findings support the idea that CRISPR interrupts the SOX6 binding site, and, as a result, SOX6 is incapable of binding the \u03b3-globin promoter.

Because models involving erythroid differentiation of CD34+ cells have limitations in assessing \u03b3-globin reactivation, we focused on human \u03b2-globin locus-transgenic (\u03b2-YAC) mice. We used a helper-dependent human CD46-targeting adenovirus vector expressing CRISPR/Cas9 (HDAd-HBG-CRISPR) to disrupt a repressor binding region within the \u03b3-globin promoter. We transduced HSPCs from \u03b2-YAC/human CD46-transgenic mice ex vivo and subsequently transplanted them into irradiated recipients. Furthermore, we used an in vivo HSPC transduction approach that involves HSPC mobilization and the intravenous injection of HDAd-HBG-CRISPR into \u03b2-YAC/CD46-transgenic mice. In both models, we demonstrated efficient target site disruption, resulting in a pronounced switch from human \u03b2- to \u03b3-globin expression in red blood cells of adult mice that was maintained after secondary transplantation of HSPCs. In long-term follow-up studies, we did not detect hematological abnormalities, indicating that HBG promoter editing does not negatively affect hematopoiesis. This is the first study that shows successful in vivo HSPC genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9."

Disruption of just the putative HbF silencer results in a mild increase in \u03b3-globin expression, whereas deletion or inversion of a 13.6-kb region causes a robust reactivation of HbF synthesis in adult erythroblasts that is associated with epigenetic modifications and changes in chromatin contacts within the \u03b2-globin locus. In primary SCD patient-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, targeting the 13.6-kb region results in a high proportion of \u03b3-globin expression in erythroblasts, increased HbF synthesis, and amelioration of the sickling cell phenotype. Overall, this study provides clues for a potential CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach to the therapy of \u03b2-hemoglobinopathies."

Bone marrow transplantation for curing \u03b2-thalassaemia is limited due to the lack of matched donors. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), as a widely used tool for gene editing, is able to target specific sequence and create double-strand break (DSB), which can be combined with the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) to correct mutations. In this study, according to two different strategies, the HBB IVS2-654 mutation was seamlessly corrected in iPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN. To reduce the occurrence of secondary cleavage, a more efficient strategy was adopted. The corrected iPSCs kept pluripotency and genome stability. Moreover, they could differentiate normally. Through CRISPR/Cas9 system and ssODN, our study provides improved strategies for gene correction of \u03b2-Thalassaemia, and the expression of the HBB gene can be restored, which can be used for gene therapy in the future."

Novel therapeutic approaches are based on lentiviral vectors (LVs) or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption to express adult hemoglobin (HbA), or to reactivate the completely functional fetal hemoglobin, respectively. Nonetheless, LVs present a risk of insertional mutagenesis, while gene-disrupting transcription factors (BCL11A, KLF1) involved in the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch might generate dysregulation of other cellular processes. Therefore, universal gene addition/correction approaches combining CRISPR-Cas9 and homology directed repair (HDR) by delivering a DNA repair template through adeno-associated virus could mitigate the limitations of both lentiviral gene transfer and gene disruption strategies, ensuring targeted integration and controlled transgene expression. In this study, we attained high rates of gene addition (up to 12%) and gene correction (up to 38%) in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from healthy donors without any cell sorting/enrichment or the application of HDR enhancers.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by decreased hemoglobin production. Severe anemia can damage organs and severe threat to life safety. Allogeneic transplantation of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) at present represents a promising therapeutic approach for thalassemia. However, immune rejection and lack of HLA-matched donors limited its clinical application. In recent years, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) technology offers prospects for autologous cell-based therapy since it could avoid the immunological problems mentioned above. METHODS: In the present study, we established a new hiPSCs line derived from amniotic cells of a fetus with a homozygous \u03b241-42 (TCTT) deletion mutation in the HBB gene and a heterozygous Westmead mutation (C\u2009>\u2009G) in the HBA2 gene. We designed a CRISPR-Cas9 to target these casual mutations and corrected them. Gene-corrected off-target analysis was performed by whole-exome capture sequencing. The corrected hiPSCs were analyzed by teratoma formation and erythroblasts differentiation assays. RESULTS: These mutations were corrected with linearized donor DNA through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair. Corrections of hiPSCs were validated by sequences. The corrected hiPSCs retain normal pluripotency. Moreover, they could be differentiated into hematopoietic progenitors, which proves that they maintain the multilineage differentiation potential. CONCLUSIONS: We designed sgRNAs and demonstrated that these sgRNAs facilitating the CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing system could be applied to correct concurrent \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia in patient-derived hiPSCs. In the future, these corrected hiPSCs can be applied for autologous transplantation in patients with concurrent \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia."

                "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genome editing provide a precise way to generate gene-corrected cells for disease modeling and cell therapies. Human iPSCs generated from sickle cell disease (SCD) patients have a homozygous missense point mutation in the HBB gene encoding adult \u03b2-globin proteins, and are used as a model system to improve strategies of human gene therapy. We demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system designer nuclease is much more efficient in stimulating gene targeting of the endogenous HBB locus near the SCD point mutation in human iPSCs than zinc finger nucleases and TALENs. Using a specific guide RNA and Cas9, we readily corrected one allele of the SCD HBB gene in human iPSCs by homologous recombination with a donor DNA template containing the wild-type HBB DNA and a selection cassette that was subsequently removed to avoid possible interference of HBB transcription and translation. We chose targeted iPSC clones that have one corrected and one disrupted SCD allele for erythroid differentiation assays, using an improved xeno-free and feeder-free culture condition we recently established. Erythrocytes from either the corrected or its parental (uncorrected) iPSC line were generated with similar efficiencies. Currently \u223c6%-10% of these differentiated erythrocytes indeed lacked nuclei, characteristic of further matured erythrocytes called reticulocytes. We also detected the 16-kDa \u03b2-globin protein expressed from the corrected HBB allele in the erythrocytes differentiated from genome-edited iPSCs. Our results represent a significant step toward the clinical applications of genome editing using patient-derived iPSCs to generate disease-free cells for cell and gene therapies.

The efficiency of targeting deletion reached 31% in cells with the delivery of both upstream and downstream breakpoint guide RNA (gRNA)-guided Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 nuclease (SaCas9). The erythroid colonies differentiated from HSPCs with HPFH deletion showed significantly higher \u03b3-globin gene expression compared with the colonies without deletion. By T7 endonuclease 1 assay, we did not detect any off-target effects in the colonies with deletion.

Animal models of lymphedema are used to test pharmacologic and microsurgical therapies; however, no animal model for HNL is described in the literature to date. In this study we describe the first reproducible rat model for HNL. Animals were subjected to two surgical protocols: (1) lymphadenectomy plus irradiation; and (2) sham surgery and no irradiation. Head and neck expansion was measured on post-operative days 15, 30 and 60. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired at the same time points. Lymphatic drainage was measured at day 60 via indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography, after which animals were sacrificed for histological analysis. Postsurgical lymphedema was observed 100% of the time. Compared to sham-operated animals, lymphadenectomy animals experienced significantly more head and neck swelling at all timepoints (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Lymphadenectomy animals had significantly slower lymphatic drainage for 6 days post-ICG injection (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Histological analysis of lymphadenectomy animals revealed 83% greater subcutis thickness (P\u2009=\u20090.008), 22% greater collagen deposition (P\u2009=\u20090.001), 110% greater TGF\u03b21+ cell density (P\u2009=\u20090.04), 1.7-fold increase in TGF\u03b21 mRNA expression (P\u2009=\u20090.03), and 114% greater T-cell infiltration (P\u2009=\u20090.005) compared to sham-operated animals. In conclusion, animals subjected to complete lymph node dissection and irradiation developed changes consistent with human clinical postsurgical HNL. This was evidenced by significant increase in all head and neck measurements, slower lymphatic drainage, subcutaneous tissue expansion, increased fibrosis, and increased inflammation compared to sham-operated animals."

Previous studies have reported that exercise is beneficial to relieve LE, but the changes in the lymphatic system following exercise are still unclear. This study aimed to examine the changes in lymphatic drainage pathways over the exercise period and beneficial effects of exercise in rats with LE. Twelve rats were randomly allocated into exercise and control groups (EG and CG; n = 6 each). To obtain LE, inguinal and popliteal LND followed by 20 Gy irradiation was performed. Treadmill exercise was 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week over the four-week period. Consecutive indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography images were collected and classified into five patterns: i) linear; ii) splash; iii) stardust; iv) diffuse, and v) none. Ankle thickness was measured weekly. Histopathological evaluation was performed to examine the skin thickness, collagen area fraction (%) and lymphatic vessel density in harvested tissue. ICG lymphography exhibited more linear and splash patterns in the EG at week 3. The difference of swelling between both groups was significantly different at week 4 (p = 0.016). Histopathologic data revealed a thinner epidermis (p = 0.041) and dermis (p = 0.002), lower collagen area fraction (%, p = 0.002), and higher lymph vessel density (p = 0.002) in the EG than the CG. In conclusion, we found that postoperative exercise can facilitate improvement in lymphatic fluid retention in the lymphedema rat model, resulting in improvement of pathological conditions in the lymphatic system."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) in small animals is a promising but challenging tool in preclinical lymphatic research. In this study, we compared the gadolinium (Gd)-based nanoparticle AGuIX with Gd-DOTA for interstitial MRL in healthy rats and in a chronic rat hindlimb lymphedema model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative study with AGuIX and Gd-DOTA for interstitial MRL was performed in healthy Lewis rats (n = 6). For this purpose, 75 \u03bcL of 3 mM AGuIX (containing 30 mM Gd-DOTA side residues) and 75 \u03bcL 30 mM Gd-DOTA were injected simultaneously in the right and left hindlimbs. Repetitive high-resolution, 3-dimensional time-of-flight gradient recalled echo MRL sequences were acquired over a period of 90 minutes using a 9.4 T animal scanner. Gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography and surgical dissection after methylene blue injection served as supportive imaging techniques. In a subsequent proof-of-principle study, AGuIX-based MRL was investigated in a hindlimb model of chronic lymphedema (n = 4). Lymphedema of the right hindlimbs was induced by means of popliteal and inguinal lymphadenectomy and irradiation with 20 Gy. The nonoperated left hindlimbs served as intraindividual controls. Six, 10, and 14 weeks after lymphadenectomy, MRL investigations were performed to objectify lymphatic reorganization. Finally, skin samples of the lymphedematous and the contralateral control hindlimbs were analyzed by means of histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: AGuIX-based MRL resulted in high-resolution anatomical depiction of the rodent hindlimb lymphatic system. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the popliteal lymph node were increased directly after injection and remained significantly elevated for up to 90 minutes after application. AGuIX provided significantly higher and prolonged signal intensity enhancement as compared with Gd-DOTA. Furthermore, AGuIX-based MRL demonstrated lymphatic regeneration in the histopathologically verified chronic lymphedema model. Collateral lymphatic vessels were detectable 6 weeks after lymphadenectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that AGuIX is a suitable contrast agent for preclinical interstitial MRL in rodents. AGuIX yields anatomical imaging of lymphatic vessels with diameters greater than 200 \u03bcm. Moreover, it resides in the lymphatic system for a prolonged time. AGuIX may therefore facilitate high-resolution MRL-based analyses of the lymphatic system in rodents."

However, research of lymphedema treatments, such as vascularized lymph node transfer, is limited by the absence of an adequate lymphedema animal model. The purpose of this study was to determine if we could create sustainable lower limb lymphedema in the rat with a combination of inguinal lymphadenectomy, circumferential skin and subcutaneous tissue excision, and radiotherapy. METHODS: Inguinal lymphadenectomies were completed in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. In cohort A, 5 rats received a 0.5- to 1.0-cm wide excision of proximal thigh skin and subcutaneous tissue. This step was omitted for the 10 rats in cohort B. Cohort A then received a single radiation dose of 22.7 Gy, whereas cohort B received a cumulative dose of 40.5 Gy. Bioimpedance measurements were obtained monthly to assess lymphedema progression, and lymphatic drainage at 6 months postradiation was visualized via indocyanine green (ICG) lymphangiography. RESULTS: Two rats in cohort A developed visually appreciable lymphedema in the lower limb, with bioimpedance ratios of 0.684 and 0.542 and ankle circumference ratios of 1.294 and 1.061, respectively, consistent with lymphedema. Furthermore, ICG lymphangiography in these cohort A rats revealed impaired lower limb lymphatic drainage. In cohort B, however, bioimpedance and circumference ratios, and ICG lymphangiography, did not reveal abnormal lymphatic drainage. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of inguinal lymphadenectomy, circumferential skin and subcutaneous tissue excision, and radiotherapy can successfully create lower limb lymphedema in the rat. When soft tissue excision is omitted, lymphedema does not develop."

There is an urgent need for innovative approaches to restore continuous lymph flow in affected tissues. To this end, the efficacy of a subcutaneously implanted draining device in reducing lymphoedema volume in a rat hindlimb lymphoedema model was tested. METHODS: A rat model of chronic lymphoedema was developed by surgical removal of popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes, followed by irradiation. The model was characterised by monitoring limb volume via tape measure, skin water content via dielectric constant measurement, and lymphatic drainage via lymphofluoroscopy. After lymphoedema establishment in 16 Wistar rats, a device made of fenestrated tubing equipped with a miniaturised pumping system, was implanted subcutaneously in the affected limb to restore continuous recirculation of interstitial fluid. RESULTS: Lymphofluoroscopy imaging showed impaired lymphatic drainage following lymphadenectomy and irradiation. Affected limb volume and skin water content increased significantly compared with the untreated limb, with a median (interquartile range) of 3.85 (0.38) cm3 versus 3.03 (0.43) cm3 for volume (n\u00a0=\u00a016, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and 26.6 (9.1) versus 16.6 (3.7) cm3 for skin dielectric constant (n\u00a0=\u00a016, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001). Treatment of lymphoedema with the implanted drainage device showed that 5 weeks post-implant excess volume was significantly reduced by 51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018% compared with the pre-implant situation (n\u00a0=\u00a09 sham group, n\u00a0=\u00a07 pump group). CONCLUSION: Lymphoedema volume in the rat model was significantly reduced by restoring continuous drainage of excess fluid using a novel subcutaneously implanted device, opening the way to the development of an artificial lymphatic vessel."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although lymphedematous skin exhibits delayed wound healing, little is known about lymph drainage during wound healing. We investigated the wound healing process in the presence of lymphatic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The right inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) and the surrounding tissue were excised in each mouse (the operation side), and a sham operation was performed in the left hindlimb (the control side). The next day, full-thickness wounds were made on both hindlimbs. The right hindlimb exhibited acute edema until day 3; however, it started to improve after day 4, and the wound area and epithelialization ratio were similar on both sides. Indocyanine green (ICG) was injected into both hindlimbs to observe lymph flow. On the operation side, ICG leaked out of the surgical site or remained at the injection site until day 2. Some lymph flow toward the existing lymph vessels was seen on day 3, and on day 10, lymph flow toward the axial LNs was detected on the operation side in all mice. On the operation side, the number of dermal lymph vessels was significantly increased on days 3 and 15. The dermal lymph vessel area of the peripheral wound was significantly smaller on the operation side. CONCLUSIONS: In a hindlimb lymphedema mouse model, lymph transiently accumulated in subcutaneous tissue, and then was gradually absorbed by the existing lymph vessels. The increase in the number of lymph vessels contributes to lymph drainage during wound healing. Acute lymphedema because of transient lymphatic dysfunction has little effect on wound healing."

To provide mechanistic insight into the delayed and rapid secondary lymphedema initiation, we compared the ability of the ALND-recovered rat foreleg lymphatic system to prevent edema during an inflammatory challenge with that of the uninjured lymphatic system. At 73 days postsurgery, the forelegs of ALND(-)- and ALND(+)-sensitized rats were exposed to the proinflammatory agent oxazolone, which was found to reduce fluid drainage and increase skin thickness in both ALND(-) and ALND(+) forelegs (P < 0.05). However, drainage in the ALND-recovered forelegs was more severely impaired than ALND(-) forelegs, as visualized by indocyanine green lymphography and quantified by interstitial transport of fluid marker (P < 0.05). Although both ALND(+) and ALND(-) forelegs experienced significant inflammation-induced edema with the oxazolone exposure (P < 0.05), the peak tissue swelling in the ALND(+) group was significantly greater than that of the ALND(-) forelegs (arm area peaked at \u223c13.4 vs. \u223c5.7% swelling, respectively, P < 0.005; wrist diameter peaked at 9.7 vs. 2.2% swelling, respectively, P < 0.005). The findings demonstrate that outward recovery from ALND in the rat foreleg masks an ensuing chronic and latent lymphatic insufficiency, which reduces the ability of the foreleg lymphatic system to prevent edema during an acute inflammatory process."

Our purpose was to develop a reliable lymphedema model mimicking the clinical scenario and allows a microsurgical approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Lewis rats weighing 400 to 450\u2009g were used to create lymphedema with groin and popliteal lymph node dissection and creation of 5\u2009mm circumferential skin defect (n\u00a0=\u00a06). A skin incision was made and closed primarily for control group (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Evaluation included indocyanine green (ICG) lymphangiography 1 and 2\u00a0months postoperatively, volume difference between bilateral hindlimbs measured using micro-CT, and the skin was harvested for histological evaluation 2\u00a0months postoperatively. RESULTS: Larger volume differences present in the lymphedema group (17.50\u2009\u00b1\u20097.76 vs. 3.73\u2009\u00b1\u20092.66%, p\u2009<\u2009.05). ICG lymphangiography indicated dermal backflow only in the lymphedema group. Increased thickness of the epidermis was noted in lymphedema group (28.50\u2009\u00b1\u200912.61\u2009\u03bcm vs. 15.10\u2009\u00b1\u20095.41\u2009\u03bcm, p\u2009<\u2009.0001).

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our objective was to develop an animal model of postsurgical lymphedema that would permit quantitation of edema and lymphatic function after the removal of a single popliteal lymph node in sheep. METHODS: As a measure of lymph transport, (125)I-human serum albumin was injected into prenodal vessels at 8, 12 and 16 weeks after nodal excision, and plasma levels of the protein tracer were used to calculate the transport rate of the tracer to blood (percent injected per hour). Edema was quantified from the circumferential measurement of the hind limbs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Following nodal excision, the limbs became progressively more edematous up to 3 days after nodectomy. After this, the swelling decreased but had not resolved even at 16 weeks after surgery. Compared with control limbs (17.2 +/- 0.6; n = 7), lymphatic function was depressed at 8 weeks after surgery (10.6 +/- 1.5; n = 7). At 12 (14.4 +/- 1.0; n = 7) and 16 weeks (13.9 +/- 1.0; n = 6), regeneration of lymphatic vessels at the excision site helped to restore about 80% of lymphatic capacity. These techniques may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology associated with cancer-related postsurgical lymphedema and may facilitate the development of new strategies to treat or prevent this condition."

                "abstract": "A reliable, inexpensive experimental counterpart of peripheral lymphedema has been notoriously difficult to reproduce thereby stifling basic and clinical research into this frustrating clinical condition. Accordingly, in 45 adult Wistar-Fuzzy rats, we attempted to produce sustained hindlimb lymphedema by either groin nodal/lymphatic microsurgical ablation (S) (guided by visual blue dye lymphography) or limited field-groin irradiation (R) alone (4500 rads) or combined S followed by R or R followed by S with an additional non-manipulated group serving as controls. Observations were made for 30-100 days thereafter. Hindlimb volumes were determined serially using the truncated cone formula based on multiple circumferential measurements at standardized intervals along the affected hindlimb and the findings compared with similar measurements in the contralateral non-manipulated hindlimb. In randomly selected rats from each group, lymphatic drainage was assessed by lymphangioscintigraphy (LAS), soft tissue swelling by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and edema fluid total protein content by refractometry. Whereas S or R alone produced only transient or mild hindlimb edema without associated morbidity or mortality, S-R or R-S induced moderate to severe sustained protein-rich hindlimb lymphedema associated with 9-13% early mortality and notable late local limb morbidity. Lymphatic obstruction was documented by sustained maintenance of increased hindlimb volume, subcutaneous fluid accumulation (MRI), and impaired lymphatic drainage (LAS). This reproducible rodent model of secondary lymphedema reliably simulates a stable clinical condition for a window of up to 100 days and should thereby facilitate standardized testing of therapeutic/preventive protocols and basic research into lymphatic dynamics in secondary lymphedema."

                "abstract": "The treatment of lymphedema by medical or surgical means remains a difficult task, and no technique is presently satisfactory. We established a rabbit ear chronic lymphedema model in which sequential lymph node fragments were transplanted to restore lymphatic pathways. Twenty New Zealand White rabbits were divided into two groups of 10 animals. One group served as the control, and the other was the transplantation group. A 3-cm-wide strip of skin and subcutaneous tissue including all the lymphatics was excised circumferentially from the root part of the right ear in each rabbit. The vascular pedicle in the control group was wrapped with a \"bridge\" strip of skin from the ventral ear to protect it from drying. In the transplantation group, the auricular lymph node was harvested from the contralateral ear, cut into 1- to 2-mm slices, and implanted next to the vascular pedicle where the lymph vessels had been resected. Water displacement measurements in both groups revealed significant edema (p < 0.001) compared with the contralateral ear at 3 days. Peak swelling was observed at 10 days in both groups. Volumes decreased in both groups postoperatively. The volume measured as percentage change in the lymph node transplantation group was significantly lower than in the control group at 2 months and continuing to the end of the experiment (p < 0.001). Indirect lymphographic examination revealed that the distal lymphatic vessels of the control group were increased in number, dilated, and did not allow proximal passage of dye. Light microscopy revealed the vascular pedicle to be surrounded by dense scar tissue in the \"bridge.\" The transplantation group showed free passage of dye through the bridge. Microscopic examination showed regenerated lymphoid tissue with sinuses along the artery and vein of the \"bridge.\" Many channels with a layer of endothelial cells were also noted. Electron microscopy confirmed these sites to be regenerated lymph vessels. Lymphatic tissue can regenerate after fragment transplantation. This lymph tissue seems to regenerate lymphatic vessels that may function for drainage. The results suggest that this simple technique may be applicable in a clinical situation to prevent or treat obstructive lymphedema."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer-related lymphedema affects more than 400,000 survivors in the United States. In 2009, lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach (LYMPHA) was first described as a surgical technique to prevent lymphedema by bypassing divided arm lymphatics into adjacent veins at the time of an axillary lymph node dissection. We describe the first animal model of LYMPHA. METHODS: In Yorkshire pigs, each distal hind limb lymphatic system was cannulated and injected with a different fluorophore (human serum albumin-conjugated indocyanine green or Evans Blue). Fluorescence-assisted resection and exploration imaging system was used to map the respective lymphangiosomes to the groin. Baseline lymphatic clearance of each hind limb lymphangiosome was obtained by measuring the fluorescence of each dye from centrally obtained blood samples. A lymphadenectomy versus lymphadenectomy with LYMPHA was then performed. The injections were then repeated to obtain clearance rates that were compared against baseline values. RESULTS: Human serum albumin-conjugated indocyanine green and Evans Blue allowed for precise lymphatic mapping of each respective hind limb using fluorescence-assisted resection and exploration imaging. Lymphatic clearance from the distal hind limb dropped 68% when comparing baseline clearance versus after a groin lymphadenectomy. In comparison, lymphatic clearance dropped only 21% when comparing baseline clearance versus a lymphadenectomy with LYMPHA. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first animal model for LYMPHA, which will enable future studies to further evaluate the efficacy and potential limitations of this technique. Of equal importance, we demonstrate the power of optical imaging to provide real-time lymphatic clearance rates for each hind limb."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previously, we have shown that 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) stimulates lymphangiogenesis and limits postsurgical lymphedema in animal models when administered via daily intraperitoneal injections. In this study, we investigate whether a single-use depot 9-cis RA drug delivery system (DDS) implanted at the site of lymphatic injury can mitigate the development of lymphedema in a clinically relevant mouse limb model. METHODS: Hind limb lymphedema was induced via surgical lymphadenectomy and irradiation. Animals were divided into two treatment groups: (1) 9-cis RA DDS, (2) placebo DDS. Outcomes measured included paw thickness, lymphatic clearance and density, epidermal thickness, and collagen deposition. RESULTS: Compared with control animals, 9-cis RA-treated animals had significantly less paw swelling from postoperative week 3 (P\u2009=\u2009.04) until the final timepoint at week 6 (P\u2009=\u2009.0007). Moreover, 9-cis RA-treated animals had significantly faster lymphatic clearance (P\u2009<\u2009.05), increased lymphatic density (P\u2009=\u2009.04), reduced lymphatic vessel size (P\u2009=\u2009.02), reduced epidermal hyperplasia (P\u2009=\u2009.04), and reduced collagen staining (P\u2009=\u2009.10). CONCLUSIONS: Animals receiving 9-cis RA sustained-release implants at the time of surgery had improved lymphatic function and structure, indicating reduced lymphedema progression. Thus, we demonstrate that 9-cis RA contained within a single-use depot DDS has favorable properties in limiting pathologic responses to lymphatic injury and may be an effective strategy against secondary lymphedema."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) on postsurgical lymphedema. BACKGROUND: 9-cis RA promotes lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and has promise as a therapeutic agent to limit the development of postsurgical lymphedema. METHODS: Lymphedema was induced in the right hind limb after a single fraction of 20\u200aGy radiation, popliteal lymphadenectomy, and lymphatic vessel ablation. Postoperatively, mice were randomly divided in to 2 groups that received daily intraperitoneal injections of either (1) an oil-based vehicle solution (control) or (2) 0.08\u200amg/kg of 9-cis RA dissolved in a vehicle solution. Outcome measures included paw thickness, lymphatic drainage, and lymphatic vessel density as measured by podoplanin immunohistochemistry and whole mount skin analysis. RESULTS: Using our combined injury protocol, postsurgical lymphedema was observed 89% of the time. 9-cis RA-treated animals had less early postsurgical edema and significantly less paw lymphedema compared with vehicle-treated animals at all time-points (P < 0.001). 9-cis RA-treated animals had significantly faster lymphatic drainage as measured by indocyanine green clearance and increased lymphatic vessel density as measured by podoplanin immunohistochemistry (P < 0.001) and whole mount skin analysis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a highly reproducible model of secondary lymphedema and have demonstrated that 9-cis RA significantly prevents postsurgical lymphedema. Treatment with 9-cis RA is associated with increased lymphatic clearance and lymphangiogenesis. Because 9-cis RA (alitretinoin) is already approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration for other conditions, it has the potential to be repurposed as a preventative agent for postsurgical lymphedema in humans."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of secondary lymphedema remains poorly understood. This study aimed to establish a consistent mouse hindlimb lymphedema model for further investigation of the mechanism and treatment of lymphedema. METHODS: The authors developed a novel postsurgical lymphedema model in the mouse hindlimb by modifying previously described methods. Lymphedema in the hindlimb was created by removing both the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes together with the surrounding fat pads, followed by silicone splint placement in the inguinal region. Using this modified mouse model, the authors analyzed lymphatic function, histologic changes, and the expression of lymphangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor C at various time points. RESULTS: The splinted lymphedema model showed a significant increase of edema formation in the hindlimb compared with the sham surgery control animals. Indocyanine green lymphography revealed lymphatic drainage impairment shown by dermal backflow and rerouting of lymph flow in the lymphedema model. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical examinations showed a significant increase of skin thickness and abnormally dilated lymphatics in the lymphedema model. The expression of lymphangiogenic factors in lymphedematous tissues of the splinted lymphedema model was significantly increased compared with controls, depending on the degree of lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: This splinted lymphedema model closely simulates the volume response, histopathology, and lymphography characteristics of human acquired lymphedema. Given these similarities to human lymphedema, this refinement of a mouse hindlimb model of acquired lymphedema represents a promising platform for the study of lymphatic vascular insufficiency and for the evaluation of new therapeutic modalities."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this prospective series were to present our results in 106 sequential cases of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the head and neck region and contrast the experience in oral cancer with that for cutaneous lesions. HYPOTHESES: SLNB has an acceptably low complication rate in the head and neck. Lymphatic mapping and gamma probe-guided lymphadenectomy can improve the management of malignancies of the head and neck by more accurate identification of the nodal basins at risk and more accurate staging of the lymphatics. For appropriately selected patients, radionuclide lymphatic mapping may safely allow for minimally invasive sentinel lymphadenectomy without formal completion selective lymphadenectomy. METHODS: One hundred six patients underwent intralesional radionuclide injection and radiologic lymphoscintigraphy (LS) on Institutional Review Board-approved protocols and 103 of these underwent successful SLNB. These included 35 patients with malignant melanoma, 10 cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, four lip cancers, eight Merkel cell carcinomas, two rare cutaneous lesions, and 43 oral cancers. Mean follow up was 24 months. Patients with oral cavity malignancy underwent concurrent selective neck dissection after narrow-exposure sentinel lymph node excision. In this group, the SLNB histopathology could be correlated with the completion neck specimen histopathology. Patients with cutaneous malignancy underwent SLNB alone and only received regional lymphadenectomy based on positive histology or clinical indications. Data were tabulated for anatomic drainage patterns, complications, histopathology, and patterns of cancer recurrence. RESULTS: Surgical complications were rare. No temporary or permanent dysfunction of facial or spinal accessory nerves occurred with sentinel node biopsy. Lymphatic drainage to areas dramatically outside of the expected lymphatic basins occurred in 13.6%. Predictive value of a negative sentinel node was 98.2% for cutaneous malignancies (based on regional recurrence) and 92% with oral cancer (based on pathologic correlation). Gross tumor replacement of lymph nodes and redirection of lymphatic flow represented a significant technical issue in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Sixteen percent of patients with oral cancer were upstaged from N0 to N1 after extended sectioning and immunohistochemistry of the sentinel node. CONCLUSIONS: LS and SLNB can be performed with technical success in the head and neck region. Complications are minimal. More accurate staging and mapping of lymphatic drainage may improve the quality of standard lymphadenectomy. The potential for minimally invasive surgery based on this technology exists, but there is a small risk of missing positive disease. Whether the failure rate is greater than that of standard lymphadenectomy without gamma probe guidance is not known. New studies need to focus on refinements of technique and validation of accuracy as well as biologic correlates for the prediction of metastases."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the redirection of lymphatic drainage post-lymphadenectomy using non-invasive near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, and to subsequently assess impact on metastasis. BACKGROUND: Cancer-acquired lymphedema arises from dysfunctional fluid transport after lymphadenectomy performed for staging and to disrupt drainage pathways for regional control of disease. However, little is known about the normal regenerative processes of the lymphatics in response to lymphadenectomy and how these responses can be accelerated, delayed, or can impact metastasis. METHODS: Changes in lymphatic \"pumping\" function and drainage patterns were non-invasively and longitudinally imaged using NIRF lymphatic imaging after popliteal lymphadenectomy in mice. In a cohort of mice, B16F10 melanoma was inoculated on the dorsal aspect of the paw 27 days after lymphadenectomy to assess how drainage patterns affect metastasis. RESULTS: NIRF imaging demonstrates that, although lymphatic function and drainage patterns change significantly in early response to popliteal lymph node (PLN) removal in mice, these changes are transient and regress dramatically due to a high regenerative capacity of the lymphatics and co-opting of collateral lymphatic pathways around the site of obstruction. Metastases followed the pattern of collateral pathways and could be detected proximal to the site of lymphadenectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Both lymphatic vessel regeneration and co-opting of contralateral vessels occur following lymphadenectomy, with contractile function restored within 13 days, providing a basis for preclinical and clinical investigations to hasten lymphatic repair and restore contractile lymphatic function after surgery to prevent cancer-acquired lymphedema. Patterns of cancer metastasis after lymphadenectomy were altered, consistent with patterns of re-directed lymphatic drainage."

However, questions remain over the effects of adjuvant therapies on the continued patency of the lymphaticovenous anastomosis. Our study aimed to assess lymphographic outcomes, including ICG pattern and LVB patency, in patients at high risk for breast cancer-associated lymphedema following axillary ILR. METHODS: Baseline ICG lymphography studies performed during ILR of 15 patients were compared to repeat ICG studies obtained during second-stage breast reconstructive procedures to assess for changes in lymphatic flow patterns through the at-risk arm and transit into the axilla. RESULTS: All 15 patients in this study demonstrated linear lymphatic flow in baseline lymphography. Repeat lymphographic studies showed linear lymphatic transit in 12/15 patients. Of these 12 patients, 10 received chemotherapy, and all 12 received post-mastectomy radiation (PMRT). Dermal backflow patterns were recorded in 3/15 patients. All 3 patients received chemotherapy and 2/3 underwent PMRT. Additionally, repeat ICG studies of 7/12 lymphedema-free patients demonstrated clear visualization of linear ICG flow from the lymphatics of the arm into the axilla. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that ICG lymphography can be implemented as a postoperative tool to assess lymphatic function in patients who have undergone ILR in the axilla. Repeat ICG studies in the majority of patients demonstrated linear ICG flow similar to baseline studies. Additionally, ICG flow patterns through the axilla in repeat lymphography provided visual evidence supporting sustained LVB patency, despite axillary irradiation."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We systematically analyzed multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and patient bone marrow cells for their engraftment capacity in immunodeficient mice and validated the response of the resulting xenografts to antimyeloma agents. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using flow cytometry and near infrared fluorescence in-vivo-imaging, growth kinetics of MM cell lines L363 and RPMI8226 and patient bone marrow cells were investigated with use of a murine subcutaneous bone implant, intratibial and intravenous approach in NOD/SCID, NOD/SCID treated with CD122 antibody and NOD/SCID IL-2R\u03b3(null) mice (NSG). RESULTS: Myeloma growth was significantly increased in the absence of natural killer cell activity (NSG or \u03b1CD122-treated NOD/SCID). Comparison of NSG and \u03b1CD122-treated NOD/SCID revealed enhanced growth kinetics in the former, especially with respect to metastatic tumor sites which were exclusively observed therein. In NSG, MM cells were more tumorigenic when injected intratibially than intravenously. In NOD/SCID in contrast, the use of juvenile long bone implants was superior to intratibial or intravenous cancer cell injection. Using the intratibial NSG model, mice developed typical disease symptoms exclusively when implanted with human MM cell lines or patient-derived bone marrow cells, but not with healthy bone marrow cells nor in mock-injected animals. Bortezomib and dexamethasone delayed myeloma progression in L363- as well as patient-derived MM cell bearing NSG. Antitumor activity could be quantified via flow cytometry and in vivo imaging analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the intratibial NSG MM model mimics the clinical situation of the disseminated disease and serves as a valuable tool in the development of novel anticancer strategies."

                "abstract": "To aid preclinical development of novel therapeutics for myeloma, an in vivo model which recapitulates the human condition is required. An important feature of such a model is the interaction of myeloma cells with the bone marrow microenvironment, as this interaction modulates tumour activity and protects against drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore NOD/SCID\u03b3c(null) mice were injected intra-tibially with luciferase-tagged myeloma cells. Disease progression was monitored by weekly bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and measurement of paraprotein levels. Results were compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology. Assessment of model suitability for preclinical drug testing was investigated using bortezomib, melphalan and two novel agents. Cells engrafted at week 3, with a significant increase in BLI radiance occurring between weeks 5 and 7. This was accompanied by an increase in paraprotein secretion, MRI-derived tumour volume and CD138 positive cells within the bone marrow. Treatment with known anti-myeloma agents or novel agents significantly attenuated the increase in all disease markers. In addition, intra-tibial implantation of primary patient plasma cells resulted in development of myeloma within bone marrow. In conclusion, using both myeloma cell lines and primary patient cells, we have developed a model which recapitulates human myeloma by ensuring the key interaction of tumour cells with the microenvironment."

In the present study, we employed the Vk*Myc mouse model of multiple myeloma to assess the impact of TCDD exposure on multiple myeloma pathogenesis. TCDD induced splenomegaly and multiple peripheral blood abnormalities, including anemia and high serum IgG levels. In addition, TCDD triggered bone lytic lesions, as well as renal tubular casts, a phenomenon associated with human myeloma kidney disease. Even in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, TCDD increased serum IgG levels, induced anemia, and increased plasma cell presence in the spleen and bone marrow, hallmarks of benign monoclonal gammopathy. Lastly, TCDD induced AKT activation and the DNA damage response, key pathogenic events in myeloma pathogenesis, in animal spleen and/or bone marrow. These data indicate that TCDD accelerates monoclonal gammopathy development and promotes progression to multiple myeloma in genetically-predisposed mice. This work offers the first direct experimental evidence establishing TCDD as an environmental risk factor for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma."

                "abstract": "Multiple myeloma remains largely incurable. However, a few patients experience more than 10 years of relapse-free survival and can be considered as operationally cured. Interestingly, long-term disease control in multiple myeloma is not restricted to patients with a complete response, since some patients revert to having a profile of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We compared the distribution of multiple compartments of lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of multiple myeloma patients with long-term disease control (n=28), patients with newly diagnosed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n=23), patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (n=23), and age-matched healthy adults (n=10). Similarly to the patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and symptomatic multiple myeloma, patients with long-term disease control showed an expansion of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and natural killer cells. However, the numbers of bone marrow T-regulatory cells were lower in patients with long-term disease control than in those with symptomatic multiple myeloma. It is noteworthy that B cells were depleted in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and in those with symptomatic multiple myeloma, but recovered in both the bone marrow and peripheral blood of patients with long-term disease control, due to an increase in normal bone marrow B-cell precursors and plasma cells, as well as pre-germinal center peripheral blood B cells. The number of bone marrow dendritic cells and tissue macrophages differed significantly between patients with long-term disease control and those with symptomatic multiple myeloma, with a trend to cell count recovering in the former group of patients towards levels similar to those found in healthy adults. In summary, our results indicate that multiple myeloma patients with long-term disease control have a constellation of unique immune changes favoring both immune cytotoxicity and recovery of B-cell production and homing, suggesting improved immune surveillance."

                "abstract": "Plasma cell neoplasms result from the clonal expansion of terminally differentiated, immunoglobulin heavy-chain class switched B cells that typically secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin. The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of plasma cell neoplasms encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders, from the precursor disorder monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to plasma cell leukemia. The classification includes, in addition to precursor lesion MGUS, plasma cell myeloma, plasmacytoma, immunoglobulin deposition diseases, and osteosclerotic myeloma. Plasma cell myeloma is further divided into symptomatic plasma cell myeloma or multiple myeloma (MM), asymptomatic smoldering myeloma (SMM), non-secretory myeloma, and plasma cell leukemia. Although histopathologic cut-off criteria are incorporated into the classification schema, distinction between MGUS, SMM, and MM depends primarily on the presence or absence of end-organ damage, as defined by \"CRAB\" criteria (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, lytic bone lesions, or a combination of these). Systematic evaluation of pathogenetic differences between MGUS and MM should offer invaluable insights into early myelomagenesis. Given the complex, intertwined nature of the malignant plasma cell and its surroundings, multiple pathogenetic mechanisms play a critical role in interactions between neoplastic cells and their microenvironment. Understanding the events leading to end-organ damage, like anemia and bone remodeling, is a critical part of investigating early myelomagenesis and should provide us with better tools for early identification and treatment of these patients."

                "abstract": "Mouse models of human cancer provide an important research tool for elucidating the natural history of neoplastic growth and developing new treatment and prevention approaches. This is particularly true for multiple myeloma (MM), a common and largely incurable neoplasm of post-germinal center, immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes, called plasma cells, that reside in the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) and cause osteolytic lesions and kidney failure among other forms of end-organ damage. The most widely used mouse models used to aid drug and immunotherapy development rely on in vivo propagation of human myeloma cells in immunodeficient hosts (xenografting) or myeloma-like mouse plasma cells in immunocompetent hosts (autografting). Both strategies have made and continue to make valuable contributions to preclinical myeloma, including immune research, yet are ill-suited for studies on tumor development (oncogenesis). Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), such as the widely known V\u03ba*MYC, may overcome this shortcoming because plasma cell tumors (PCTs) develop de novo (spontaneously) in a highly predictable fashion and accurately recapitulate many hallmarks of human myeloma. Moreover, PCTs arise in an intact organism able to mount a complete innate and adaptive immune response and tumor development reproduces the natural course of human myelomagenesis, beginning with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), progressing to smoldering myeloma (SMM), and eventually transitioning to frank neoplasia. Here we review the utility of transplantation-based and transgenic mouse models of human MM for research on immunopathology and -therapy of plasma cell malignancies, discuss strengths and weaknesses of different experimental approaches, and outline opportunities for closing knowledge gaps, improving the outcome of patients with myeloma, and working towards a cure."

                "abstract": "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell (PC) malignancy, which despite significant therapeutic advances, is still considered incurable. This is due to the persistence of chemotherapy-resistant minimal residual disease in the patients' bone marrow (BM) after an effective induction therapy. Immunotherapies targeting surface molecules expressed on the bulk of tumor cells and the chemotherapy-resistant, myeloma-propagating cells could play a central role in this clinical setting. We recently described surface molecule CD229 as a potential therapeutic target for MM. In our current study we assessed the expression of CD229 on different PC subtypes and on cells with a myeloma-propagating phenotype in a total of 77 patients with PC dyscrasias independently at 2 different cancer centers. We found that CD229 was strongly and homogeneously overexpressed on the PC of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering myeloma, MM, and PC leukemia. CD229 was particularly overexpressed on those PC showing an abnormal phenotype such as expression of CD56. Most importantly, CD229 was also highly expressed on those cells in the patients' BM displaying the phenotype of chemotherapy-resistant and myeloma-propagating cells. In conclusion, our combined findings suggest that immunotherapies targeting CD229 will not only be effective for the bulk of tumor cells but will also help to eradicate chemotherapy-resistant cells remaining in the patients' BM after induction treatment. Hopefully, the design of CD229-specific monoclonal antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells will help to achieve prolonged remissions or even cures in MM patients. "

                "abstract": "Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematologic cancer characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow. Numerous studies suggest that the myeloma plasma cells occupy and alter the stromal tissue of the bone marrow as a means of enhancing their survival and growth. However, the nature and magnitude of the changes to the stromal cell tissue remain to be determined. In this study, we used mesenchymal stromal cell and osteoblast-related cell surface marker expression (STRO-1 and alkaline phosphatase, respectively) and flow cytometry to enumerate mesenchymal stromal cell and osteoblast numbers in bone marrow recovered from myeloma patients at the time of diagnosis. Using this approach, we identified an increase in the number of STRO-1 positive colony forming mesenchymal stromal cells and a concomitant decrease in alkaline phophatase osteoblasts. Notably, this increase in mesenchymal stromal cell numbers correlated closely with plasma cell burden at the time of diagnosis. In addition, in comparison with the osteoblast population, the STRO-1+ mesenchymal stromal cell population was found to express higher levels of plasma cell- and osteoclast-activating factors, including RANKL and IL-6, providing a mechanism by which an increase in mesenchymal stromal cells may promote and aid the progression of myeloma. Importantly, these findings were faithfully replicated in the C57BL/KaLwRij murine model of myeloma, suggesting that this model may present a unique and clinically relevant system in which to identify and therapeutically modulate the bone microenvironment and, in turn, alter the progression of myeloma disease.

However, the identity of the cells producing IL-6 in vivo in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) remains the subject of debate. We have developed a sensitive dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique to investigate the expression of IL-6 mRNA by individual bone marrow plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and healthy subjects. IL-6 mRNA could be identified in all immunoglobulin light chain (IgLC) expressing cells from all patients with MM and MGUS. The IL-6 protein could also be detected by direct immunofluorescence in all plasma cells (cytoplasmic light chain positive) from all patients with MM and MGUS. Furthermore, it was also possible to demonstrate cytoplasmic IL-6 staining of plasma cells from patients with MM by flow cytometric analysis. In contrast, neither the IL-6 mRNA or protein could be detected in normal plasma cells from healthy bone marrow donors. These data demonstrate that plasma cells from patients with MM and MGUS express the IL-6 mRNA and synthesize the IL-6 protein and support the hypothesis that autocrine synthesis of IL-6 is of importance in patients with MM."

We have tested the significance of the MoAb Ki-67 in the classification of monoclonal gammopathy and compared the results with the plasma cell labelling index. In benign monoclonal gammopathy the percentage of Ki-67 positive plasma cells (median 1.6%) was significantly lower than in untreated multiple myeloma (median 9.6). Among the patients with more than 10% Ki-67 positive plasma cells there were some very short survivors. The largest growth fractions (median 41.8%) were found in patients with relapsing multiple myeloma indicating here a different growth pattern more resembling the high-grade lymphomas. A linear correlation between the proportion of Ki-67 positive plasma cells and the labelling index was not found. Determination of the plasma cell growth fraction with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 in monoclonal gammopathy may help to discriminate benign monoclonal gammopathy from multiple myeloma and will probably identify a subgroup of multiple myeloma patients with a poor prognosis, including those with relapsing multiple myeloma."

We investigated expression of NOTCH1 and JAGGED1 in bone marrow trephine biopsies of 80 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and 20 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients using immunohistochemical methods. The number of positive tumor cells was counted per 1000 tumor cells and the intensity of staining was assessed semi quantitatively. Multiple myelomas expressed NOTCH1 in 92.31% (72/78) and JAGGED1 in 92.21% (71/77) cases. NOTCH1 staining was strong in the majority of cases (59.7%), whereas JAGGED1 was predominately weak (67.6% of cases). In contrast, both markers were negative in all monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance cases. However, upon progression of disease from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma (seen in 4 patients), analysis of the subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed weak expression of both markers in tumorous plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry results were compared with the pattern of bone marrow infiltration, plasma cell differentiation, and the presence of t(11;14)(q13,q32), t(14;16)(q32;q23),and t(4;14)(p16.3;q23) and overall survival in multiple myeloma patients. A significant correlation was found between strong NOTCH1 staining in multiple myeloma plasma cells and the diffuse type of bone marrow infiltration (P = .002) and an immature morphologic type of plasma cells (P = .043). After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, in multiple myeloma patients no difference in overall survival between NOTCH1 (P = .484) and JAGGED1 (P = .822) positive and negative cases were found. In conclusion, our results indicate importance of NOTCH1 and JAGGED1 expression in plasma cell neoplasia and a possible diagnostic value of their immunohistochemical evaluation of bone marrow infiltrates for multiple myeloma."

T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated effector functions of gammadelta cells are enhanced upon triggering of the activating receptor NKG2D by MICA, a stress-inducible antigen expressed by epithelial and some hematopoietic tumors, including multiple myeloma. Here we show that MICA was expressed not only by myeloma cell lines and by 6 of 10 primary multiple myeloma cells from patients but also by bone marrow plasma cells from all (six of six) patients with preneoplastic gammopathy (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, MGUS), a direct precursor of multiple myeloma. Moreover, compared with multiple myeloma plasma cells, MICA was expressed by MGUS plasma cells at significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels. MICA expressed by myeloma cell lines contributed to killing and IFN-gamma production by Vgamma9/Vdelta2 cells only upon pamidronate treatment, suggesting a dual interaction between Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lymphocytes and multiple myeloma plasma cells involving both TCR triggering and NKG2D-mediated signals. Finally, MICA enhanced killing of freshly derived, pamidronate-treated multiple myeloma cells from patients by gammadelta cells, as indicated by the significantly (P < 0.05) higher gammadelta cytotoxicity against MICA-positive rather than MICA-negative multiple myeloma cells. Our results indicate that MICA expressed by monoclonal plasma cells is functional and correlates with disease stages, suggesting a role for the molecule in the immune surveillance against multiple myeloma. Moreover, pamidronate-activated Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lymphocytes can be exploited in the immune therapy of early stages multiple myeloma and possibly of premalignant disease."

The reciprocal interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the development of MM and the establishment of a tumor-promoting stroma facilitates tumor growth and myeloma progression.

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is one of the most effective first-line chemotherapeutic drugs for multiple myeloma; however, 15% to 20% of high-risk patients do not respond to or become resistant to this drug and the mechanisms of chemoresistance remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that multiple myeloma cells inhibit Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in pre- and immature osteoblasts (OB), and that this OB-Runx2 deficiency induces a cytokine-rich and immunosuppressive microenvironment in the BM. In the current study, we assessed the impact of OB-Runx2 deficiency on the outcome of bortezomib treatment using OB-Runx2+/+ and OB-Runx2-/- mouse models of multiple myeloma. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that OB-Runx2 deficiency induces multiple myeloma cell resistance to bortezomib via the upregulation of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), downregulation of cytotoxic T cells, and activation of TGF\u03b21 in the BM. In multiple myeloma tumor-bearing OB-Runx2-/- mice, treatment with SRI31277, an antagonist of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-mediated TGF\u03b21 activation, reversed the BM immunosuppression and significantly reduced tumor burden. Furthermore, treatment with SRI31277 combined with bortezomib alleviated multiple myeloma cell resistance to bortezomib-induced apoptosis caused by OB-Runx2 deficiency in cocultured cells and produced a synergistic effect on tumor burden in OB-Runx2-/- mice. Depletion of MDSCs by 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine similarly reversed the immunosuppressive effects and bortezomib resistance induced by OB-Runx2 deficiency in tumor-bearing mice, indicating the importance of the immune environment for drug resistance and suggesting new strategies to overcome bortezomib resistance in the treatment of multiple myeloma."

Immune therapies, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promising results in pre-clinical models and clinical trials of solid tumors, such as melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer. Therapeutic strategies targeting the immune microenvironment have also been applied to hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell neoplasia characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells mainly in the bone marrow (BM). MM is associated with both cellular and humoral immune deficiencies, indicating that the evolution of the disease from a precursor state (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering MM (sMM)) is associated with an immunosuppressive milieu that fosters immune escape and tumor growth. Despite significant advances in treatment, MM is mostly an incurable disease. Therefore, it is vital to develop novel therapeutic agents that not only target the MM clone itself but also the MM immune microenvironment. However, the complexity of the BM microenvironment and heterogeneity of tumor cell clones make it a difficult task for developing appropriate immune therapies of MM. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the interaction between malignant plasma cells and the bone marrow immune microenvironment during disease progression."

                "abstract": "Multiple myeloma is incurable once osteolytic lesions have seeded at skeletal sites, but factors mediating this deadly pathogenic advance remain poorly understood. Here, we report evidence of a major role for the cell adhesion molecule CD166, which we discovered to be highly expressed in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary bone marrow cells from patients. CD166+ multiple myeloma cells homed more efficiently than CD166- cells to the bone marrow of engrafted immunodeficient NSG mice. CD166 silencing in multiple myeloma cells enabled longer survival, a smaller tumor burden, and less osteolytic lesions, as compared with mice bearing control cells. CD166 deficiency in multiple myeloma cell lines or CD138+ bone marrow cells from multiple myeloma patients compromised their ability to induce bone resorption in an ex vivo organ culture system. Furthermore, CD166 deficiency in multiple myeloma cells also reduced the formation of osteolytic disease in vivo after intratibial engraftment. Mechanistic investigation revealed that CD166 expression in multiple myeloma cells inhibited osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow-derived osteoblast progenitors by suppressing Runx2 gene expression. Conversely, CD166 expression in multiple myeloma cells promoted osteoclastogenesis by activating TRAF6-dependent signaling pathways in osteoclast progenitors. Overall, our results define CD166 as a pivotal director in multiple myeloma cell homing to the bone marrow and multiple myeloma progression, rationalizing its further study as a candidate therapeutic target for multiple myeloma treatment.

Recent gene expression array analysis has revealed that an MYC activation signature is detected in plasma cell myeloma but not in MGUS. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical studies using membrane CD138 and nuclear MYC double staining on bone marrow biopsies from patients who met the diagnostic criteria of plasma cell myeloma or MGUS. Our study demonstrated nuclear MYC expression in CD138-positive plasma cells in 22 of 26 (84%) plasma cell myeloma samples and in none of the 29 bone marrow samples from patients with MGUS. In addition, our data on the follow-up biopsies from plasma cell myeloma patients with high MYC expression demonstrated that evaluation of MYC expression in plasma cells can be useful in detecting residual disease. We also demonstrated that plasma cells gained MYC expression in 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) when progressing from MGUS to plasma cell myeloma. Analysis of additional lymphomas with plasmacytic differentiation, including lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma, reveals that MYC detection can be a useful tool in the diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma.

            "abstract": "Mutations in GPR179 lead to autosomal recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). This condition represents a signal transmission defect from the photoreceptors to the ON-bipolar cells. To confirm the phenotype, better understand the pathogenic mechanism in vivo, and provide a model for therapeutic approaches, a Gpr179 knock-out mouse model was genetically and functionally characterized. We confirmed that the insertion of a neo/lac Z cassette in intron 1 of Gpr179 disrupts the same gene. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography reveals no obvious retinal structure abnormalities. Gpr179 knock-out mice exhibit a so-called no-b-wave (nob) phenotype with severely reduced b-wave amplitudes in the electroretinogram. Optomotor tests reveal decreased optomotor responses under scotopic conditions. Consistent with the genetic disruption of Gpr179, GPR179 is absent at the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells. While proteins of the same signal transmission cascade (GRM6, LRIT3, and TRPM1) are correctly localized, other proteins (RGS7, RGS11, and GNB5) known to regulate GRM6 are absent at the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells. These results add a new model of cCSNB, which is important to better understand the role of GPR179, its implication in patients with cCSNB, and its use for the development of therapies."

The role of the corresponding protein in the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade remains to be elucidated. Here we genetically and functionally characterize a commercially available Lrit3 knock-out mouse, a model to study the function and the pathogenic mechanism of LRIT3. We confirm that the insertion of a Bgeo/Puro cassette in the knock-out allele introduces a premature stop codon, which presumably codes for a non-functional protein. The mouse line does not harbor other mutations present in common laboratory mouse strains or in other known cCSNB genes. Lrit3 mutant mice exhibit a so-called no b-wave (nob) phenotype with lacking or severely reduced b-wave amplitudes in the scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG), respectively. Optomotor tests reveal strongly decreased optomotor responses in scotopic conditions. No obvious fundus auto-fluorescence or histological retinal structure abnormalities are observed. However, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) reveals thinned inner nuclear layer and part of the retina containing inner plexiform layer, ganglion cell layer and nerve fiber layer in these mice. To our knowledge, this is the first time that SD-OCT technology is used to characterize an animal model for CSNB. This phenotype is noted at 6 weeks and at 6 months. The stationary nob phenotype of mice lacking Lrit3, which we named nob6, confirms the findings previously reported in patients carrying LRIT3 mutations and is similar to other cCSNB mouse models. This novel mouse model will be useful for investigating the pathogenic mechanism(s) associated with LRIT3 mutations and clarifying the role of LRIT3 in the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade. "

                "abstract": "Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of retinal disorders characterized by nonprogressive impairment of night vision, absence of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, and variable degrees of involvement of other visual functions. We report here that mutations in GPR179, encoding an orphan G protein receptor, underlie a form of autosomal-recessive cCSNB. The Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mouse model was initially discovered by the absence of the ERG b-wave, a component that reflects depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) function. We performed genetic mapping, followed by next-generation sequencing of the critical region and detected a large transposon-like DNA insertion in Gpr179. The involvement of GPR179 in DBC function was confirmed in zebrafish and humans. Functional knockdown of gpr179 in zebrafish led to a marked reduction in the amplitude of the ERG b-wave. Candidate gene analysis of GPR179 in DNA extracted from patients with cCSNB identified GPR179-inactivating mutations in two patients. We developed an antibody against mouse GPR179, which robustly labeled DBC dendritic terminals in wild-type mice. This labeling colocalized with the expression of GRM6 and was absent in Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that GPR179 plays a critical role in DBC signal transduction and expands our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate normal rod vision."

Mutations in GRM6 lead to DBC dysfunction and underlie the human condition autosomal recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness. Mouse mutants for Grm6 are important models for this condition. Here we report a new Grm6 mutant, identified in an electroretinogram (ERG) screen of mice maintained at The Jackson Laboratory. The Grm6nob8 mouse has a reduced-amplitude b-wave component of the ERG, which reflects light-evoked DBC activity. Sequencing identified a missense mutation that converts a highly conserved methionine within the ligand binding domain to leucine (p.Met66Leu). Consistent with prior studies of Grm6 mutant mice, the laminar size and structure in the Grm6nob8 retina were comparable to control. The Grm6nob8 phenotype is distinguished from other Grm6 mutants that carry a null allele by a reduced but not absent ERG b-wave, decreased but present expression of mGluR6 at DBC dendritic tips, and mislocalization of mGluR6 to DBC somas. Consistent with a reduced but not absent b-wave, there were a subset of retinal ganglion cells whose responses to light onset have times to peak within the range of those in control retinas. These data indicate that the p.Met66Leu mutant mGluR6 is trafficked less than control. However, the mGluR6 that is localized to the DBC dendritic tips is able to initiate DBC signal transduction. The Grm6nob8 mouse extends the Grm6 allelic series and will be useful for elucidating the role of mGluR6 in DBC signal transduction and in human disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article describes a mouse model of the human disease complete congenital stationary night blindness in which the mutation reduces but does not eliminate GRM6 expression and bipolar cell function, a distinct phenotype from that seen in other Grm6 mouse models."

                "abstract": "Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous retinal disorder. Two forms can be distinguished clinically: complete CSNB (cCSNB) and incomplete CSNB. Individuals with cCSNB have visual impairment under low-light conditions and show a characteristic electroretinogram (ERG). The b-wave amplitude is severely reduced in the dark-adapted state of the ERG, representing abnormal function of ON bipolar cells. Furthermore, individuals with cCSNB can show other ocular features such as nystagmus, myopia, and strabismus and can have reduced visual acuity and abnormalities of the cone ERG waveform. The mode of inheritance of this form can be X-linked or autosomal recessive, and the dysfunction of four genes (NYX, GRM6, TRPM1, and GPR179) has been described so far. Whole-exome sequencing in one simplex cCSNB case lacking mutations in the known genes led to the identification of a missense mutation (c.983G>A [p.Cys328Tyr]) and a nonsense mutation (c.1318C>T [p.Arg440(\u2217)]) in LRIT3, encoding leucine-rich-repeat (LRR), immunoglobulin-like, and transmembrane-domain 3 (LRIT3). Subsequent Sanger sequencing of 89 individuals with CSNB identified another cCSNB case harboring a nonsense mutation (c.1151C>G [p.Ser384(\u2217)]) and a deletion predicted to lead to a premature stop codon (c.1538_1539del [p.Ser513Cysfs(\u2217)59]) in the same gene. Human LRIT3 antibody staining revealed in the outer plexiform layer of the human retina a punctate-labeling pattern resembling the dendritic tips of bipolar cells; similar patterns have been observed for other proteins implicated in cCSNB. The exact role of this LRR protein in cCSNB remains to be elucidated."

The Trpm1(-/-) mouse has been an important animal model for this condition. Here we report a new mouse mutant, tvrm27, identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen. Genetic mapping of the no b-wave electroretinogram (ERG) phenotype of tvrm27 localized the mutation to a chromosomal region that included Trpm1. Complementation testing with Trpm1(-/-) mice confirmed a mutation in Trpm1. Sequencing identified a nucleotide change in exon 23, converting a highly conserved alanine within the pore domain to threonine (p.A1068T). Consistent with prior studies of Trpm1(-/-) mice, no anatomical changes were noted in the Trpm1(tvrm27/tvrm27) retina. The Trpm1(tvrm27/tvrm27) phenotype is distinguished from that of Trpm1(-/-) by the retention of TRPM1 expression on the dendritic tips of depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). While ERG b-wave amplitudes of Trpm1(+/-) heterozygotes are comparable to wild type, those of Trpm1(+/tvrm27) mice are reduced by 32%. A similar reduction in the response of Trpm1(+/tvrm27) DBCs to LY341495 or capsaicin is evident in whole cell recordings. These data indicate that the p.A1068T mutant TRPM1 acts as a dominant negative with respect to TRPM1 channel function. Furthermore, these data indicate that the number of functional TRPM1 channels at the DBC dendritic tips is a key factor in defining DBC response amplitude. The Trpm1(tvrm27/tvrm27) mutant will be useful for elucidating the role of TRPM1 in DBC signal transduction, for determining how Trpm1 mutations impact central visual processing, and for evaluating experimental therapies for cCSNB."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1) is characterized by loss of night vision due to a defect in the retinal ON-bipolar cells (BCs). Mutations in GPR179, encoding the G-protein-coupled receptor 179, have been found in CSNB1 patients. In the mouse, GPR179 is localized to the tips of ON-BC dendrites. In this study we determined the ultrastructural localization of GPR179 in human retina and determined the functional consequences of mutations in GPR179 in patients and mice. METHODS: The localization of GRP179 was analyzed in postmortem human retinas with immunohistochemistry. The functional consequences of the loss of GPR179 were analyzed with standard and 15-Hz flicker ERG protocols. RESULTS: In the human retina, GPR179 is localized on the tips of ON-BC dendrites, which invaginate photoreceptors and terminate juxtaposed to the synaptic ribbon. The 15-Hz flicker ERG abnormalities found in patients with mutations in GPR179 more closely resemble those from patients with mutations in either TRPM1 or NYX than in GRM6. 15-Hz flicker ERG abnormalities of Gpr179(nob5) and Grm6(nob3) mice were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: GRP179 is expressed on dendrites of ON-BCs, indicating that GRP179 is involved in the ON-BCs' signaling cascade. The similarities of 15-Hz flicker ERGs noted in GPR179 patients and NYX or TRPM1 patients suggest that the loss of GPR179 leads to the loss or closure of TRPM1 channels. The difference between the 15-Hz flicker ERGs of mice and humans indicates the presence of important species differences in the retinal activity that this signal represents."

                "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) effectively targets therapeutic genes to photoreceptors, pigment epithelia, M\u00fcller glia and ganglion cells of the retina. To date, no one has shown the ability to correct, with gene replacement, an inherent defect in bipolar cells (BCs), the excitatory interneurons of the retina. Targeting BCs with gene replacement has been difficult primarily due to the relative inaccessibility of BCs to standard AAV vectors. This approach would be useful for restoration of vision in patients with complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1), where signaling through the ON BCs is eliminated due to mutations in their G-protein-coupled cascade genes. For example, the majority of CSNB1 patients carry a mutation in nyctalopin (NYX), which encodes a protein essential for proper localization of the TRPM1 cation channel required for ON BC light-evoked depolarization. As a group, CSNB1 patients have a normal electroretinogram (ERG) a-wave, indicative of photoreceptor function, but lack a b-wave due to defects in ON BC signaling. Despite retinal dysfunction, the retinas of CSNB1 patients do not degenerate. The Nyx(nob) mouse model of CSNB1 faithfully mimics this phenotype. Here, we show that intravitreally injected, rationally designed AAV2(quadY-F+T-V) containing a novel 'Ple155' promoter drives either GFP or YFP_Nyx in postnatal Nyx(nob) mice. In treated Nyx(nob) retina, robust and targeted Nyx transgene expression in ON BCs partially restored the ERG b-wave and, at the cellular level, signaling in ON BCs. Our results support the potential for gene delivery to BCs and gene replacement therapy in human CSNB1. "

This retinal disease is characterized in patients by impaired dim and night vision, associated with other ocular symptoms, including high myopia. cCSNB is caused by a complete loss of signal transmission from photoreceptors to ON-bipolar cells. In this study, we hypothesized that the lack of Gpr179 and the subsequent impaired ON-pathway could lead to myopic features in a mouse model of cCSNB. Using ultra performance liquid chromatography, we show that adult Gpr179-/- mice have a significant decrease in both retinal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, compared to Gpr179+/+ mice. This alteration of the dopaminergic system is thought to be correlated with an increased susceptibility to lens-induced myopia but does not affect the natural refractive development. Altogether, our data added a novel myopia model, which could be used to identify therapeutic interventions."

                "abstract": "Parallel visual pathways are initiated at the first retinal synapse by signaling between the rod and cone photoreceptors and two general classes of bipolar cells. For normal function, ON or depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) require the G-protein-coupled receptor, mGluR6, an intact G-protein-coupled cascade and the transient receptor potential melastatin 1 (TRPM1) cation channel. In addition, another seven transmembrane protein, GPR179, is required for DBC function and recruits the regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins, RGS7 and RGS11, to the dendritic tips of the DBCs. Here we use the Gpr179(nob5) mouse, which lacks GPR179 and has a no b-wave electroretinogram (ERG) phenotype, to demonstrate that despite the absence of both GPR179 and RGS7/RGS11, a small dark-adapted ERG b-wave remains and can be enhanced with long duration flashes. Consistent with the ERG, the mGluR6-mediated gating of TRPM1 can be evoked pharmacologically in Gpr179(nob5) and RGS7(-/-)/RGS11(-/-) rod BCs if strong stimulation conditions are used. In contrast, direct gating of TRPM1 by capsaicin in RGS7(-/-)/RGS11(-/-) and WT rod BCs is similar, but severely compromised in Gpr179(nob5) rod BCs. Noise and standing current analyses indicate that the remaining channels in Gpr179(nob5) and RGS7(-/-)/RGS11(-/-) rod BCs have a very low open probability. We propose that GPR179 along with RGS7 and RGS11 controls the ability of the mGluR6 cascade to gate TRPM1. In addition to its role in localizing RGS7 and RGS11 to the dendritic tips, GPR179 via a direct interaction with the TRPM1 channel alters its ability to be gated directly by capsaicin. "

GRM6 mutations are the third most prevalent cause of cCSNB. The Grm6-/- mouse model mimics the human phenotype, showing no b-wave in the electroretinogram (ERG) and a loss of mGluR6 and other proteins of the same cascade at the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Our aim was to restore protein localization and function in Grm6-/- adult mice targeting specifically ON-BCs or the whole retina. Methods: Adeno-associated virus-encoding Grm6 under two different promoters (GRM6-Grm6 and CAG-Grm6) were injected intravitreally in P15 Grm6-/- mice. ERG recordings at 2 and 4 months were performed in Grm6+/+, untreated and treated Grm6-/- mice. Similarly, immunolocalization studies were performed on retinal slices before or after treatment using antibodies against mGluR6, TRPM1, GPR179, RGS7, RGS11, G\u03b25, and dystrophin. Results: Following treatment, mGluR6 was localized to the dendritic tips of ON-BCs when expressed with either promoter. The relocalization efficiency in mGluR6-transduced retinas at the OPL was 2.5% versus 11% when the GRM6-Grm6 and CAG-Grm6 were used, respectively. Albeit no functional rescue was seen in ERGs, relocalization of TRPM1, GPR179, and G\u03b25 was also noted using both constructs. The restoration of the localization of RGS7, RGS11, and dystrophin was more obvious in retinas treated with GRM6-Grm6 than in retinas treated with CAG-Grm6. Conclusions: Our findings show the potential of treating cCSNB with GRM6 mutations; however, it appears that the transduction rate must be improved to restore visual function."

                "abstract": "Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of non-progressive retinal disorder with largely normal fundus appearance. The mode of inheritance can be autosomal dominant (adCSNB), autosomal recessive (arCSNB) or X-chromosomal (XLCSNB). Additional ocular signs can be myopia, hyperopia, strabismus, nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. The Riggs and Schubert-Bornschein form of CSNB can be discriminated by electroretinography. While the Riggs form represents a dysfunction of the rods, a signal transmission defect from photoreceptors to bipolar cell is described in patients with the more frequently occurring Schubert-Bornschein form. The Schubert-Bornschein form can be further divided into incomplete (icCSNB) and complete (cCSNB) showing different electroretinograms (ERGs). While patients with cCSNB show a dysfunction of the ON-signaling pathway, patients with icCSNB show a dysfunction of the ON- and OFF-signaling pathways, affecting visual acuity as well. Using classical linkage, candidate gene analyses and more recent next-generation sequencing approaches, to date, mutations in 13 different genes have been associated with this disease. In vitro and in vivo models showed a correlation of the phenotype of patients with the expression, protein localization and function of the respective molecules: genes, mutated in patients with the Riggs form of CSNB have an important role in the rod phototransduction cascade. Genes mutated in patients with icCSNB, code for proteins important for glutamate neurotransmitter release at the synaptic cleft of the photoreceptors. Genes mutated in patients with cCSNB, code for proteins important for glutamate uptake and further signal transmission to the ON-bipolar cells. Preliminary in vivo studies showed that CSNB may be cured by gene therapy. These studies concerning CSNB are important for the precise diagnosis of patients with this disease, but are also helpful in deciphering key molecules essential for signal transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells. So far, it is a poorly understood field."

                "abstract": "Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a non-progressive, clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease of impaired night vision. We report a naturally-occurring, stationary, autosomal recessive phenotype in beagle dogs with normal daylight vision but absent night vision. Affected dogs had normal retinas on clinical examination, but showed no detectable rod responses. They had \"negative-type\" mixed rod and cone responses in full-field ERGs. Their photopic long-flash ERGs had normal OFF-responses associated with severely reduced ON-responses. The phenotype is similar to the Schubert-Bornschein form of complete CSNB in humans. Homozygosity mapping ruled out most known CSNB candidates as well as CACNA2D4 and GNB3. Three remaining genes were excluded based on sequencing the open reading frame and intron-exon boundaries (RHO, NYX), causal to a different form of CSNB (RHO) or X-chromosome (NYX, CACNA1F) location. Among the genes expressed in the photoreceptors and their synaptic terminals, and mGluR6 cascade and modulators, reduced expression of GNAT1, CACNA2D4 and NYX was observed by qRT-PCR in both carrier (n = 2) and affected (n = 2) retinas whereas CACNA1F was down-regulated only in the affecteds. Retinal morphology revealed normal cellular layers and structure, and electron microscopy showed normal rod spherules and synaptic ribbons. No difference from normal was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for antibodies labeling rods, cones and their presynaptic terminals. None of the retinas showed any sign of stress. Selected proteins of mGluR6 cascade and its modulators were examined by IHC and showed that PKC\u03b1 weakly labeled the rod bipolar somata in the affected, but intensely labeled axonal terminals that appeared thickened and irregular. Dendritic terminals of ON-bipolar cells showed increased Go\u03b1 labeling. Both PKC\u03b1 and Go\u03b1 labeled the more prominent bipolar dendrites that extended into the OPL in affected but not normal retinas. Interestingly, RGS11 showed no labeling in the affected retina. Our results indicate involvement of a yet unknown gene in this canine model of complete CSNB. "

                "abstract": "Purpose: Mutations in LRIT3 lead to complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). Using a cCSNB mouse model lacking Lrit3 (nob6), we recently have shown that LRIT3 has a role in the correct localization of TRPM1 (transient receptor potential melastatin 1) to the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells (BCs), contacting both rod and cone photoreceptors. Furthermore, postsynaptic clustering of other mGluR6 cascade components is selectively eliminated at the dendritic tips of cone ON-BCs. The purpose of this study was to further define the role of LRIT3 in structural and functional organization of cone synapses. Methods: Exhaustive electroretinogram analysis was performed in a patient with LRIT3 mutations. Multielectrode array recordings were performed at the level of retinal ganglion cells in nob6 mice. Targeting of GluR1 and GluR5 at the dendritic tips of OFF-BCs in nob6 retinas was assessed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. The ultrastructure of photoreceptor synapses was evaluated by electron microscopy in nob6 mice. Results: The patient with LRIT3 mutations had a selective ON-BC dysfunction with relatively preserved OFF-BC responses. In nob6 mice, complete lack of ON-pathway function with robust, yet altered signaling processing in OFF-pathways was detected. Consistent with these observations, molecules essential for the OFF-BC signaling were normally targeted to the synapse. Finally, synaptic contacts made by ON-BC but not OFF-BC neurons with the cone pedicles were disorganized without ultrastructural alterations in cone terminals, horizontal cell processes, or synaptic ribbons. Conclusions: These results suggest that LRIT3 is likely involved in coordination of the transsynaptic communication between cones and ON-BCs during synapse formation and function."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Mutations in GPR179, which encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 179, lead to autosomal recessive complete (c) congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), which is characterized by an ON-bipolar retinal cell dysfunction. This study further defined the exact site of Gpr179 expression and its protein localization in human retina and elucidated the pathogenic mechanism of the reported missense and splice site mutations. METHODS: RNA in situ hybridization was performed with mouse retinal sections. A commercially available antibody was validated with GPR179-overexpressing COS-1 cells and applied to human retinal sections. Live-cell extracellular staining along with subsequent intracellular immunolocalization and ELISA studies were performed using mammalian cells overexpressing wild-type or missense mutated GPR179. Wild-type and splice site-mutated mini-gene constructs were transiently transfected, and RNA was extracted. RT-PCR-amplified products were cloned, and Sanger sequenced. RESULTS: Mouse Gpr179 transcript was expressed in the upper part of the inner nuclear layer, and the respective human protein localized at the dendritic tips of bipolar cells in human retina. The missense mutations p.Tyr220Cys, p.Gly455Asp, and p.His603Tyr led to severely reduced cell surface localization, whereas p.Asp126His did not. The mutated splice donor site altered GPR179 splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the site of expression and protein localization of human and mouse GPR179 is similar to that of other proteins implicated in cCSNB. For most of the mutations identified so far, loss of the GPR179 protein function seems to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism leading to this form of cCSNB."

One type of CSNB is associated with defects in genes (NYX, GRM6, TRPM1, GPR179, and LRIT3) involved in the mGluR6 signaling cascade at the ON-BC dendritic tips. We have previously characterized a canine model of LRIT3-CSNB and demonstrated short-term safety and efficacy of an ON-BC targeting AAV-LRIT3 (AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE) gene therapy. Herein, we demonstrate long-term functional recovery and molecular restoration following subretinal injection of the ON-BC targeting AAV-LRIT3 vector in all eight treated eyes for up to 32\u00a0months. Following subretinal administration of the therapeutic vector, expression of the LRIT3 transgene, as well as restoration of mGluR6 signaling cascade member TRPM1, were confirmed in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the treated area. However, further investigation of the transgene LRIT3 transcript expression by RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) revealed off-target expression in non-BCs including the photoreceptors, inner nuclear, and ganglion cell layers, despite the use of a mutant AAVK9#4 capsid and an improved mGluR6 promoter designed to specifically transduce and promote expression in ON-BCs. While the long-term therapeutic potential of AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE is promising, we highlight the necessity for further optimization of AAV-LRIT3 therapy in the canine CSNB model prior to its clinical application."

Since the disease is non-degenerative and stable, treatment could theoretically be administrated at any time in life, making it a promising target for gene therapy. Until now, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated therapies lead to significant functional improvements only in newborn cCSNB mice. Here we aimed to restore protein localization and function in adult Lrit3 -/ - mice. LRIT3 localizes in the outer plexiform layer and is crucial for TRPM1 localization at the dendritic tips of ON-BCs and the electroretinogram (ERG)-b-wave. AAV2-7m8-Lrit3 intravitreal injections were performed targeting either ON-BCs, photoreceptors (PRs), or both. Protein localization of LRIT3 and TRPM1 at the rod-to-rod BC synapse, functional rescue of scotopic responses, and ON-responses detection at the ganglion cell level were achieved in a few mice when ON-BCs alone or both PRs and ON-BCs, were targeted. More importantly, a significant number of treated adult Lrit3 -/- mice revealed an ERG b-wave recovery\u00a0under scotopic conditions, improved optomotor responses, and on-time ON-responses at the ganglion cell level when PRs were targeted. Functional rescue was maintained for at least 4\u00a0months after treatment."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid precursor protein knockout mice (APP-KO) have impaired differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells. APP is part of a gene family and its paralogue amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) has both shared as well as distinct expression patterns to APP, including in the retina. Given the impact of APP in the retina we investigated how APLP2 expression affected the retina using APLP2 knockout mice (APLP2-KO). RESULTS: Using histology, morphometric analysis with noninvasive imaging technique and electron microscopy, we showed that APLP2-KO retina displayed abnormal formation of the outer synaptic layer, accompanied with greatly impaired photoreceptor ribbon synapses in adults. Moreover, APLP2-KO displayed a significant decease in ON-bipolar, rod bipolar and type 2 OFF-cone bipolar cells (36, 21 and 63\u00a0%, respectively). Reduction of the number of bipolar cells was accompanied with disrupted dendrites, reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 at the dendritic tips and alteration of axon terminals in the OFF laminae of the inner plexiform layer. In contrast, the APP-KO photoreceptor ribbon synapses and bipolar cells were intact. The APLP2-KO retina displayed numerous phenotypic similarities with the congenital stationary night blindness, a non-progressive retinal degeneration disease characterized by the loss of night vision. The pathological phenotypes in the APLP2-KO mouse correlated to altered transcription of genes involved in pre- and postsynatic structure/function, including CACNA1F, GRM6, TRMP1 and G\u03b10, and a normal scotopic a-wave electroretinogram amplitude, markedly reduced scotopic electroretinogram b-wave and modestly reduced photopic cone response. This confirmed the impaired function of the photoreceptor ribbon synapses and retinal bipolar cells, as is also observed in congenital stationary night blindness. Since congenital stationary night blindness present at birth, we extended our analysis to retinal differentiation and showed impaired differentiation of different bipolar cell subtypes and an altered temporal sequence of development from OFF to ON laminae in the inner plexiform layer. This was associated with the altered expression patterns of bipolar cell generation and differentiation factors, including MATH3, CHX10, VSX1 and OTX2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that APLP2 couples retina development and synaptic genes and present the first evidence that APLP2 expression may be linked to synaptic disease."

                "abstract": "Mutations in LRIT3 lead to complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). The exact role of LRIT3 in ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade remains to be elucidated. Recently, we have characterized a novel mouse model lacking Lrit3 [no b-wave 6, (Lrit3(nob6/nob6) )], which displays similar abnormalities to patients with cCSNB with LRIT3 mutations. Here we compare the localization of components of the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade in wild-type and Lrit3(nob6/nob6) retinal sections by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. An anti-LRIT3 antibody was generated. Immunofluorescent staining of LRIT3 in wild-type mice revealed a specific punctate labeling in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), which was absent in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice. LRIT3 did not co-localize with ribeye or calbindin but co-localized with mGluR6. TRPM1 staining was severely decreased at the dendritic tips of all depolarizing bipolar cells in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice. mGluR6, GPR179, RGS7, RGS11 and G\u03b25 immunofluorescence was absent at the dendritic tips of cone ON-bipolar cells in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice, while it was present at the dendritic tips of rod bipolar cells. Furthermore, peanut agglutinin (PNA) labeling was severely reduced in the OPL in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice. This study confirmed the localization of LRIT3 at the dendritic tips of depolarizing bipolar cells in mouse retina and demonstrated the dependence of TRPM1 localization on the presence of LRIT3. As tested components of the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade and PNA revealed disrupted localization, an additional function of LRIT3 in cone synapse formation is suggested. These results point to a possibly different regulation of the mGluR6 signaling cascade between rod and cone ON-bipolar cells. "

Subsequent whole-genome sequencing identified a 1\u2009bp deletion in LRIT3 segregating with CSNB.

Genetic variants in LRIT3 have been associated with CSNB in patients although there is limited evidence regarding its apparently critical function in the mGluR6 pathway in ON-BCs. We determine that in the canine CSNB retina, the mutant LRIT3 is correctly localized to the region correlating with the ON-BC dendritic tips, albeit with reduced immunolabelling. The LRIT3-CSNB canine model has direct translational potential enabling studies to help understand the CSNB pathogenesis as well as to develop new therapies targeting the secondary neurons of the retina."

In view of these findings and the prominent peripheral nervous system involvement in this laminin-\u03b12 disorder we evaluated GA's effect on dy2J/dy2J motor nerve conduction electrophysiologically. METHODS: Left sciatic-tibial motor nerve conduction studies were performed on wild type (WT) mice (n\u202f=\u202f10), control dy2J/dy2J mice (n\u202f=\u202f11), and GA treated dy2J/dy2J mice (n\u202f=\u202f10) at 18\u202fweeks of age. RESULTS: Control dy2J/dy2J mice average velocities (34.49\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.15\u202fm/s) were significantly slower than WT (62.57\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.23\u202fm/s; p\u202f<\u202f0.0005), confirming the clinical observation of hindlimb paresis in dy2J/dy2J mice attributed to peripheral neuropathy.

CONCLUSION: In this study we show for the first time improvement in motor nerve conduction velocity of LAMA2-CMD dy2J/dy2J mouse model's hereditary peripheral neuropathy following GA treatment.

To date, no effective therapy has been clinically available. Laminin-\u03b11, which shares significant similarities with laminin-\u03b12, has been proven as a viable compensatory modifier. To evaluate its clinical applicability, we establish a Lama2 exon-3-deletion mouse model (dyH/dyH). The dyH/dyH mice exhibit early lethality and typical LAMA2-CMD phenotypes, allowing the evaluation of various endpoints. In dyH/dyH mice treated with synergistic activation mediator-based CRISPRa-mediated Lama1 upregulation, a nearly doubled median survival is observed, as well as improvements in weight and grip. Significant therapeutical effects are revealed by MRI, serum biochemical indices, and muscle pathology studies. Treating LAMA2-CMD with LAMA1 upregulation is feasible, and early intervention can alleviate symptoms and extend lifespan. Additionally, we reveal the limitations of LAMA1 upregulation, including high-dose mortality and non-sustained expression, which require further optimization in future studies."

Thus, effective treatments are urgently needed. LAMA2-CMD is either a severe, early-onset condition with complete laminin \u03b12 chain-deficiency or a milder, late-onset form with partial laminin \u03b12 chain-deficiency. Mouse models dy3K/dy3K and dy2J/dy2J, respectively, recapitulate these two forms of LAMA2-CMD very well. We have previously demonstrated that laminin \u03b11 chain significantly reduces muscular dystrophy in laminin \u03b12 chain-deficient dy3K/dy3K mice. Among all the different pre-clinical approaches that have been evaluated in mice, laminin \u03b11 chain-mediated therapy has been shown to be one of the most effective lines of attack. However, it has remained unclear if laminin \u03b11 chain-mediated treatment is also applicable for partial laminin \u03b12 chain-deficiency. Hence, we have generated dy2J/dy2J mice (that express a substantial amount of an N-terminal truncated laminin \u03b12 chain) overexpressing laminin \u03b11 chain in the neuromuscular system. The laminin \u03b11 chain transgene ameliorated the dystrophic phenotype, restored muscle strength and reduced peripheral neuropathy. Thus, these findings provide additional support for the development of laminin \u03b11 chain-based therapy for LAMA2-CMD."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase when oxygen homeostasis is not maintained and, here, we investigate whether oxidative stress indeed is involved in the pathogenesis of LAMA2-CMD. We also analyze the effects of two antioxidant molecules, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and vitamin E, on disease progression in the dy2J/dy2J mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. We demonstrate increased ROS levels in LAMA2-CMD mouse and patient skeletal muscle. Furthermore, NAC treatment (150 mg/kg IP for 6 days/week for 3 weeks) led to muscle force loss prevention, reduced central nucleation and decreased the occurrence of apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress in LAMA2-CMD muscle. In addition, vitamin E (40 mg/kg oral gavage for 6 days/week for 2 weeks) improved morphological features and reduced inflammation and ROS levels in dy2J/dy2J skeletal muscle.

Currently, there is no treatment for this detrimental disorder. Development of therapies is largely hindered by lack of understanding of mechanisms involved in the disease initiation and progress, both in patients but also in mouse models that are commonly used in the preclinical setup. Here, we unveil the first pathogenic events and characterise the disease development in a mouse model for LAMA2-CMD (dy3K/dy3K), by analysing muscles at perinatal, neonatal and postnatal stages. We found that apoptotic muscle fibres were present as early as postnatal day 1. Other typical dystrophic hallmarks (muscle degeneration, inflammation, and extensive production of the extracellular matrix proteins) were clearly evident already at postnatal day 4, and the highest degree of muscle deterioration was reached by day 7. Interestingly, the severe phenotype of limb muscles partially recovered on days 14 and 21, despite worsening of the general condition of the dy3K/dy3K mouse by that age. We found that masticatory muscles were severely affected in dy3K/dy3K mice and this may be an underlying cause of their malnutrition, which contributes to death around day 21. We also showed that several signalling pathways were affected already in 1-day-old dy3K/dy3K muscle. Therapeutic tests in the dy3K/dy3K mouse model should therefore be initiated shortly after birth, but should also take into account timing and correlation between regenerative and pathogenic events."

One form, MDC1A, is the result of laminin alpha-2 deficiency and results in significant weakness, respiratory insufficiency and early death. Modification of apoptosis is one potential pathway for therapy in these patients. METHODS: dy(2J) mice were treated with vehicle, 0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg of omigapil daily via oral gavage over 17.5 weeks. Untreated age matched BL6 mice were used as controls. Functional, behavioral and histological measurements were collected. RESULTS: dy(2J) mice treated with omigapil showed improved respiratory rates compared to vehicle treated dy(2J) mice (396 to 402 vs. 371 breaths per minute, p<0.03) and similar to control mice. There were no statistical differences in normalized forelimb grip strength between dy(2J) and controls at baseline or after 17.5 weeks and no significant differences seen among the dy(2J) treatment groups. At 30-33 weeks of age, dy(2J) mice treated with 0.1 mg/kg omigapil showed significantly more movement time and less rest time compared to vehicle treated. dy(2J) mice showed normal cardiac systolic function throughout the trial. dy(2J) mice had significantly lower hindlimb maximal (p<0.001) and specific force (p<0.002) compared to the control group at the end of the trial. There were no statistically significant differences in maximal or specific force among treatments. dy(2J) mice treated with 0.1 mg/kg/day omigapil showed decreased percent fibrosis in both gastrocnemius (p<0.03) and diaphragm (p<0.001) compared to vehicle, and in diaphragm (p<0.013) when compared to 1 mg/kg/day omigapil treated mice. Omigapil treated dy(2J) mice demonstrated decreased apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Omigapil therapy (0.1 mg/kg) improved respiratory rate and decreased skeletal and respiratory muscle fibrosis in dy(2J) mice. These results support a putative role for the use of omigapil in laminin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy patients."

We have previously employed profiling techniques to elucidate molecular patterns and demonstrated significant metabolic impairment in skeletal muscle from LAMA2-CMD patients and mouse models. Thus, we hypothesize that skeletal muscle metabolism may be a promising pharmacological target to improve muscle function in LAMA2-CMD. Here, we have investigated whether the multifunctional medication metformin could be used to reduce disease in the dy2J/dy2J mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. First, we show gender disparity for several pathological hallmarks of LAMA2-CMD. Second, we demonstrate that metformin treatment significantly increases weight gain and energy efficiency, enhances muscle function and improves skeletal muscle histology in female dy2J/dy2J mice (and to a lesser extent in dy2J/dy2J males). Thus, our current data suggest that metformin may be a potential future supportive treatment that improves many of the pathological characteristics of LAMA2-CMD."

The dystrophic phenotype in the dy3K/dy3K Lama2-/- mouse were evaluated with transgenes driving expression of two synthetic laminin-binding linker proteins. Transgenic muscle-specific expression of \u03b1LNNd, a chimeric protein that enables \u03b14-laminin polymerization, and miniagrin (mag), a protein that increases laminin binding to the receptor \u03b1DG, separately improved median mouse survival two-fold. The double transgenes (DT) improved mean survival three-fold with increases in overall body weight, muscle size, and grip strength, but, given absence of neuronal expression, did not prevent hindlimb paresis. Muscle improvements included increased myofiber size and number and reduced fibrosis. Myofiber hypertrophy with increased mTOR and Akt phosphorylation were characteristics of mag-dy3K/dy3K and DT-dy3K/dy3K muscle. Elevations of matrix-bound \u03b14-, \u03b21 and \u03b31 laminin subunits were detected in muscle extracts and immunostained sections in response to DT expression. Collectively, these findings reveal a complimentary polymerization and \u03b1DG-binding benefit to Lama2-/- mouse muscle largely mediated through modified laminin-411."

In order to identify LAMA2-CMD biomarkers we have profiled miRNAs in urine from the dy2J /dy2J mouse model of LAMA2-CMD at three distinct time points (representing asymptomatic, initial and established disease). We demonstrate that unique groups of miRNAs are differentially expressed at each time point. We suggest that urine miRNAs can be sensitive biomarkers for different stages of LAMA2-CMD."

                "abstract": "LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD or MDC1A) is a devastating congenital muscular dystrophy that is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene encoding laminin-\u03b12, the long chain of several heterotrimeric laminins. Laminins are essential components of the extracellular matrix that interface with underlying cells. The pathology of LAMA2 MD patients is dominated by an early-onset, severe muscular dystrophy that ultimately leads to death by respiratory insufficiency. However, pathology in nonmuscle tissues has been described. Prior work in the dyW /dyW mouse model for LAMA2 MD has shown that two linker proteins, mini-agrin and \u03b1LNNd, when expressed in skeletal muscle fibers, greatly increase survival from a few months up to more than 2 years. However, the restoration of skeletal muscle function accentuates the pathology in nonmuscle tissue in dyW /dyW mice, first and foremost in the peripheral nerve resulting in paralysis of the hind limbs. We now show that the expression of the two linker proteins in all tissues ameliorates the muscular dystrophy and prevents the appearance of the hind limb paralysis. Importantly, the same ameliorating effect of the linker proteins was seen in dy3K /dy3K mice, which represent the most severe mouse model of LAMA2 MD. In summary, these data show that the two linker proteins can compensate the loss of laminin-\u03b12 in muscle and peripheral nerve, which are the two organs most affected in LAMA2 MD. These results are of key importance for designing appropriate expression constructs for mini-agrin and \u03b1LNNd to develop a gene therapy for LAMA2 MD patients."

The main weakness of this treatment arises from the low efficiency and sporadic nature of delivery of the neutrally charged PMO into muscle fibers, the mechanism of which is unknown.Recently, using wild-type and dystrophic mdx52 mice, we showed that muscle fibers took up PMO more efficiently during myotube formation. Interestingly, through in situ hybridization, we detected PMO mainly in embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating fibers. Next, we tested the therapeutic potential of PMO in laminin-alpha2 (laminin-\u03b12) chain-null dy 3K/dy 3K mice, a model of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) with active muscle regeneration. We confirmed the recovery of the laminin-\u03b12 chain following skipping of the mutated exon 4 in dy 3K/dy 3K mice, which prolonged the life span of the animals slightly. These findings support the theory that PMO entry into fibers is dependent on the developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on dystrophinless muscle membranes, and provide a platform for the future development of PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration. Herein, we describe the methods for PMO transfection/injection and evaluation of the efficacy of exon skipping in the laminin-\u03b12-deficient dy 3K/dy 3K mouse model both in vitro and in vivo."

Due to the large size of the laminin \u03b12 cDNA and heterotrimeric structure of the protein, it is challenging to develop a gene-replacement therapy. Our group has developed a novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector carrying the mini-agrin, which is a non-homologous functional substitute for the mutated laminin \u03b12. A significant therapeutic effect in skeletal muscle was observed in our previous study using AAV serotype 1 (AAV1). In this investigation, we examined AAV9 vector, which has more widespread transduction than AAV1, to determine if the therapeutic effects could be further improved. As expected, AAV9-mini-agrin treatment offered enhanced therapeutic effects over the previously used AAV1-mini-agrin in extending mouse lifespan and improvement of muscle pathology. Additionally, overexpression of mini-agrin in peripheral nerves of dyw/dyw mice partially amended nerve pathology as evidenced by improved motor function and sensorimotor processing, partial restoration of myelination, partial restoration of basement membrane via EM examination, as well as decreased regeneration of Schwann cells. In conclusion, our studies indicate that overexpression of mini-agrin into dyw/dyw mice offers profound therapeutic effects in both skeletal muscle and nervous system."

The average ABR thresholds to tone-burst stimuli for four frequencies (4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz) were determined and statistically compared by ANOVA. The dy/dy mice demonstrated elevated auditory thresholds ranging from 25 to 27 dB at each frequency tested (p<0.0001). Anatomic evaluations of the ears revealed pathology ranging from extensive connective tissue infiltration within the inner ear to possible minor defects in the cells of the organ of Corti. These anatomic and physiologic observations suggest that the extracellular matrix protein laminin plays a crucial role in normal cochlear function. Furthermore, the dy congenital muscular dystrophy mouse offers a novel model for evaluation of sensorineural hearing loss associated with muscular dystrophy."

Immune cells have been shown to play a role in the regulation of motor neuron survival after a peripheral nerve injury. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of immune system augmentation with use of the antigen glatiramer acetate, which is known to affect T-cell immunity, on peripheral nerve regeneration. METHODS: Wild-type and nude-type (T-cell-deficient) rats underwent crush injury of the sciatic nerve. Three and six weeks after the injury, the sciatic nerve was examined, both functionally (on the basis of footprint analysis and the tibialis anterior muscle response and weight) and histologically (on the basis of axon count). RESULTS: Significantly greater muscle responses were measured after three weeks in the group of wild-type rats that were treated with glatiramer acetate (control limb:injured limb ratio, 0.05 for the glatiramer acetate group [n = 9], compared with 0.51 for the saline solution group [n = 8]; p < 0.05). Higher axon counts were also found in this group (control limb:injured limb ratio, -0.07 for the glatiramer acetate group [n = 10], compared with 0.29 for the saline solution group [n = 8]; p < 0.05). The nude-type rats showed no response to the intervention after three weeks but showed a delayed response after six weeks. A second dose of glatiramer acetate, delivered forty-eight hours after the injury, did not result in an improved response as compared with the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found that a single treatment with glatiramer acetate resulted in accelerated functional and histological recovery after sciatic nerve crush injury. The role of T-cell immunity in the mechanism of glatiramer acetate was suggested by the partial and late response found in the T-cell-deficient rats."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Laminin\u03b12-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) is a cureless disease associated with severe disability and shortened lifespan. Previous studies have shown reduced fibrosis and restored skeletal muscle remodeling following treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II type I receptor blocker. We therefore evaluated the effect of losartan treatment in the dy(2J) /dy(2J) mouse model of MDC1A. METHODS: Homozygous dy(2J) /dy(2J) and control mice were treated with losartan or placebo for 12 weeks from 6 weeks of age. Outcome measures included hindlimb and forelimb muscle strength by Grip Strength Meter and quantitative muscle fibrosis parameters. Losartan's effects on transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were evaluated with Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and cytokine measurements. RESULTS: Losartan treatment was associated with significant impressive improvement in muscle strength and amelioration of fibrosis. Administration of losartan inhibited TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, resulting in decreased serum TGF-\u03b21 level and reduced downstream phosphorylated (P) Smad2/3 proteins. Moreover, losartan activated Smad7 protein, a key negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. In addition, losartan treatment inhibited the MAPK cascade as shown by decreased expression of P-p38 MAPK, P-c-jun-N-terminal kinase, and P-extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in the treated mice. INTERPRETATION: Losartan, a commonly prescribed US Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for hypertension, demonstrated clinical improvement and amelioration of fibrosis in the dy(2J) /dy(2J) mouse model of MDC1A via TGF-\u03b2 and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of this study support pursuing a clinical trial of losartan treatment in children with MDC1A."

The dy(2J)/dy(2J) mice had significantly increased RAS expression and activity compared with the wild type mice. FTS treatment significantly decreased RAS expression and activity. In addition, phosphorylation of ERK, a Ras downstream protein, was significantly decreased following FTS treatment in the dy(2J)/dy(2J) mice. Clinically, FTS treated mice showed significant improvement in hind limb muscle strength measured by electronic grip strength meter. Significant reduction of fibrosis was demonstrated in the treated group by quantitative Sirius Red staining and lower muscle collagen content. FTS effect was associated with significantly inhibition of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. We conclude that active RAS inhibition by FTS was associated with attenuated fibrosis and improved muscle strength in the dy(2J)/dy(2J) mouse model of congenital muscular dystrophy."

Mice homozygous for the dy(2J) allele of LAMA2 express a laminin alpha2 subunit that has a deletion in the amino-terminal domain VI, providing an animal model for study of the molecular basis of congenital muscular dystrophy [2] [3]. Domain VI is predicted to be involved in laminin polymerization, along with amino-terminal domains from laminin beta and gamma chains [4]. In a solution-polymerization assay, we found that purified dy(2J) laminin assembled poorly and formed little polymer, in contrast to wild-type muscle laminin. Furthermore, dissolution of the collagen IV network caused dy(2J) laminin to be released into solution, indicating that laminin polymers within the skeletal muscle basement membrane were defective. In addition to loss of polymerization, dy(2J) laminin had a reduced affinity for heparin. Finally, recombinant laminin engineered with the dy(2J) deletion was more sensitive to proteolysis and was readily cleaved near the junction of domains V and VI. Thus, the dy(2J) deletion selectively disrupts polymer formation, reduces affinity for heparin, and destabilizes domain VI. These are the first specific functional defects to be identified in a muscular dystrophy laminin, and it is likely that these defects contribute to the abnormalities seen in dy(2J)/dy(2J) muscle and nerve."

Complete merosin deficiency is typically associated with a more severe congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), clinically manifested by hypotonia and weakness at birth, the development of contractures of large joints, and progressive respiratory involvement. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness typically prevent independent ambulation. Partial merosin deficiency is mostly manifested by later onset limb-girdle weakness and joint contractures so that independent ambulation is typically achieved. Collectively, complete and partial merosin deficiency is referred to as LAMA2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RDs) and represents one of the most common forms of congenital muscular dystrophies worldwide. LAMA2-RDs are classically characterized by both central and peripheral nervous system involvement with abnormal appearing white matter (WM) on brain MRI and dystrophic appearing muscle on muscle biopsy as well as creatine kinase (CK) levels commonly elevated to >1,000 IU/L. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved diagnostic abilities for LAMA2-RD, and the majority of patients with merosin deficiency carry recessive pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene. The existence of multiple animal models for LAMA2-RDs has helped to advance our understanding of laminin-211 and has been instrumental in preclinical research progress and translation to clinical trials. The first clinical trial for the LAMA2-RDs was a phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety study of the anti-apoptotic compound omigapil, based on preclinical studies performed in the dy W/dy W and dy 2J/dy 2J mouse models. This phase 1 study enabled the collection of pulmonary and motor outcome measures and also provided the opportunity for investigating exploratory outcome measures including muscle ultrasound, muscle MRI and serum, and urine biomarker collection. Natural history studies, including a five-year prospective natural history and comparative outcome measures study in patients with LAMA2-RD, have helped to better delineate the natural history and identify viable outcome measures. Plans for further clinical trials for LAMA2-RDs are presently in progress, highlighting the necessity of identifying adequate, disease-relevant biomarkers, capable of reflecting potential therapeutic changes, in addition to refining the clinical outcome measures and time-to-event trajectory analysis of affected patients."

                "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders are often caused by heterogeneous mutations in large, structurally complex genes. Targeting compensatory modifier genes could be beneficial to improve disease phenotypes. Here we report a mutation-independent strategy to upregulate the expression of a disease-modifying gene associated with congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) using the CRISPR activation system in mice. MDC1A is caused by mutations in LAMA2 that lead to nonfunctional laminin-\u03b12, which compromises the stability of muscle fibres and the myelination of peripheral nerves. Transgenic overexpression of Lama1, which encodes a structurally similar protein called laminin-\u03b11, ameliorates muscle wasting and paralysis in mouse models of MDC1A, demonstrating its importance as a compensatory modifier of the disease1. However, postnatal upregulation of Lama1 is hampered by its large size, which exceeds the packaging capacity of vehicles that are clinically relevant for gene therapy. We modulate expression of Lama1 in the dy2j/dy2j mouse model of MDC1A using an adeno-associated virus (AAV9) carrying a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9), VP64 transactivators and single-guide RNAs that target the Lama1 promoter. When pre-symptomatic mice were treated, Lama1 was upregulated in skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves, which prevented muscle fibrosis and paralysis. However, for many disorders it is important to investigate the therapeutic window and reversibility of symptoms. In muscular dystrophies, it has been hypothesized that fibrotic changes in skeletal muscle are irreversible. However, we show that dystrophic features and disease progression were improved and reversed when the treatment was initiated in symptomatic dy2j/dy2j mice with apparent hindlimb paralysis and muscle fibrosis. Collectively, our data demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of CRISPR-dCas9-mediated upregulation of Lama1, which may enable mutation-independent treatment for all patients with MDC1A. This approach has a broad applicability to a variety of disease-modifying genes and could serve as a therapeutic strategy for many inherited and acquired diseases."

Previously it was shown that transgenic muscle-specific expression of \u03b1LNNd, a laminin \u03b31-binding linker protein that enables polymerization in defective laminins, selectively ameliorates the muscle abnormality in mouse disease models. Here, adeno-associated virus was used to deliver linker mini-genes to dystrophic dy2J/dy2J mice for expression of \u03b1LNNd in muscle, or \u03b1LNNd\u0394G2', a shortened linker, in muscle, nerve, and other tissues. Linker and laminin \u03b12 levels were higher in \u03b1LNNd\u0394G2'-treated mice. Both \u03b1LNNd- and \u03b1LNNd\u0394G2'-treated mice exhibited increased forelimb grip strength. Further, \u03b1LNNd\u0394G2'-treated mice achieved hind limb and all-limb grip strength levels approaching those of WT mice as well as ablation of hind limb paresis and contractures. This was accompanied by restoration of sciatic nerve axonal envelopment and myelination. Improvement of muscle histology was evident in the muscle-specific \u03b1LNNd-expressing mice but more extensive in the \u03b1LNNd\u0394G2'-expressing mice. The results reveal that an \u03b1LN linker mini-gene, driven by a ubiquitous promoter, is superior to muscle-specific delivery because of its higher expression that extends to the peripheral nerve. These studies support a potentially novel approach of somatic gene therapy."

Methods: Immortalized cell lines and mouse corneal endothelia were used to measure autophagy and lysosome associated protein expressions using Protein Simple Wes immunoassay. Autophagy and lysosome functions were examined in wild type (WT) and KO cells as well as animals treated with the mitochondrial ROS quencher MitoQ. Results: Even though autophagy activation was evident, autophagy flux was aberrant in Slc4a11 KO cells and corneal endothelium. Expression of lysosomal proteins and lysosomal mass were decreased along with reduced nuclear translocation of lysosomal master regulator, transcription factor EB (TFEB). MitoQ reversed aberrant lysosomal functions and TFEB nuclear localization in KO cells. MitoQ injections in KO animals reduced corneal edema and decreased the rate of endothelial cell loss. Conclusions: Mitochondrial ROS disrupts TFEB signaling causing lysosomal dysfunction with impairment of autophagy in Slc4a11 KO corneal endothelium. Our study is the first to identify the presence as well as cause of lysosomal dysfunction in an animal model of CHED, and to identify a potential therapeutic approach."

                "abstract": "Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy (TBCD) is an epithelial-stromal TGFBI dystrophy caused by mutations in the TGFBI (transforming growth factor beta induced) gene, though the underlying mechanisms and pathogenesis of TBCD are still obscure. The study identifies a novel mutation in the TGFBI gene (p.Gly623_His626del) in a TBCD pedigree. Characteristics of the typical vacuole formation, irregular corneal epithelial thickening and thinning, deposition of eosinophilic substances beneath the epithelium, and involvement of the anterior stroma were observed in this pedigree via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and histological staining. Tgfbi-p.Gly623_Tyr626del mouse models of TBCD were subsequently generated via CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and the above characteristics were further verified via TEM and histological staining. Lysosomal dysfunction and downregulation of differential expression protein CTSD (cathepsin D) were observed using LysoTracker Green DND-26 and proteomic analysis, respectively. Hence, lysosomal dysfunction probably leads to autophagic flux obstruction in TBCD; this was supported by enhanced LC3-II and SQSTM1 levels and decreased CTSD. TFEB (transcription factor EB) was prominently decreased in TBCD corneal fibroblasts and administration of ATP-competitive MTOR inhibitor torin 1 reversed this decline, resulting in the degradation of accumulated mut-TGFBI (mutant TGFBI protein) via the ameliorative lysosomal function and autophagic flux owing to elevated TFEB activity as measured by western blot, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. Transfected HEK 293 cells overexpressing human full-length WT-TGFBI and mut-TGFBI were generated to further verify the results obtained in human corneal fibroblasts. Amelioration of lysosome dysfunction may therefore have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of TBCD.Abbreviations AS-OCT: anterior segment optical coherence tomography; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; Cas9: CRISPR-associated protein 9; CLEAR: coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation; CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; CTSB: cathepsin B; CTSD: cathepsin D; CTSF: cathepsin F; CTSL: cathepsin L; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid; ECM: extracellular matrix; Fas1: fasciclin 1; FC: flow cytometry; GAPDH: glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GCD2: granular corneal dystrophy type 2; HE: hematoxylin and eosin; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; MT: mutation type; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; mut-TGFBI: mutant TGFBI protein; SD: standard deviation; TBCD: Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TGFBI: transforming growth factor beta induced; WT: wild type."

                "abstract": "Purpose: To elucidate the molecular events in solute carrier family 4 member 11 (SLC4A11)-deficient corneal endothelium that lead to the endothelial dysfunction that characterizes the dystrophies associated with SLC4A11 mutations, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy 4. Methods: Comparative transcriptomic analysis (CTA) was performed in primary human corneal endothelial cells (pHCEnC) and murine corneal endothelial cells (MCEnC) with normal and reduced levels of SLC4A11 (SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC) and Slc4a11 (Slc4a11-/- MCEnC), respectively. Validation of differentially expressed genes was performed using immunofluorescence staining of CHED corneal endothelium, as well as western blot and quantitative PCR analysis of SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC and Slc4a11-/- MCEnC. Functional analyses were performed to investigate potential functional changes associated with the observed transcriptomic alterations. Results: CTA revealed inhibition of cell metabolism and ion transport function as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, in SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC and Slc4a11-/- MCEnC. Co-localization of SNARE protein STX17 with mitochondria marker COX4 was observed in CHED corneal endothelium, as was activation of AMPK-p53/ULK1 in both SLC4A11 KD pHCEnC and Slc4a11-/- MCEnC, providing additional evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy. Reduced Na+-dependent HCO3- transport activity and altered NH4Cl-induced membrane potential changes were observed in Slc4a11-/- MCEnC. Conclusions: Reduced steady-state ATP levels and subsequent activation of the AMPK-p53 pathway provide a link between the metabolic functional deficit and transcriptome alterations, as well as evidence of insufficient ATP to maintain the Na+/K+-ATPase corneal endothelial pump as the cause of the edema that characterizes SLC4A11-associated corneal endothelial dystrophies."

Because lysosomes are derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi, we asked whether ER function is affected by mitochondrial ROS in Slc4a11 KO corneal endothelial cells. In mouse Slc4a11 -/- corneal endothelial tissue, we observed the presence of dilated ER and elevated expression of ER stress markers BIP and CHOP. Slc4a11 KO mouse corneal endothelial cells incubated with glutamine showed increased aggresome formation, BIP and GADD153, as well as reduced ER Ca2+ release as compared to WT. Induction of mitoROS by ETC inhibition also led to ER stress in WT cells. Treatment with the mitochondrial ROS quencher MitoQ, restored ER Ca2+ release and relieved ER stress markers in Slc4a11 KO cells in vitro. Systemic MitoQ also reduced BIP expression in Slc4a11 KO endothelium. We conclude that mitochondrial ROS can induce ER stress in corneal endothelial cells."

                "abstract": "Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal function. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO) mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia with TFEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we compared ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1 activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFEB nuclear translocation with a resultant increase in lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex after TBI.

Methods: We intercrossed H-2Kb-tsA58 mice (Immortomouse) expressing an IFN-\u03b3 dependent and temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen (tsTAg) with Slc4a11+/+ and Slc4a11-/- C57BL/6 mice. The growth characteristics of the cell lines was assessed by doubling time. Ion transport activities (Na+/H+ exchange, bicarbonate, lactate, and Slc4a11 ammonia transport) were analyzed by intracellular pH measurement. The metabolic status of the cell lines was assessed by analyzing TCA cycle intermediates via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: The immortalized Slc4a11+/+ and Slc4a11-/- mouse corneal endothelial cells (MCECs) remained proliferative through passage 49 and maintained similar active ion transport activity. As expected, proliferation was temperature sensitive and IFN-\u03b3 dependent. Slc4a11-/- MCECs exhibited decreased proliferative capacity, reduced NH3:H+ transport, altered expression of glutaminolysis enzymes similar to the Slc4a11-/- mouse, and reduced proportion of TCA cycle intermediates derived from glutamine with compensatory increases in glucose flux compared with Slc4a11+/+ MCECs. Conclusions: This is the first report of the immortalization of MCECs. Ion transport of the immortalized endothelial cells remains active, except for NH3:H+ transporter activity in Slc4a11-/- MCECs. Furthermore, Slc4a11-/- MCECs recapitulate the glutaminolysis defects observed in Slc4a11-/- mouse corneal endothelium, providing an excellent tool to study the pathogenesis of SLC4A11 mutations associated with corneal endothelial dystrophies and to screen potential therapeutic agents."

                "abstract": "Corneal endothelial dystrophy is a progressive disease with gradual loss of vision and characterized by degeneration and dysfunction of corneal endothelial cells. Mutations in SLC4A11, a Na+ dependent OH- transporter, cause congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) and Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), the two most common forms of endothelial degeneration. Along with genetic factors, oxidative stress plays a role in pathogenesis of several corneal diseases. In this study we looked into the role of SLC4A11 in antioxidant stress response in human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnC). We found increased expression of SLC4A11 in presence of oxidative stress. Depletion of SLC4A11 using targeted siRNA, caused an increase in reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c, lowered mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced cell viability during oxidative stress. Moreover, SLC4A11 was found to be necessary for NRF2 mediated antioxidant gene expression in HCEnC. On the other hand, over expression of SLC4A11 reduces reactive oxygen species levels and increases cell viability. Lastly, CHED tissue specimens show evidence of oxidative stress and reduced expression of NRF2. In conclusion, our data suggests a possible role of SLC4A11 in regulating oxidative stress, and might be responsible for both the etiology and treatment of corneal endothelial dystrophy."

The defective autophagic degradation of pathogenic mutant-TGFBIp has been shown in GCD2; however, its exact mechanisms are unknown. To address this, we investigated lysosomal functions using corneal fibroblasts. Levels of cathepsins K and L (CTSK and CTSL) were significantly decreased in GCD2 cells, but of cathepsins B and D (CTSB and CTSD) did not change. The maturation of the pro-enzymes to their active forms (CTSB, CTSK and CTSL) was inhibited in GCD2 cells. CTSL enzymes directly degraded both LC3 (autophagosomes marker) and mutant-TGFBIp. Exogenous CTSL expression dramatically reduced mutant-TGFBIp in GCD2 cells, but not TGFBIp in WT cells. An increased lysosomal pH and clustered lysosomal perinuclear position were found in GCD2 cells. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) levels were significantly reduced in GCD2 cells, compared to WT. Notably, exogenous TFEB expression improved mutant-TGFBIp clearance and lysosomal abnormalities in GCD2 cells. Taken together, lysosomal dysfunction in the corneal fibroblasts underlies the pathogenesis of GCD2, and TFEB has a therapeutic potential in the treatment of GCD2."

                "abstract": "Purpose: SLC4A11, an electrogenic H+ transporter, is found in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of corneal endothelium. However, the underlying mechanism of SLC4A11 targeting to mitochondria is unknown. Methods: The presence of mitochondrial targeting sequences was examined using in silico mitochondrial proteomic analyses. Thiol crosslinked peptide binding to SLC4A11 was screened by untargeted liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Direct protein interactions between SLC4A11 and chaperones were examined using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and proximity ligation assay. Knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of chaperones in human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) or mouse corneal endothelial cells (MCECs), ex vivo kidney, or HA-SLC4A11-transfected fibroblasts was performed to investigate the functional consequences of interfering with mitochondrial SLC4A11 trafficking. Results: SLC4A11 does not contain canonical N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that HSC70 and/or HSP90 are bound to HA-SLC4A11-transfected PS120 fibroblast whole-cell lysates or isolated mitochondria, suggesting trafficking through the chaperone-mediated carrier pathway. SLC4A11 and either HSP90 or HSC70 complexes are directly bound to the mitochondrial surface receptor, TOM70. Interference with this trafficking leads to dysfunctional mitochondrial glutamine catabolism and increased reactive oxygen species production. In addition, glutamine (Gln) use upregulated SLC4A11, HSP70, and HSP90 expression in whole-cell lysates or purified mitochondria of HCECs and HA-SLC4A11-transfected fibroblasts. Conclusions: HSP90 and HSC70 are critical in mediating mitochondrial SLC4A11 translocation in corneal endothelial cells and kidney. Gln promotes SLC4A11 import to the mitochondria, and the continuous oxidative stress derived from Gln catabolism induced HSP70 and HSP90, protecting cells against oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "Slc4a11 KO mice show significant corneal edema, altered endothelial morphology, and mitochondrial ROS at an early age without a decrease in endothelial cell density. We examined the differential gene expression profile between wild type (WT) and KO with the goal of finding pathways related to corneal endothelial metabolic, pump and barrier function that can explain the corneal edema. Freshly dissected Corneal Endothelium-Descemet's Membrane (CEDM) and cultured Mouse Corneal Endothelial Cells (MCEC) were obtained from WT and Slc4a11 KO mice. RNA sequencing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted activation, inhibition or differential regulation of several pathways. QPCR and Western analysis validated downregulation of Glycolytic enzymes, Mitochondrial complex components and Ion transporters. Functional testing revealed decreases in endothelial lactate production, Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR), glutaminolysis, and Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) of KO CEDM in the presence of Glutamine (Gln) that was not compensated by fatty acid oxidation. Stromal lactate was significantly elevated in KO along with decreased expression of MCT1 and MCT4 lactate transporters in endothelial cells. ATP levels were 2x higher in KO CEDM, concomitant with a 3-fold decrease in Na-K-ATPase activity and reduced basolateral membrane localization. Genes for cholesterol biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism and tight and adherens junctions were elevated. Alteration of tight junction structure and cortical cytoskeleton is evident in KO corneal endothelium with a significant increase in trans-endothelial fluorescein permeability. We conclude that Slc4a11 KO induces a coordinated decrease in glycolysis, glutaminolysis, lactate transport and Na-K-ATPase activity. These changes together with an altered barrier function cause an accumulation of stromal lactate in Slc4a11 KO mice leading to chronic corneal edema."

FECD can be influenced by environmental stressors and genetic conditions. However, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction for advancing FECD pathogenesis is not yet fully studied. Therefore, in the present study we sought to determine whether a combination of environmental stressors (ultraviolet-A (UVA) light and cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)) can induce mitochondrial dysfunction leading to FECD. We also investigated if MitoQ, a water-soluble antioxidant, can target mitochondrial dysfunction induced by UVA and CSC in human corneal endothelial cells mitigating FECD pathogenesis. We modeled the FECD by increasing exogenous oxidative stress with CSC (0.2%), UVA (25J/cm2) and a combination of UVA\u00a0+\u00a0CSC and performed a temporal analysis of their cellular and mitochondrial effects on HCEnC-21T immortalized cells in vitro before and after MitoQ (0.05\u00a0\u03bcM) treatment. Interestingly, we observed that a combination of UVA\u00a0+\u00a0CSC exposure increased mitochondrial ROS and fragmentation leading to a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and increased levels of cytochrome c release leading to apoptosis and cell death. MitoQ intervention successfully mitigated these effects and restored cell viability. The UVA\u00a0+\u00a0CSC model could be used to study stress induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, MitoQ can serve as a viable antioxidant in attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction, underscoring its potential as a molecular-focused treatment approach to combat FECD pathogenesis."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of mutations in SLC4A11 on cellular localization of the protein, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis due to oxidative stress. Mutations in SLC4A11 have been associated with 2 different forms of corneal endothelial dystrophy that lead to degeneration of the corneal endothelium, causing opacity of the cornea and gradual vision loss. METHODS: HEK 293 cells were transfected with wild-type SLC4A11 or mutants, Ser213Leu, Arg233Cys, Gly418Asp, and Thr584Lys, and exposed to oxidative stress. Cellular localization of the proteins was detected by confocal microscopy, whereas mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry and a colorimetric assay. Expressions of antioxidant genes were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Although wild-type SLC4A11 was localized on the cell membrane, mutant proteins were found diffused in the cytoplasm. Mutations in SLC4A11 caused an increase in generation of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction due to oxidative stress. NRF2, HO-1, and NQO expression decreased significantly, and a higher rate of apoptosis was detected in cells with mutant proteins under oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mutations in SLC4A11 cause retention of the protein in the cytoplasm and generate increased reactive oxygen species. We found that cells containing mutant SLC4A11 are more vulnerable to oxidative and mitochondrial damage, less able to overcome oxidative stress through the expression of sufficient levels of antioxidant genes, and are more prone to apoptotic death."

                "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer agent. However, DOX treatment increases patient susceptibility to dilated cardiomyopathy. DOX predisposes cardiomyocytes to insult by suppressing mitochondrial energy metabolism, altering calcium flux, and disrupting proteolysis and proteostasis. Prior studies have assessed the role of macroautophagy in DOX cardiotoxicity; however, limited studies have examined whether DOX mediates cardiac injury through dysfunctions in inter- and/or intra-lysosomal signaling events. Lysosomal signaling and function is governed by transcription factor EB (TFEB). In the present study, we hypothesized that DOX caused myocyte injury by impairing lysosomal function and signaling through negative regulation of TFEB. Indeed, we found that DOX repressed cellular TFEB expression, which was associated with impaired cathepsin proteolytic activity across in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of DOX cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that loss of TFEB was associated with reduction in macroautophagy protein expression, inhibition of autophagic flux, impairments in lysosomal cathepsin B activity, and activation of cell death. Restoration and/or activation of TFEB in DOX-treated cardiomyocytes prevented DOX-induced suppression of cathepsin B activity, reduced DOX-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, attenuated activation of caspase-3, and improved cellular viability. Collectively, loss of TFEB inhibits lysosomal autophagy, rendering cardiomyocytes susceptible to DOX-induced proteotoxicity and injury. Our data reveal a novel mechanism wherein DOX primes cardiomyocytes for cell death by depleting cellular TFEB."

                "abstract": "Oxidative stress dysfunction has recently been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Previously, we found that advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) in plasma were elevated in women with POI and had an adverse effect on granulosa cell proliferation. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of AOPPs on autophagy-lysosome pathway regulation in granulosa cells remains unclear. In this study, the effect of AOPPs on autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis and the underlying mechanisms were explored by a series of in vitro experiments in KGN and COV434 cell lines. AOPP-treated rat models were employed to determine the negative effect of AOPPs on the autophagy-lysosome systems in vivo. We found that increased AOPP levels activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and inhibited the autophagic response and lysosomal biogenesis in KGN and COV434 cells. Furthermore, scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with N-acetylcysteine and blockade of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin or via starvation alleviated the AOPP-induced inhibitory effects on autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, suggesting that these effects of AOPPs are ROS-mTOR dependent. The protein expression and nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), the key regulator of lysosomal and autophagic function, were also impaired by the AOPP-activated ROS-mTOR pathway. In addition, TFEB overexpression attenuated the AOPP-induced impairment of autophagic flux and lysosomal biogenesis in KGN and COV434 cells. Chronic AOPP stimulation in vivo also impaired autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis in granulosa cells of rat ovaries. The results highlight that AOPPs lead to impairment of autophagic flux and lysosomal biogenesis via ROS-mTOR-TFEB signaling in granulosa cells and participate in the pathogenesis of POI."

                "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical studies have long shown that exposure to high levels of heavy metals are associated with increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. It is widely accepted that autophagic dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders; however, the role of heavy metals in regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy is unclear. Here, we show that manganese (Mn) induces a decline in nuclear localization of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, leading to autophagic dysfunction in astrocytes of mouse striatum. We further show that Mn exposure suppresses autophagic-lysosomal degradation of mitochondria and induces accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria. Activation of autophagy by rapamycin or TFEB overexpression ameliorates Mn-induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in astrocytes, suggesting a causal relation between autophagic failure and mitochondrial dysfunction in Mn toxicity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Mn inhibits TFEB activity, leading to impaired autophagy that is causally related to mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for Mn in dysregulation of autophagy and identify TFEB as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate Mn toxicity.

VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) increased TFEB expression level and nuclear translocation. Utilizing genetically engineered EC-specific TFEB transgenic and KO (knockout) mice, we investigated the role of TFEB in postischemic angiogenesis in the mouse hindlimb ischemia model. We observed improved blood perfusion and increased capillary density in the EC-specific TFEB transgenic mice compared with the wild-type littermates. Furthermore, blood flow recovery was attenuated in EC-TFEB KO mice compared with control mice. In aortic ring cultures, the TFEB transgene significantly increased vessel sprouting, whereas TFEB deficiency impaired the vessel sprouting. In vitro, adenovirus-mediated TFEB overexpression promoted EC tube formation, migration, and survival, whereas siRNA-mediated TFEB knockdown had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, TFEB activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)-\u03b1 signaling and upregulated autophagy. Through inactivation of AMPK\u03b1 or inhibition of autophagy, we demonstrated that the AMPK\u03b1 and autophagy are necessary for TFEB to regulate angiogenesis in ECs. Finally, the positive effect of TFEB on AMPK\u03b1 activation and EC tube formation was mediated by TFEB-dependent transcriptional upregulation of MCOLN1 (mucolipin-1). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data demonstrate that TFEB is a positive regulator of angiogenesis through activation of AMPK\u03b1 and autophagy, suggesting that TFEB constitutes a novel molecular target for ischemic vascular disease."

                "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd), a highly ubiquitous heavy metal, is a well-known inducer of neurotoxicity. However, the mechanism underlying cadmium-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. In this study, we found that Cd inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and impairs lysosomal function by reducing the levels of lysosomal-associated membrane proteins, inhibiting lysosomal proteolysis and altering lysosomal pH, contributing to defects in autophagic clearance and subsequently leading to nerve cell death. In addition, Cd decreases transcription factor EB (TFEB) expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Cd induces the nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFEB target-gene expression, associated with compromised lysosomal function or a compensatory effect after the impairment of the autophagic flux. Notably, restoration of the levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein, lysosomal proteolysis, lysosomal pH and autophagic flux through Tfeb overexpression protects against Cd-induced neurotoxicity, and this protective effect is incompletely dependent on TFEB nuclear translocation. Moreover, gene transfer of the master autophagy regulator TFEB results in the clearance of toxic proteins and the correction of Cd-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. Our study is the first to demonstrate that Cd disrupts lysosomal function and autophagic flux and manipulation of TFEB signalling may be a therapeutic approach for antagonizing Cd-induced neurotoxicity."

                "abstract": "Purpose: SLC4A11 is a plasma membrane protein of corneal endothelial cells. Some mutations of the SLC4A11 gene result in SLC4A11 protein misfolding and failure to mature to the plasma membrane. This gives rise to some cases of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED). We screened ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for their ability to correct SLC4A11 folding defects. Methods: Five ophthalmic NSAIDs were tested for their therapeutic potential in some genetic corneal dystrophy patients. HEK293 cells expressing CHED and FECD-causing SLC4A11 mutants were grown on 96-well dishes in the absence or presence of NSAIDs. Ability of NSAIDs to correct mutant SLC4A11 cell-surface trafficking was assessed with a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay and by confocal microscopy. The ability of mutant SLC4A11-expressing cells to mediate water flux (SLC4A11 mediates water flux across the corneal endothelial cell basolateral membrane as part of the endothelial water pump) was measured upon treatment with ophthalmic NSAIDs. Results: BRET-assays revealed significant rescue of SLC4A11 mutants to the cell surface by 4 of 5 NSAIDs tested. The NSAIDs, diclofenac and nepafenac, were effective in moving endoplasmic reticulum-retained missense mutant SLC4A11 to the cell surface, as measured by confocal immunofluorescence. Among intracellular-retained SLC4A11 mutants, 20 of 30 had significant restoration of cell surface abundance upon treatment with diclofenac. Diclofenac restored mutant SLC4A11 water flux activity to the level of wild-type SLC4A11 in some cases. Conclusions: These results encourage testing diclofenac eye drops as a treatment for corneal dystrophy in patients whose disease is caused by some SLC4A11 missense mutations."

                "abstract": "Vps35 (vacuolar protein sorting 35) is a major component of retromer that selectively promotes endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of transmembrane proteins. Dysfunction of retromer is a risk factor for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, Vps35/retromer's function in the eye or the contribution of Vps35-deficiency to eye degenerative disorders remains to be explored. Here we provide evidence for a critical role of Vps35 in mouse corneal dystrophy. Vps35 is expressed in mouse and human cornea. Mouse cornea from Vps35 heterozygotes (Vps35+/-) show features of dystrophy, such as loss of both endothelial and epithelial cell densities, disorganizations of endothelial, stroma, and epithelial cells, excrescences in the Descemet membrane, and corneal edema. Additionally, corneal epithelial cell proliferation was reduced in Vps35-deficient mice. Intriguingly, cell surface targeting of SLC4A11, a membrane transport protein (OH- /H+ /NH3 /H2O) of corneal endothelium, whose mutations have been identified in patients with corneal dystrophy, was impaired in Vps35-deficient cells and cornea. Taken together, these results suggest that SLC4A11 appears to be a Vps35/retromer cargo, and Vps35-regulation of SLC4A11 trafficking may underlie Vps35/retromer regulation of corneal dystrophy."

In this study, we characterize the impact of CHED-/FECD4-associated SLC4A11 mutations on CEnC function and SLC4A11 protein localization by generating and comparing human CEnC (hCEnC) lines expressing wild type SLC4A11 (SLC4A11WT) or mutant SLC4A11 harboring CHED-/FECD4-associated SLC4A11 mutations (SLC4A11MU). SLC4A11WT and SLC4A11MU hCEnC lines were generated to express either SLC4A11 variant 2 (V2WT and V2MU) or variant 3 (V3WT and V3MU), the two major variants expressed in ex vivo hCEnC. Functional assays were performed to assess cell barrier, proliferation, viability, migration, and NH3-induced membrane conductance. We demonstrate SLC4A11-/- and SLC4A11MU hCEnC lines exhibited increased migration rates, altered proliferation and decreased cell viability compared to SLC4A11WT hCEnC. Additionally, SLC4A11-/- hCEnC demonstrated decreased cell-substrate adhesion and membrane capacitances compared to SLC4A11WT hCEnC. Induction with 10mM NH4Cl led SLC4A11WT hCEnC to depolarize; conversely, SLC4A11-/- hCEnC hyperpolarized and the majority of SLC4A11MU hCEnC either hyperpolarized or had minimal membrane potential changes following NH4Cl induction. Immunostaining of primary hCEnC and SLC4A11WT hCEnC lines for SLC4A11 demonstrated predominately plasma membrane staining with poor or partial colocalization with mitochondrial marker COX4 within a subset of punctate subcellular structures. Overall, our findings suggest CHED-associated SLC4A11 mutations likely lead to hCEnC dysfunction, and ultimately CHED, by interfering with cell migration, proliferation, viability, membrane conductance, barrier function, and/or cell surface localization of the SLC4A11 protein in hCEnC. Additionally, based on their similar subcellular localization and exhibiting similar cell functional profiles, protein isoforms encoded by SLC4A11 variant 2 and variant 3 likely have highly overlapping functional roles in hCEnC."

                "abstract": "The blockage of autophagic flux in chondrocytes has been considered as a major reason for the excessive cellular apoptosis and senescence in osteoarthritis (OA) development; however, the molecular mechanism and therapeutic strategy for interrupted autophagic flux is still not clear. Most recently, the transcription factor EB (TFEB) is identified as a master regulator for autophagic flux via initiating the expression of multiple autophagy-related genes and lysosomal biogenesis. This research was performed to confirm whether TFEB expression and activity are impacted in OA development and to confirm the effect of genetic up-regulation of TFEB on autophagic flux and cellular protection in the in vitro and in vivo models of OA. We demonstrated that the expression and nuclear localization of TFEB is decreased in human and mouse OA cartilage as well as in tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-treated chondrocytes. Applying lentivirus to transfect chondrocytes, we found that TFEB overexpression rescues the TBHP-induced the autophagic flux damage, lysosome dysfunction and protects chondrocyte against TBHP induced apoptosis and senescence; these protections of TFEB are diminished by chloroquine-medicated autophagy inhibition. Our destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) mouse OA model shows that TFEB overexpression ameliorates the surgery-induced cartilage degradation, restrains the apoptosis and senescence of chondrocyte, and enhances the autophagic flux. In summary, our study indicates that the activity of TFEB in chondrocyte is involved in OA development, also TFEB overexpression may be a promising strategy for OA treatment."

            "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, often associated with mutations in genes such as Smad4 and BMPR1A. This study explores the impact of Smad4 knock-out on the development of intestinal polyps using collaborative cross (CC) mice, a genetically diverse model. Our results reveal a significant increase in intestinal polyps in Smad4 knock-out mice across the entire population, emphasizing the broad influence of Smad4 on polyposis. Sex-specific analyses demonstrate higher polyp counts in knock-out males and females compared to their WT counterparts, with distinct correlation patterns. Line-specific effects highlight the nuanced response to Smad4 knock-out, underscoring the importance of genetic variability. Multimorbidity heat maps offer insights into complex relationships between polyp counts, locations, and sizes. Heritability analysis reveals a significant genetic basis for polyp counts and sizes, while machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbors and linear regression, identify key predictors, enhancing our understanding of juvenile polyposis genetics. Overall, this study provides new information on understanding the intricate genetic interplay in the context of Smad4 knock-out, offering valuable insights that could inform the identification of potential therapeutic targets for juvenile polyposis and related diseases."

                "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a clinically diagnosed hamartomatous polyposis syndrome that increases the risk of gastrointestinal cancer. Approximately 40%-50% of JPS is caused by a germline disease-causing variant (DCV) in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotype of DCV-negative JPS and compare it with DCV-positive JPS. Herein, we analyzed a cohort of 145 individuals with JPS from nine institutions, including both pediatric and adult centers. Data analyzed included age at diagnosis, family history, cancer history, need for colectomy/gastrectomy, and polyp number and location. Compared with DCV-positive JPS, DCV-negative JPS was associated with younger age at diagnosis (P < 0.001), lower likelihood of having a family history of JPS (P < 0.001), and a lower risk of colectomy (P = 0.032). None of the DCV-negative individuals had gastric or duodenal polyps, and polyp burden decreased after the first decade compared with DCV-positive JPS. Subgroup analysis between SMAD4 and BMPR1A carriers showed that SMAD4 carriers were more likely to have a family history of JPS and required gastrectomy. Taken together, these data provide the largest phenotypic characterization of individuals with DCV-negative JPS to date, showing that this group has distinct differences compared with JPS due to a SMAD4 or BMPR1A variant. Better understanding of phenotype and cancer risk associated with JPS both with and without a DCV may ultimately allow for individualized management of polyposis and cancer risk.Prevention Relevance: Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS) is a gastrointestinal cancer predisposition syndrome requiring lifelong surveillance, however there is limited data comparing individuals with and without a germline disease-causing variant in SMAD4 or BMPR1A Herein we show that individuals with JPS without an underlying disease-causing variant have distinct phenotypic differences including lack of upper gastrointestinal polyps and lower rates of a family history of JPS, suggesting that a different approach to management may be appropriate in this population."

                "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis (JP) is a rare familial syndrome characterized by the development of numerous hamartomatous polyps of the gastrointestinal tract and by an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers. It follows a pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance and is associated with germline variants of SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. Differential diagnosis may be difficult based on histology alone, due to morphological similarities to other familial syndromes. Here we report a case of familial JP diagnosed in a 50-years woman with a familial history positive for gastrointestinal cancers and other tumor types. The patient presented with severe iron deficiency anemia and showed numerous polyps in the stomach and jejunum according to endoscopy and imaging. She underwent an intra-gastric laparoscopic removal of the major gastric polyp, followed by jejunal exploration and resection of a segment with multiple neoformations. Histological examination revealed the presence of hamartomatous polyposis. Gastric and intestinal samples were analyzed with next-generation sequencing. Molecular analysis showed that the patient harbored a germline splicing site variant of SMAD4, c.1139\u2009+\u20093A\u2009>\u2009G, which was complemented by different somatic variants of the same gene in the different polyps. Immunohistochemistry for SMAD4 confirmed loss of protein expression in the polyps, with regular expression in normal cells. cDNA sequencing further confirmed the findings. We thus definitively diagnosed the woman as having JP thanks to an integrated approach based on histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis. The identified variants, all previously reported as variants of unknown significance, were classified as pathogenic as they complemented each other leading to SMAD4 loss."

                "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and cancer with a pathogenic SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation (1st-hit) being identified in about 40-50% of patients. Little is known, however, about the occurrence and nature of somatic alterations (2nd-hit) in SMAD4-/BMPR1A-related juvenile polyps. In this study, we screened 25 polyps from three patients carrying either a pathogenic SMAD4 (c.1244-1247delACAG) or BMPR1A (c.583C>T; p.Gln195*) germline mutation for somatic alterations. The SMAD4-related polyps were also analyzed for SMAD4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Despite comprehensive screening for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), mutations in the coding sequence, chromosomal rearrangements, and promoter methylation, no somatic alterations could be identified in 14 SMAD4-related polyps. SMAD4 protein expression, however, was lost in 8 (57%) of 14 juvenile polyps with 6 showing concomitant loss in both, the epithelial and stromal, compartments. In the BMPR1A-related polyps, five out of nine (56%) displayed LOH. Further analysis of selected polyps revealed that LOH was gene copy number neutral and had occurred in the epithelial compartment. The heterogeneity of genetic mutations and protein expression levels indicates that different modes of gene inactivation can be operational in SMAD4- and BMPR1A-related polyp formation. Our observation, that about half of BMPR1A-related polyps displayed LOH, predominantly in the epithelial compartment, is compatible with BMPR1A acting as a tumour suppressor gene. Still, it remains to be determined whether juvenile polyp development generally requires loss of BMPR1A expression or, as observed in some SMAD4-related polyps, can occur despite normal protein expression."

                "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple distinct juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The cumulative life-time risk of colorectal cancer is 39% and the relative risk is 34. Juvenile polyps have a distinctive histology characterized by an abundance of edematous lamina propria with inflammatory cells and cystically dilated glands lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium with reactive changes. Clinically, juvenile polyposis syndrome is defined by the presence of 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colorectum, juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract or any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history of juvenile polyposis. In about 50%-60% of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found. Both genes play a role in the BMP/TGF-beta signalling pathway. It has been suggested that cancer in juvenile polyposis may develop through the so-called \"landscaper mechanism\" where an abnormal stromal environment leads to neoplastic transformation of the adjacent epithelium and in the end invasive carcinoma. Recognition of this rare disorder is important for patients and their families with regard to treatment, follow-up and screening of at risk individuals. Each clinician confronted with the diagnosis of a juvenile polyp should therefore consider the possibility of juvenile polyposis syndrome. In addition, juvenile polyposis syndrome provides a unique model to study colorectal cancer pathogenesis in general and gives insight in the molecular genetic basis of cancer. This review discusses clinical manifestations, genetics, pathogenesis and management of juvenile polyposis syndrome."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Familial juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition in which patients develop hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps with malignant potential. Pathogenic germline mutations in both the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes involved in the transforming growth factor beta pathway account for 40% of cases of JPS. Genetic heterogeneity remains evident, as the balance of cases is not accounted for by mutations in these genes. The aim of this study was to determine the mutation responsible in a family with juvenile polyposis. METHODS: An Australian Caucasian family with juvenile polyposis have attended and followed surveillance plans through the Familial Bowel Cancer Clinic, The Royal Melbourne Hospital. A pedigree of the family was constructed with attention to the mixed phenotypic expression of polyps in affected members. Genetic testing for SMAD4 and BMPR1A mutations in germline DNA and linkage analysis to SMAD4, BMPR1A and 15q14 (CRAC1 locus) were performed. RESULTS: There were no pathogenic mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A. There was no linkage to SMAD4 or 15q14 (CRAC1 locus). Linkage analysis suggested a cryptic BMPR1A mutation or the presence of another gene in close proximity to the BMPR1A locus. Two additional candidate genes in the region of linkage (PTEN and MINPP1) were excluded. CONCLUSION: Most affected members of this Australian Caucasian family demonstrate a phenotype of mixed polyps: juvenile polyps, adenomas and/or hyperplastic polyps. Cloning of a potentially responsible gene closely linked to the BMPR1A locus or a cryptic mutation in BMPR1A may offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of JPS."

                "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is an inherited autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to the development of juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and it poses an increased risk of GI malignancy. Germline causative variants were identified in the SMAD4 gene in a subset (20%) of JPS cases. Most SMAD4 germline genetic variants published to date are missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. SMAD4 germline alterations predicted to result in aberrant splicing have rarely been reported. Here, we report two unrelated Italian families harboring two different SMAD4 intronic variants, c.424+5G>A and c.425-9A>G, which are clinically associated with colorectal cancer and/or juvenile GI polyps. In silico prediction analysis, in vitro minigene assays, and RT-PCR showed that the identified variants lead to aberrant SMAD4 splicing via the exonization of intronic nucleotides, resulting in a premature stop codon. This is expected to cause the production of a truncated protein. This study expands the landscape of SMAD4 germline genetic variants associated with GI polyposis and/or cancer. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of the functional characterization of SMAD4 splicing variants through RNA analysis, which can provide new insights into genetic disease variant interpretation, enabling tailored genetic counseling, management, and surveillance of patients with GI polyposis and/or cancer."

We present the description of SMAD4 mosaicism in a 30-year-old man who had caecum adenocarcinoma, 11 juvenile colon polyps and epistaxis since childhood. We conducted NGS polyposis and CRC panel analysis on DNA extracted from two polyps, revealing a likely pathogenic SMAD4 variant: NM_005359.5:c. 1600C>T, p.(Gln534*). This variant was then identified at a very low frequency on blood and normal colonic tissue, by targeted visualization of previously obtained NGS data. These findings support the presence of a likely pathogenic mosaic SMAD4 variant that aligns with the patient's phenotype. Given the relatively frequent occurrence of de novo SMAD4 mutations, somatic mosaicism could account for a significant proportion of sporadic JPS patients with unidentified pathogenic variants.

NF1 defects have been found in the only two cases exhaustively tested. Therefore, JLIHMP has been questioned as an independent, NF1-specific entity. Incidental associations between NF1 and gastrointestinal polyposes at risk for gastrointestinal carcinoma should not be overlooked, given their implications in terms of clinical surveillance. We describe two patients featuring JLIHMPs in clinically/genetically proven NF1, in the absence of SMAD4 and BMPR1A mutations. In one case, the intervening mucosa was markedly inflamed, unlike JPS.

We describe a family in which the proband (a 46-year old woman) had massive polyposis of the stomach-leading to surgery-with high-grade dysplasia at histology. Molecular analysis was carried out using Next Generation sequencing techniques with Miseq Illumina Platforms and a minimal coverage of 40 reads. In the proband, the analysis showed the presence of a truncating mutation in the SMAD4 gene (c.1213dupC, a variant previously associated with juvenile polyposis and Hereditary Hemorrhagic Teleangectasia). The same mutation was detected in two other members of the family (father and brother of the proband), who showed massive polypoid involvement of the stomach at gastroscopy. By taking the family history, subtle evidence of Hereditary Teleangectasia was found (nasal bleeding and arterovenous malformations) in the three gene carriers. Colonoscopy showed polyp occurrence in all three affected members with SMAD4 mutation, with prevalence of adenomatous lesions in one (father), of hamartomas in the brother, and of a mix of histological types in the proband. The main features of the family can be summarized as follows: (A) In hereditary juvenile polyposis, lesions of different histology can be detected at colonoscopy; (B) In the gene carriers of SMAD4 mutations, lesions of the stomach require careful surveillance and, when necessary, surgical interventions; (C) Signs and symptoms of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Teleangectasia should be suspected (and searched) in individuals with SMAD4 constitutional mutations."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by the development of multiple hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps. Here, we present a case of JPS with a mosaic variant in SMAD4. METHODS: Exome sequencing TRIO analysis, using germline DNA from the biological mother and father along with the index case (IC). RESULTS: A 46-year-old male with no family history of cancer presented with chronic iron deficiency anemia and was diagnosed with massive gastric polyposis (\u2265100 polyps). At the age of 59, he underwent a total gastrectomy, revealing numerous polyps occupying the entire gastric mucosa, including a 5\u2009cm gastric hyperplastic polyp with high-grade dysplasia and focal adenocarcinoma. TRIO analysis identified the c.386A>C p.(Asn129Thr) variant in the SMAD4 gene at an allele frequency (AF) of 22%, suggesting its mosaic origin. Subsequently, the variant was found in heterozygosity in the IC's son, who exhibited two subcentimeter polyps in the colon and seven inflammatory gastric polyps with gastric inflammatory areas and hyperplasia, suggesting that the c.386A>C p.(Asn129Thr) variant in SMAD4 segregated with the phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence supporting the classification of the c.386A>C p.(Asn129Thr) variant in SMAD4 as a likely pathogenic variant. This finding contributes to improved accuracy in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of JPS."

Genes with JPS-associated mutations and their correlation with the phenotype are currently unknown. Gastrointestinal endoscopy results of a 31-year-old female patient showed multiple polyps in the digestive tract, and the presence of juvenile polyps was confirmed by pathological examination. During follow-up, the patient underwent total gastrectomy and polypectomy several times. Five members of this family were diagnosed with JPS, of which two died and three survived. Full exon gene sequencing of eight members of this family revealed a SMAD4 (NM-005359.3) c.1035C\u2009>\u2009A (p.Cys345*) mutation. This mutation leads to premature codon termination, causing protein truncation. SMAD4 is a pathogenic gene associated with JPS. This is the first report of an association between the c.1035C\u2009>\u2009A mutation and JPS pathogenesis. Detection of JPS-related mutations in family members with a genetic predisposition for JPS is very important for genetic counselling, surgical intervention, long-term monitoring and follow-up, and drug treatment."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Menetrier's disease (MD) is a rare disease with unknown aetiology, characterized by hypertrophic folds within the fundus and body of the stomach. AIMS: We investigated mutations of the candidate genes SMAD4, BMPR1A, TGF-\u03b1, and PDX1 within a family with MD. METHODS: A large 4-generation family with MD was identified. This family had 5 cases of MD, 1 case of MD and juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) and 3 cases of JPS. Participants provided saliva for DNA extraction and completed a health questionnaire designed to assess conditions that may be found in patients with MD. Following pedigree analysis, we sequenced the coding regions of the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes and the regulatory regions of the TGF-\u03b1 and PDX1 genes in affected and non-affected family members. RESULTS: No mutations were identified in the sequenced regions of BMPR1A, TGF-\u03b1, or PDX1. A dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified in each of the subjects with JPS as well as in each of the subjects with MD. Although this mutation segregated with disease, there were also unaffected/undiagnosed carriers. CONCLUSION: The 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 is the cause of JPS and the likely cause of MD in a large family initially diagnosed with MD."

Germline mutations in two genes, SMAD4 and BMPR1A, have been identified to cause JPS. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a germline heterozygous missense variant (c.299G\u2009>\u2009A) in exon 3 BMPR1A gene in a family with juvenile polyposis. This variant was absent from the population database, and concluded as de novo compared with the parental sequencing. Further sequencing of the proband's children confirmed the segregation of this variant with the disease, while the variant was also predicted to have damaging effect based on online prediction tools. Therefore, this variant was classified as likely pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Germline genetic testing revealed a de novo germline missense variant in BMPR1A gene in a family with juvenile polyposis. Identification of the pathogenic variant facilitates the cancer risk management of at-risk family members, and endoscopic surveillance is recommended for mutation carriers."

METHODS: We investigated clinical features and genomic data of 7 extended seemingly unrelated families with a genomic deletion of the entire coding region of BMPR1A. We defined mutation size, mutation prevalence, and tumor pathogenesis using whole-genome sequencing, targeted genotyping, and haplotype analysis. RESULTS: Patients with JPS from 7 families of Bukharin Jewish ancestry carried a deletion of 429 kb, encompassing the BMPR1A coding sequence and 8 downstream genes. Haplotype analysis and testing controls identified this as a common founder mutation occurring in 1/124 individuals of Bukharin origin. Tumor testing did not demonstrate loss of heterozygosity. Among carriers, JPS was almost fully penetrant, but clinical features varied widely, ranging from mild to very severe, including pan-enteric polyps, gastritis, and colorectal, esophageal, and testicular cancer, and carriers with phenotypes, which would not have raised suspicion of JPS. DISCUSSION: The phenotype in this large cohort was extremely variable, although all carriers shared the same variant and the same genetic background. New observations include a preponderance of adenomatous rather than juvenile polyps, possible association with testicular cancer, and unexpected upper gastrointestinal involvement."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Juvenile polyps are distinct hamartomatous malformations of the gastrointestinal tract that may occur in the heritable juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) or sporadically. Histologically, juvenile polyps are characterized by a marked increase of the stromal cell compartment, but an epithelial phenotype has also been reported. JPS has an increased risk of colorectal cancer but sporadic juvenile polyps do not. In 50% to 60% of patients with JPS, a germline mutation of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway genes SMAD4 or BMPR1A is found. This study compares the histologic phenotype of juvenile polyps with a SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation and sporadic juvenile polyps. METHODS: Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained slides of 65 JPS polyps and 25 sporadic juvenile polyps were reviewed for histologic features and dysplasia. Systematic random crypt and stroma counts were obtained by count stereology, and a crypt-stroma ratio was determined. All polyps were subsequently categorized as type A (crypt-stroma ratio <1.00) or type B (crypt-stroma ratio \u22651.00), the latter referring to the epithelial phenotype. Cell cycle activity was assessed using immunohistochemistry ofthe proliferation marker Ki67, and mutation analysis was carried out for KRAS and APC to determine the involvement of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. RESULTS: Juvenile polyps with a SMAD4 germline mutation were predominantly type B, whereas type A was more common among juvenile polyps with a BMPR1A germline mutation. However, this distinction could not be ascribed to differences in cell cycle activity. Dysplasia was equally common in JPS polyps with either a SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation, in which the involvement of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence does not seem to play a distinct role. CONCLUSION: Juvenile polyps in the setting of JPS exhibit distinct phenotypes correlating with the underlying genetic defect."

METHODS: Mutation and phenotype analysis was used in 80 unrelated patients of whom 65 met the clinical criteria for JPS (typical JPS) and 15 were suspected to have JPS. RESULTS: By direct sequencing of the two genes, point mutations were identified in 30 patients (46% of typical JPS). Using MLPA, large genomic deletions were found in 14% of all patients with typical JPS (six deletions in SMAD4 and three deletions in BMPR1A). Mutation analysis of the PTEN gene in the remaining 41 mutation negative cases uncovered a point mutation in two patients (5%). SMAD4 mutation carriers had a significantly higher frequency of gastric polyposis (73%) than did patients with BMPR1A mutations (8%) (p<0.001); all seven cases of gastric cancer occurred in families with SMAD4 mutations. SMAD4 mutation carriers with gastric polyps were significantly older at gastroscopy than those without (p<0.001). In 22% of the 23 unrelated SMAD4 mutation carriers, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was also diagnosed clinically. The documented histologic findings encompassed a wide distribution of different polyp types, comparable with that described in hereditary mixed polyposis syndromes (HMPS). CONCLUSIONS: Screening for large deletions raised the mutation detection rate to 60% in the 65 patients with typical JPS. A strong genotype-phenotype correlation for gastric polyposis, gastric cancer, and HHT was identified, which should have implications for counselling and surveillance. Histopathological results in hamartomatous polyposis syndromes must be critically interpreted."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, questionnaire-based European multicenter survey on and established a cohort of SMAD4/BMPR1A pathogenic variant carriers from the medical literature. RESULTS: We analyzed questionnaire-based data on 221 JPS patients (126 kindreds) from ten European centers and retrieved literature-based information on 473 patients. Compared with BMPR1A carriers, SMAD4 carriers displayed anemia twice as often (58% vs. 26%), and exclusively showed overlap symptoms with hemorrhagic telangiectasia (32%) and an increased prevalence (39% vs. 13%) of gastric juvenile polyps. Cancer, reported in 15% of JPS patients (median age 41 years), mainly occurred in the colorectum (overall: 62%, SMAD4: 58%, BMPR1A: 88%) and the stomach (overall: 21%; SMAD4: 27%, BMPR1A: 0%).

Juvenile polyposis syndrome patients with SMAD4 mutations develop cardiovascular events, whereas those with BMPR1A usually do not. Analysis of genetic mutations in JPS patients can be helpful in devising suitable strategies for medical management. In this study, we demonstrate the pathogenicity of a novel intronic mutation in BMPR1A using mRNA extracted from colonic mucosa of a boy with JPS. METHODS: Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood and total RNA isolated from the colonic mucosa were used for DNA sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, respectively. RESULTS: A 13-year-old boy, with no previous medical history, presented to the hospital complaining of bloody stools. Colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps in the colon, and the resected polyps were compatible with juvenile polyps. Sequencing analysis revealed a novel intronic mutation (c.778+5G>C) in BMPR1A. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of RNA extracted from the colonic mucosa showed an aberrant splicing form of BMPR1A. Trio analysis showed that his mother also had the same BMPR1A mutation. She was diagnosed with cancer of the cecum and polyposis of the colon at the age of 41. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the presence of a novel BMPR1A intronic mutation that exhibits splicing abnormality in a family with JPS. Further research and development will help elucidate the genotype-phenotype relationship in JPS."

                "abstract": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare precancerous condition that confers an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant. JPS should be clinically suspected when the other hamartomatous polyposis syndromes are excluded (i.e., Peutz- Jeghers and Cowden), in presence of numerous juvenile polyps in the colorectum or in other GI locations. Among the syndromic features, JPS can present with concomitant extra-intestinal manifestations, above all cutaneous manifestations such as telangiectasia, pigmented nevi, and skeletal stigmata. Pathogenic germline variants of either BMPR1A or SMAD4 cause the syndrome. In JPS a cumulative risk of CRC of 39-68% has been estimated. The oncological risk justifies and imposes prevention strategies that aim at the cancer risk reduction through endoscopic screening, as recommended by international scientific societies. The aim of this review is to summarize clinical and genetic features of JPS and to elucidate the steps of the clinical management from diagnosis to surveillance."

            "abstract": "Purpose: Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is an incurable inherited retinal disorder characterized by an ON-bipolar cell (ON-BC) defect. GRM6 mutations are the third most prevalent cause of cCSNB. The Grm6-/- mouse model mimics the human phenotype, showing no b-wave in the electroretinogram (ERG) and a loss of mGluR6 and other proteins of the same cascade at the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Our aim was to restore protein localization and function in Grm6-/- adult mice targeting specifically ON-BCs or the whole retina. Methods: Adeno-associated virus-encoding Grm6 under two different promoters (GRM6-Grm6 and CAG-Grm6) were injected intravitreally in P15 Grm6-/- mice. ERG recordings at 2 and 4 months were performed in Grm6+/+, untreated and treated Grm6-/- mice. Similarly, immunolocalization studies were performed on retinal slices before or after treatment using antibodies against mGluR6, TRPM1, GPR179, RGS7, RGS11, G\u03b25, and dystrophin. Results: Following treatment, mGluR6 was localized to the dendritic tips of ON-BCs when expressed with either promoter. The relocalization efficiency in mGluR6-transduced retinas at the OPL was 2.5% versus 11% when the GRM6-Grm6 and CAG-Grm6 were used, respectively. Albeit no functional rescue was seen in ERGs, relocalization of TRPM1, GPR179, and G\u03b25 was also noted using both constructs. The restoration of the localization of RGS7, RGS11, and dystrophin was more obvious in retinas treated with GRM6-Grm6 than in retinas treated with CAG-Grm6. Conclusions: Our findings show the potential of treating cCSNB with GRM6 mutations; however, it appears that the transduction rate must be improved to restore visual function."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1) is characterized by loss of night vision due to a defect in the retinal ON-bipolar cells (BCs). Mutations in GPR179, encoding the G-protein-coupled receptor 179, have been found in CSNB1 patients. In the mouse, GPR179 is localized to the tips of ON-BC dendrites. In this study we determined the ultrastructural localization of GPR179 in human retina and determined the functional consequences of mutations in GPR179 in patients and mice. METHODS: The localization of GRP179 was analyzed in postmortem human retinas with immunohistochemistry. The functional consequences of the loss of GPR179 were analyzed with standard and 15-Hz flicker ERG protocols. RESULTS: In the human retina, GPR179 is localized on the tips of ON-BC dendrites, which invaginate photoreceptors and terminate juxtaposed to the synaptic ribbon. The 15-Hz flicker ERG abnormalities found in patients with mutations in GPR179 more closely resemble those from patients with mutations in either TRPM1 or NYX than in GRM6. 15-Hz flicker ERG abnormalities of Gpr179(nob5) and Grm6(nob3) mice were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: GRP179 is expressed on dendrites of ON-BCs, indicating that GRP179 is involved in the ON-BCs' signaling cascade. The similarities of 15-Hz flicker ERGs noted in GPR179 patients and NYX or TRPM1 patients suggest that the loss of GPR179 leads to the loss or closure of TRPM1 channels. The difference between the 15-Hz flicker ERGs of mice and humans indicates the presence of important species differences in the retinal activity that this signal represents."

One type of CSNB is associated with defects in genes (NYX, GRM6, TRPM1, GPR179, and LRIT3) involved in the mGluR6 signaling cascade at the ON-BC dendritic tips. We have previously characterized a canine model of LRIT3-CSNB and demonstrated short-term safety and efficacy of an ON-BC targeting AAV-LRIT3 (AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE) gene therapy. Herein, we demonstrate long-term functional recovery and molecular restoration following subretinal injection of the ON-BC targeting AAV-LRIT3 vector in all eight treated eyes for up to 32\u00a0months. Following subretinal administration of the therapeutic vector, expression of the LRIT3 transgene, as well as restoration of mGluR6 signaling cascade member TRPM1, were confirmed in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the treated area. However, further investigation of the transgene LRIT3 transcript expression by RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) revealed off-target expression in non-BCs including the photoreceptors, inner nuclear, and ganglion cell layers, despite the use of a mutant AAVK9#4 capsid and an improved mGluR6 promoter designed to specifically transduce and promote expression in ON-BCs. While the long-term therapeutic potential of AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE is promising, we highlight the necessity for further optimization of AAV-LRIT3 therapy in the canine CSNB model prior to its clinical application."

We report here that mutations in GPR179, encoding an orphan G protein receptor, underlie a form of autosomal-recessive cCSNB. The Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mouse model was initially discovered by the absence of the ERG b-wave, a component that reflects depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) function. We performed genetic mapping, followed by next-generation sequencing of the critical region and detected a large transposon-like DNA insertion in Gpr179. The involvement of GPR179 in DBC function was confirmed in zebrafish and humans. Functional knockdown of gpr179 in zebrafish led to a marked reduction in the amplitude of the ERG b-wave. Candidate gene analysis of GPR179 in DNA extracted from patients with cCSNB identified GPR179-inactivating mutations in two patients. We developed an antibody against mouse GPR179, which robustly labeled DBC dendritic terminals in wild-type mice. This labeling colocalized with the expression of GRM6 and was absent in Gpr179(nob5/nob5) mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that GPR179 plays a critical role in DBC signal transduction and expands our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate normal rod vision."

Since the disease is non-degenerative and stable, treatment could theoretically be administrated at any time in life, making it a promising target for gene therapy. Until now, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated therapies lead to significant functional improvements only in newborn cCSNB mice.

LRIT3 localizes in the outer plexiform layer and is crucial for TRPM1 localization at the dendritic tips of ON-BCs and the electroretinogram (ERG)-b-wave. AAV2-7m8-Lrit3 intravitreal injections were performed targeting either ON-BCs, photoreceptors (PRs), or both. Protein localization of LRIT3 and TRPM1 at the rod-to-rod BC synapse, functional rescue of scotopic responses, and ON-responses detection at the ganglion cell level were achieved in a few mice when ON-BCs alone or both PRs and ON-BCs, were targeted. More importantly, a significant number of treated adult Lrit3 -/- mice revealed an ERG b-wave recovery\u00a0under scotopic conditions, improved optomotor responses, and on-time ON-responses at the ganglion cell level when PRs were targeted.

                "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) effectively targets therapeutic genes to photoreceptors, pigment epithelia, M\u00fcller glia and ganglion cells of the retina. To date, no one has shown the ability to correct, with gene replacement, an inherent defect in bipolar cells (BCs), the excitatory interneurons of the retina. Targeting BCs with gene replacement has been difficult primarily due to the relative inaccessibility of BCs to standard AAV vectors. This approach would be useful for restoration of vision in patients with complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1), where signaling through the ON BCs is eliminated due to mutations in their G-protein-coupled cascade genes. For example, the majority of CSNB1 patients carry a mutation in nyctalopin (NYX), which encodes a protein essential for proper localization of the TRPM1 cation channel required for ON BC light-evoked depolarization. As a group, CSNB1 patients have a normal electroretinogram (ERG) a-wave, indicative of photoreceptor function, but lack a b-wave due to defects in ON BC signaling. Despite retinal dysfunction, the retinas of CSNB1 patients do not degenerate. The Nyx(nob) mouse model of CSNB1 faithfully mimics this phenotype. Here, we show that intravitreally injected, rationally designed AAV2(quadY-F+T-V) containing a novel 'Ple155' promoter drives either GFP or YFP_Nyx in postnatal Nyx(nob) mice. In treated Nyx(nob) retina, robust and targeted Nyx transgene expression in ON BCs partially restored the ERG b-wave and, at the cellular level, signaling in ON BCs. Our results support the potential for gene delivery to BCs and gene replacement therapy in human CSNB1. "

                "abstract": "Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a non-progressive, clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease of impaired night vision. We report a naturally-occurring, stationary, autosomal recessive phenotype in beagle dogs with normal daylight vision but absent night vision. Affected dogs had normal retinas on clinical examination, but showed no detectable rod responses. They had \"negative-type\" mixed rod and cone responses in full-field ERGs. Their photopic long-flash ERGs had normal OFF-responses associated with severely reduced ON-responses. The phenotype is similar to the Schubert-Bornschein form of complete CSNB in humans. Homozygosity mapping ruled out most known CSNB candidates as well as CACNA2D4 and GNB3. Three remaining genes were excluded based on sequencing the open reading frame and intron-exon boundaries (RHO, NYX), causal to a different form of CSNB (RHO) or X-chromosome (NYX, CACNA1F) location. Among the genes expressed in the photoreceptors and their synaptic terminals, and mGluR6 cascade and modulators, reduced expression of GNAT1, CACNA2D4 and NYX was observed by qRT-PCR in both carrier (n = 2) and affected (n = 2) retinas whereas CACNA1F was down-regulated only in the affecteds. Retinal morphology revealed normal cellular layers and structure, and electron microscopy showed normal rod spherules and synaptic ribbons. No difference from normal was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for antibodies labeling rods, cones and their presynaptic terminals. None of the retinas showed any sign of stress. Selected proteins of mGluR6 cascade and its modulators were examined by IHC and showed that PKC\u03b1 weakly labeled the rod bipolar somata in the affected, but intensely labeled axonal terminals that appeared thickened and irregular. Dendritic terminals of ON-bipolar cells showed increased Go\u03b1 labeling. Both PKC\u03b1 and Go\u03b1 labeled the more prominent bipolar dendrites that extended into the OPL in affected but not normal retinas. Interestingly, RGS11 showed no labeling in the affected retina. Our results indicate involvement of a yet unknown gene in this canine model of complete CSNB. "

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: At an early age, the retinoschisin knockout (Rs1-KO) mouse retina has progressive photoreceptor degeneration with severe disruption of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) that decreases at older ages. The electroretinogram (ERG) undergoes parallel changes. The b-wave amplitude from bipolar cells is reduced disproportionately to the photoreceptor a-wave at young but not at older ages. The protein expression and morphology of the OPL in Rs1-KO mice was investigated at different ages, to explore the role of the synaptic layer in these ERG changes. METHODS: Retinas of wild-type (Wt) and Rs1-KO mice from postnatal day (P)7 to 12 months were evaluated by light and electron microscopy (EM) and biochemistry. PSD95 (postsynaptic density protein), mGluR6 (metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6), retinoschisin (Rs1), the M\u00fcller cell proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS), the bipolar cell marker protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), and the horizontal cell marker calbindin were localized by immunofluorescence and immuno-EM. Levels of PSD95 and mGluR6 were determined by quantitative Western blot. Rs1-KO mice treated by intravitreous injection of rAAV(2/2)-CMV-Rs1 in one eye at P14 were evaluated at 8 months by full-field scotopic ERG responses and retinal immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Rs1 was associated with the outer surface of synaptic membranes in wild-type (Wt) retinas. PSD95 and mGluR6 were juxtaposed in the OPL of the Rs1-KO retinas by P14, implying that synaptic structures are formed. Light microscopic retinal morphology was similar in Wt and Rs1-KO at P14, but by P21, the OPL was disrupted in Rs1-KO, and some PSD95 and mGluR6 was mislocalized in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). GFAP expression spanned all retinal layers. EM showed synaptic structures adjacent to photoreceptor nuclei. PSD95 and mGluR6 levels were normal at 1 month on Western blot but declined to 59% (P < 0.001) and 55% (P < 0.05) of Wt, respectively, by 4 months. Levels thereafter showed no further reduction out to 12 months. Eyes injected with AAV-Rs1 were studied at 8 months by immunohistochemistry and had higher expression of PSD95 and mGluR6 and less GFAP expression compared with fellow untreated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: In the Rs1-KO mouse, retinal layer formation and synaptic protein expression in the OPL is normal up to P14, implying normal development of synaptic connections. Aberrant localization of synaptic proteins by P21 indicates that displacement of developing and/or mature synapses contributes to the b-wave reduction at young ages, when photoreceptor numbers and synaptic protein levels are normal. The subsequent decline in PSD95 and mGluR6 between 1 and 12 months in Rs1-KO retina mirrors the course of b-wave change and provides evidence of causal relationship between the ERG and OPL changes. These findings and the improved structural integrity of the OPL and b-wave amplitude after Rs1 gene transfer therapy provide a cellular and molecular basis for interpreting the changes in retinal signaling in this model."

                "abstract": "Mutations in LRIT3 lead to complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). The exact role of LRIT3 in ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade remains to be elucidated. Recently, we have characterized a novel mouse model lacking Lrit3 [no b-wave 6, (Lrit3(nob6/nob6) )], which displays similar abnormalities to patients with cCSNB with LRIT3 mutations. Here we compare the localization of components of the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade in wild-type and Lrit3(nob6/nob6) retinal sections by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. An anti-LRIT3 antibody was generated. Immunofluorescent staining of LRIT3 in wild-type mice revealed a specific punctate labeling in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), which was absent in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice. LRIT3 did not co-localize with ribeye or calbindin but co-localized with mGluR6. TRPM1 staining was severely decreased at the dendritic tips of all depolarizing bipolar cells in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice. mGluR6, GPR179, RGS7, RGS11 and G\u03b25 immunofluorescence was absent at the dendritic tips of cone ON-bipolar cells in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice, while it was present at the dendritic tips of rod bipolar cells. Furthermore, peanut agglutinin (PNA) labeling was severely reduced in the OPL in Lrit3(nob6/nob6) mice. This study confirmed the localization of LRIT3 at the dendritic tips of depolarizing bipolar cells in mouse retina and demonstrated the dependence of TRPM1 localization on the presence of LRIT3. As tested components of the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade and PNA revealed disrupted localization, an additional function of LRIT3 in cone synapse formation is suggested. These results point to a possibly different regulation of the mGluR6 signaling cascade between rod and cone ON-bipolar cells. "

Mutations in GRM6 lead to DBC dysfunction and underlie the human condition autosomal recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness. Mouse mutants for Grm6 are important models for this condition. Here we report a new Grm6 mutant, identified in an electroretinogram (ERG) screen of mice maintained at The Jackson Laboratory. The Grm6nob8 mouse has a reduced-amplitude b-wave component of the ERG, which reflects light-evoked DBC activity. Sequencing identified a missense mutation that converts a highly conserved methionine within the ligand binding domain to leucine (p.Met66Leu). Consistent with prior studies of Grm6 mutant mice, the laminar size and structure in the Grm6nob8 retina were comparable to control. The Grm6nob8 phenotype is distinguished from other Grm6 mutants that carry a null allele by a reduced but not absent ERG b-wave, decreased but present expression of mGluR6 at DBC dendritic tips, and mislocalization of mGluR6 to DBC somas. Consistent with a reduced but not absent b-wave, there were a subset of retinal ganglion cells whose responses to light onset have times to peak within the range of those in control retinas. These data indicate that the p.Met66Leu mutant mGluR6 is trafficked less than control. However, the mGluR6 that is localized to the DBC dendritic tips is able to initiate DBC signal transduction. The Grm6nob8 mouse extends the Grm6 allelic series and will be useful for elucidating the role of mGluR6 in DBC signal transduction and in human disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article describes a mouse model of the human disease complete congenital stationary night blindness in which the mutation reduces but does not eliminate GRM6 expression and bipolar cell function, a distinct phenotype from that seen in other Grm6 mouse models."

                "abstract": "Purpose: The Grm6nob8 mouse carries a missense mutation in the Grm6 gene (p.Met66Leu), and exhibits a reduced b-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG), abnormal localization of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6) to the depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) soma, and a reduced level of mGluR6 at the DBC dendritic tips. Although the underlying mechanism remains unknown, one possible explanation is that DBCs cannot efficiently traffic the mutant mGluR6. In that scenario, reducing the total amount of mutant mGluR6 protein might normalize localization, and thus, improve the ERG phenotype as well. The second purpose of this study was to determine whether the abnormal cellular distribution of mutant mGluR6 in Grm6nob8 retinas might induce late onset DBC degeneration. Methods: We crossed Grm6nob8 animals with Grm6nob3 mice, which carry a null mutation in Grm6, to generate Grm6nob3/nob8 compound heterozygotes. We used western blotting to measure the total mGluR6 content, and immunohistochemistry to document mGluR6 localization within DBCs. In addition, we examined outer retinal function with ERG and retinal architecture in vivo with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Results: The retinal content of mGluR6 was reduced in the retinas of the Grm6nob3/nob8 compound heterozygotes compared to the Grm6nob8 homozygotes. The cellular distribution of mGluR6 in the Grm6nob3/nob8 compound heterozygotes matched that of the Grm6nob8 homozygotes, with extensive expression throughout the DBC cell body and limited expression at the DBC dendritic tips. The dark-adapted ERG b-waves of the Grm6nob3/nob8 mice were reduced in comparison to those of the Grm6nob8 homozygotes at postnatal day 21 and 28. The overall ERG waveforms obtained from 4- through 68-week old Grm6nob8 mice were in general agreement for dark- and light-adapted conditions. The maximum response and sensitivity of the dark-adapted ERG b-wave did not change statistically significantly with age. SD-OCT revealed the maintained laminar structure of the retina, including a clear inner nuclear layer (INL) at each age examined (from 11 to 57 weeks old), although the INL in the mice older than 39 weeks of age was somewhat thinner than that seen at 11 weeks. Conclusions: Mislocalization of mutant mGluR6 is not normalized by reducing the total mGluR6. Mislocalized mutant mGluR6 does not trigger substantial loss of DBCs."

The role of the corresponding protein in the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade remains to be elucidated. Here we genetically and functionally characterize a commercially available Lrit3 knock-out mouse, a model to study the function and the pathogenic mechanism of LRIT3. We confirm that the insertion of a Bgeo/Puro cassette in the knock-out allele introduces a premature stop codon, which presumably codes for a non-functional protein. The mouse line does not harbor other mutations present in common laboratory mouse strains or in other known cCSNB genes. Lrit3 mutant mice exhibit a so-called no b-wave (nob) phenotype with lacking or severely reduced b-wave amplitudes in the scotopic and photopic electroretinogram (ERG), respectively. Optomotor tests reveal strongly decreased optomotor responses in scotopic conditions. No obvious fundus auto-fluorescence or histological retinal structure abnormalities are observed. However, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) reveals thinned inner nuclear layer and part of the retina containing inner plexiform layer, ganglion cell layer and nerve fiber layer in these mice. To our knowledge, this is the first time that SD-OCT technology is used to characterize an animal model for CSNB. This phenotype is noted at 6 weeks and at 6 months. The stationary nob phenotype of mice lacking Lrit3, which we named nob6, confirms the findings previously reported in patients carrying LRIT3 mutations and is similar to other cCSNB mouse models. This novel mouse model will be useful for investigating the pathogenic mechanism(s) associated with LRIT3 mutations and clarifying the role of LRIT3 in the ON-bipolar cell signaling cascade. "

Using a cCSNB mouse model lacking Lrit3 (nob6), we recently have shown that LRIT3 has a role in the correct localization of TRPM1 (transient receptor potential melastatin 1) to the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells (BCs), contacting both rod and cone photoreceptors. Furthermore, postsynaptic clustering of other mGluR6 cascade components is selectively eliminated at the dendritic tips of cone ON-BCs. The purpose of this study was to further define the role of LRIT3 in structural and functional organization of cone synapses. Methods: Exhaustive electroretinogram analysis was performed in a patient with LRIT3 mutations. Multielectrode array recordings were performed at the level of retinal ganglion cells in nob6 mice. Targeting of GluR1 and GluR5 at the dendritic tips of OFF-BCs in nob6 retinas was assessed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. The ultrastructure of photoreceptor synapses was evaluated by electron microscopy in nob6 mice. Results: The patient with LRIT3 mutations had a selective ON-BC dysfunction with relatively preserved OFF-BC responses. In nob6 mice, complete lack of ON-pathway function with robust, yet altered signaling processing in OFF-pathways was detected. Consistent with these observations, molecules essential for the OFF-BC signaling were normally targeted to the synapse. Finally, synaptic contacts made by ON-BC but not OFF-BC neurons with the cone pedicles were disorganized without ultrastructural alterations in cone terminals, horizontal cell processes, or synaptic ribbons. Conclusions: These results suggest that LRIT3 is likely involved in coordination of the transsynaptic communication between cones and ON-BCs during synapse formation and function."

This study further defined the exact site of Gpr179 expression and its protein localization in human retina and elucidated the pathogenic mechanism of the reported missense and splice site mutations. METHODS: RNA in situ hybridization was performed with mouse retinal sections. A commercially available antibody was validated with GPR179-overexpressing COS-1 cells and applied to human retinal sections. Live-cell extracellular staining along with subsequent intracellular immunolocalization and ELISA studies were performed using mammalian cells overexpressing wild-type or missense mutated GPR179. Wild-type and splice site-mutated mini-gene constructs were transiently transfected, and RNA was extracted. RT-PCR-amplified products were cloned, and Sanger sequenced. RESULTS: Mouse Gpr179 transcript was expressed in the upper part of the inner nuclear layer, and the respective human protein localized at the dendritic tips of bipolar cells in human retina. The missense mutations p.Tyr220Cys, p.Gly455Asp, and p.His603Tyr led to severely reduced cell surface localization, whereas p.Asp126His did not. The mutated splice donor site altered GPR179 splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the site of expression and protein localization of human and mouse GPR179 is similar to that of other proteins implicated in cCSNB. For most of the mutations identified so far, loss of the GPR179 protein function seems to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism leading to this form of cCSNB."

This disorder is due to a signal transmission defect from rod photoreceptors to adjacent bipolar cells in the retina. Two forms can be distinguished clinically, complete CSNB (cCSNB) or incomplete CSNB; the two forms are distinguished on the basis of the affected signaling pathway. Mutations in NYX, GRM6, and TRPM1, expressed in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) lead to disruption of the ON-bipolar cell response and have been seen in patients with cCSNB.

Additional screening with Sanger sequencing of 40 patients identified three other cCSNB patients harboring additional allelic mutations in GPR179.

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: The retinal ON-bipolar cell (ON-BPC) light response is initiated upon deactivation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6 and the G protein Go. G protein-based signaling cascades are typically accelerated by interaction of the G protein alpha subunit with a member of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein family. The goal of this study was to determine whether RGS7 and/or -11 serve this function in retinal ON-BPCs. METHODS: Retinas from mice lacking RGS11 (RGS11(-/-)), or with a deletion mutation in RGS7 (RGS7(Delta/Delta)), or both, were compared to wild-type (WT) by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The retinal light response was measured with the electroretinogram (ERG). The kinetics of simulated light responses from individual rod bipolar cells were recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. RESULTS: Levels of the R7 RGS interaction partners, Gbeta5 and R9AP, were reduced in the outer plexiform layer of the RGS11(-/-) and RGS7(Delta/Delta)/RGS11(-/-) mice. ERG recordings demonstrated a delay in the rising phase of the ERG b-wave, larger photopic b-wave amplitudes, and increased scotopic threshold response sensitivity in the RGS11(-/-) and RGS7(Delta/Delta)/RGS11(-/-) mice. The ERG measured from the RGS7(Delta/Delta) retina was normal. Patch-clamp recordings of chemically simulated light responses of rod BPCs revealed a 25-ms delay in the onset of the ON-BPC response in the RGS7(Delta/Delta)/RGS11(-/-) mouse compared with the WT. CONCLUSIONS: RGS11 plays a role in the deactivation of Galphao, which precedes activation of the depolarizing current in ON-BPCs. RGS7 must also serve a role as changes in RGS7(Delta/Delta)/RGS11(-/-) mice were greater than those in RGS11(-/-) mice."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid precursor protein knockout mice (APP-KO) have impaired differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells. APP is part of a gene family and its paralogue amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) has both shared as well as distinct expression patterns to APP, including in the retina. Given the impact of APP in the retina we investigated how APLP2 expression affected the retina using APLP2 knockout mice (APLP2-KO). RESULTS: Using histology, morphometric analysis with noninvasive imaging technique and electron microscopy, we showed that APLP2-KO retina displayed abnormal formation of the outer synaptic layer, accompanied with greatly impaired photoreceptor ribbon synapses in adults. Moreover, APLP2-KO displayed a significant decease in ON-bipolar, rod bipolar and type 2 OFF-cone bipolar cells (36, 21 and 63\u00a0%, respectively). Reduction of the number of bipolar cells was accompanied with disrupted dendrites, reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 at the dendritic tips and alteration of axon terminals in the OFF laminae of the inner plexiform layer. In contrast, the APP-KO photoreceptor ribbon synapses and bipolar cells were intact. The APLP2-KO retina displayed numerous phenotypic similarities with the congenital stationary night blindness, a non-progressive retinal degeneration disease characterized by the loss of night vision. The pathological phenotypes in the APLP2-KO mouse correlated to altered transcription of genes involved in pre- and postsynatic structure/function, including CACNA1F, GRM6, TRMP1 and G\u03b10, and a normal scotopic a-wave electroretinogram amplitude, markedly reduced scotopic electroretinogram b-wave and modestly reduced photopic cone response. This confirmed the impaired function of the photoreceptor ribbon synapses and retinal bipolar cells, as is also observed in congenital stationary night blindness. Since congenital stationary night blindness present at birth, we extended our analysis to retinal differentiation and showed impaired differentiation of different bipolar cell subtypes and an altered temporal sequence of development from OFF to ON laminae in the inner plexiform layer. This was associated with the altered expression patterns of bipolar cell generation and differentiation factors, including MATH3, CHX10, VSX1 and OTX2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that APLP2 couples retina development and synaptic genes and present the first evidence that APLP2 expression may be linked to synaptic disease."

Our data supported the hypothesis that a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation-as seen in the IT gain-of-function mutant (2)-may reduce the dynamic range of photoreceptor activity. Morphologically, the retinal outer nuclear layer in adult IT mutants was reduced in size and cone outer segments appeared shorter. The organization of the outer plexiform layer was disrupted, and synaptic structures of photoreceptors had a variable, partly immature, appearance. The associated visual deficiency was substantiated in behavioral paradigms. The IT mouse line serves as a specific model for the functional phenotype of human CSNB2 patients with gain-of-function mutations and may help to further understand the dysfunction in CSNB. "

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Marked attenuation of the single-flash electroretinographic (ERG) b-wave in the presence of a normal-amplitude or less-attenuated a-wave is commonly referred to as the \"negative ERG.\" The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the disparate origins of the negative ERG in three murine models can be discriminated using flickering stimuli. METHODS: Three models were selected: (1) the Nyx (nob) mouse model of complete congenital stationary night blindness, (2) the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) rat model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and (3) the Rs1 knockout (KO) mouse model of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis. Directly after a dark-adapted, single-flash ERG luminance series, a flicker ERG frequency series (0.5-30 Hz) was performed at a fixed luminance of 0.5 log cd s/m(2). This series includes frequency ranges that are dominated by activity in (A) the rod pathways (below 5 Hz), (B) the cone ON-pathway (5-15 Hz), and (C) the cone OFF-pathway (above 15 Hz). RESULTS: All three models produced markedly attenuated single-flash ERG b-waves. In the Nyx (nob) mouse, which features postsynaptic deficits in the ON-pathways, the a-wave was normal and flicker responses were attenuated in ranges A and B, but not C. The ROP rat is characterized by inner-retinal ischemia which putatively affects both ON- and OFF-bipolar cell activity; flicker responses were reduced in all ranges (A-C). Notably, the choroid supplies the photoreceptors and is thought to be relatively intact in OIR, an idea supported by the nearly normal a-wave. Finally, in the Rs1 KO mouse, which has documented abnormality of the photoreceptor-bipolar synapse affecting both ON- and OFF-pathways, the flicker responses were attenuated in all ranges (A-C). The a-wave was also attenuated, likely as a consequence to schisms in the photoreceptor layer. CONCLUSION: Consideration of both single-flash and flickering ERG responses can discriminate the functional pathology of the negative ERG in these animal models of human disease."

                "abstract": "Mutations in TRPM1 are found in humans with an autosomal recessive form of complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). The Trpm1(-/-) mouse has been an important animal model for this condition. Here we report a new mouse mutant, tvrm27, identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen. Genetic mapping of the no b-wave electroretinogram (ERG) phenotype of tvrm27 localized the mutation to a chromosomal region that included Trpm1. Complementation testing with Trpm1(-/-) mice confirmed a mutation in Trpm1. Sequencing identified a nucleotide change in exon 23, converting a highly conserved alanine within the pore domain to threonine (p.A1068T). Consistent with prior studies of Trpm1(-/-) mice, no anatomical changes were noted in the Trpm1(tvrm27/tvrm27) retina. The Trpm1(tvrm27/tvrm27) phenotype is distinguished from that of Trpm1(-/-) by the retention of TRPM1 expression on the dendritic tips of depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). While ERG b-wave amplitudes of Trpm1(+/-) heterozygotes are comparable to wild type, those of Trpm1(+/tvrm27) mice are reduced by 32%. A similar reduction in the response of Trpm1(+/tvrm27) DBCs to LY341495 or capsaicin is evident in whole cell recordings. These data indicate that the p.A1068T mutant TRPM1 acts as a dominant negative with respect to TRPM1 channel function. Furthermore, these data indicate that the number of functional TRPM1 channels at the DBC dendritic tips is a key factor in defining DBC response amplitude. The Trpm1(tvrm27/tvrm27) mutant will be useful for elucidating the role of TRPM1 in DBC signal transduction, for determining how Trpm1 mutations impact central visual processing, and for evaluating experimental therapies for cCSNB."

            "abstract": "Chronic wounds in diabetes undergo a lifetime risk of developing into diabetic foot ulcers. Oxygen is crucial to wound healing by regulating cell proliferation, migration, and neovascularization. However, current oxygen therapies, including hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and topical gaseous oxygen (TGO), mainly employ gaseous oxygen delivery, which is much less effective in penetrating the skin. Here, we introduce an oxygen-producing patch, made of living microalgae hydrogel, which can produce dissolved oxygen. The superior performance of the patch that results from its dissolved oxygen delivery is >100-fold much more efficient than TGO penetrating the skin. Further experiments indicate that the patch could promote cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro, and improve chronic wound healing and the survival of skin grafts in diabetic mice. We believe that the microalgae-gel patch can provide continuous dissolved oxygen to improve chronic wound healing."

While both nitric oxide and oxygen have been shown to promote wound healing in DFUs through anti-inflammatory and neovascularization, there is currently no available therapy that delivers both. We present a novel hydrogel consisting of Weissella and Chlorella, which alternates between nitric oxide and oxygen production to reduce chronic inflammation and hypoxia. Further experiments indicate that the hydrogel accelerates wound closure, re-epithelialization, and angiogenesis in diabetic mice and improves the survival of skin grafts. This dual-gas therapy holds promise as a potential treatment option for the management of diabetic wounds."

                "abstract": "Chronic diabetic wounds are at lifelong risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers owing to severe hypoxia, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a complex inflammatory microenvironment, and the potential for bacterial infection. Here we develop a programmed treatment strategy employing live Haematococcus (HEA). By modulating light intensity, HEA can be programmed to perform a variety of functions, such as antibacterial activity, oxygen supply, ROS scavenging, and immune regulation, suggesting its potential for use in programmed therapy. Under high light intensity (658\u2009nm, 0.5\u2009W/cm2), green HEA (GHEA) with efficient photothermal conversion mediate wound surface disinfection. By decreasing the light intensity (658\u2009nm, 0.1\u2009W/cm2), the photosynthetic system of GHEA can continuously produce oxygen, effectively resolving the problems of hypoxia and promoting vascular regeneration. Continuous light irradiation induces astaxanthin (AST) accumulation in HEA cells, resulting in a gradual transformation from a green to red hue (RHEA). RHEA effectively scavenges excess ROS, enhances the expression of intracellular antioxidant enzymes, and directs polarization to M2 macrophages by secreting AST vesicles via exosomes. The living HEA hydrogel can sterilize and enhance cell proliferation and migration and promote neoangiogenesis, which could improve infected diabetic wound healing in female mice."

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy works by elevating the plasma oxygen level. Fibroblasts synthesise and modify collagen, and both these activities require relatively high partial pressures of oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen can promote healing by stimulating fibroblast activity and collagen formation. Increasing oxygen tensions also has a direct and toxic effect on anaerobes, therefore hyperbaric oxygen therapy has a special role in treating diabetic foot infections. Studies on hyperbaric oxygen therapy in general show it to be a beneficial adjunctive therapy for diabetic foot ulcers. However much of the work is anecdotal and more controlled trials are required."

Hydrogen has the potential to act as an antioxidant and scavenge reactive oxygen species, thereby attenuating inflammation in these chronic wounds. However, most of the reported H2 delivery systems for wound healing, including hydrogen gas, hydrogen-rich water, and hydrogen-rich saline, are very short-lived for the low solubility of hydrogen gas. Here, we introduce a hydrogen-producing hydrogel made of living Chlorella and bacteria within a cell-impermeable casing that can continuously produce hydrogen for 60 h. This microbe-hydrogel system can selectively reduce highly toxic \u2022OH and ONOO- species and reduce inflammation. Additional experiments indicated that the microbe-hydrogel dressing could promote cell proliferation and diabetic wound healing by almost 50% at day 3. The symbiotic algae-bacteria hydrogel has excellent biocompatibility and reactive oxygen species scavenging features, indicating it has great promise for clinical use."

                "abstract": "Hypoxia, chronic inflammation, and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by hyperglycemia pose formidable challenges to the healing of diabetic chronic wounds, often resulting in impaired recovery. Currently, sustainable and eco-friendly therapeutic approaches targeting this multifaceted problem remain uncharted. Herein, we develop a unique three-functional covalent organic framework (COF)-modified microalgae gel designed for the preparation and treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. The gel comprises an oxygen-releasing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) microalgae matrix, augmented by an ROS-responsive COF. Although two of these components have been reported to be used in wound healing, the combination of all three functions represents an innovative approach to synergize the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. Therefore, we propose a new concept of \"ligand interlocking\" with three functional synergistic effects. Specifically, the COF has a similar effect to the \"double Excalibur\", which binds bFGF to promote angiogenesis and proliferation and inhibit the inflammatory response of chronic wounds and binds live microalgae to eliminate ROS and release dissolved oxygen to alleviate the hypoxia of wounds. Moreover, in vivo experiments and RNA sequencing analyses similarly demonstrated that the COF-modified microalgae gel reduced the inflammatory cascade cycle in the wound site and promoted vascular and tissue regeneration. We posit that the COF-modified microalgae gel represents a promising strategy for the active in vivo delivery of therapeutics to the wound body in intensive care unit settings."

                "abstract": "As the incidence of diabetes increases, its complication, diabetic foot ulcers, has become the main type of clinically chronic refractory wounds. Due to the hyperglycemic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, which leads to vascular defects and bacterial growth, the therapeutic effect of wound dressings lacking strategic design is relatively limited. In this study, we designed an injectable, \"self-healing\", and glucose-responsive multifunctional metal-organic drug-loaded hydrogel (DG@Gel) for diabetic wound healing. The functionalized hydrogel was prepared by phase-transfer-mediated metallo-nanodrugs, which were made by co-assembling zinc ions, organic ligands, and a small-molecule drug, deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), and the programmed loading of glucose oxidase (GOX). When injected into a diabetic wound, the GOX in DG@Gel changed the hyperglycemic wound microenvironment by decomposing excess glucose into hydrogen peroxide and glucuronic acid, which decreased the pH of the wound site. The low pH promoted the release of zinc ions and DFO, which exhibited synergistic antibacterial and angiogenesis activity for diabetic wound repair. In vitro experiments revealed the antibacterial activity and the cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation ability of DG@Gel. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that DG@Gel can induce re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis during wound healing in diabetic mice with good biocompatibility and biodegradability. The results suggest that this hydrogel is a promising innovative dressing for the treatment of diabetic wounds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Diabetic ulcers, as one of the main types of chronic refractory wounds, are not treated effectively in the clinic due to a lack of strategic approach. In this study, we designed a glucose-responsive multifunctional metal-organic drug-loaded hydrogel (DG@Gel), which can change the hyperglycemic wound microenvironment by decomposing excess glucose into hydrogen peroxide and glucuronic acid. This in turn promoted the release of zinc ions and deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) in the hydrogel, which exhibited synergistic antibacterial and angiogenic activity for diabetic wound repair. Furthermore, the DG@Gel exhibited good biocompatibility and biodegradability in vivo. In general, this innovative strategy design may have great application potential in the treatment of various chronic wounds."

                "abstract": "Management of chronic diabetic ulcers remains as a major challenge in healthcare which requires extensive multidisciplinary approaches to ensure wound protection, management of excess wound exudates and promoting healing. Developing wound healing patches that can act as a protective barrier and support healing is highly needed to manage chronic diabetic ulcers. In order to boost the wound healing potential of patch material, bioactive agents such as growth factors can be used. Porous membranes made of nanofibers generated using electrospinning have potential for application as wound coverage matrices. However, electrospun membranes produced from several biodegradable polymers are hydrophobic and cannot manage the excess exudates produced by chronic wounds. Gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels absorb excess exudates and provide an optimal biological environment for the healing wound. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes cell migration, angiogenesis and overall wound healing. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) membranes provide microbial, thermal and mechanical barrier properties to the wound healing patch. Herein, we developed a biodegradable polymeric patch based on the combination of mechanically stable electrospun PHBV, GelMA hydrogel and EGF for promoting diabetic wound healing. In vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate the effect of developed patches on cell proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis and wound healing. Our results showed that EGF loaded patches can promote the migration and proliferation of multiple types of cells (keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and enhance angiogenesis. In situ development of the patch and subsequent in vivo wound healing study in diabetic rats showed that EGF loaded patches provide rapid healing compared to control wounds. Interestingly, 100\u00a0ng EGF per cm2 of the patches was enough to provide favourable cellular response, angiogenesis and rapid diabetic wound healing. Overall results indicate that EGF loaded PHBV-GelMA hybrid patch could be a promising approach to promote diabetic wound healing."

Although promising, strategies that involve cell-based therapies and the local release of exogenous growth factors are costly, require very long development times, and result in modest improvements in patient outcome. We describe the development of an antioxidant shape-conforming regenerative wound dressing that uses the laminin-derived dodecapeptide A5G81 as a potent tethered cell adhesion-, proliferation-, and haptokinesis-inducing ligand to locally promote wound closure. A5G81 immobilized within a thermoresponsive citrate-based hydrogel facilitates integrin-mediated spreading, migration, and proliferation of dermal and epidermal cells, resulting in faster tissue regeneration in diabetic wounds. This peptide-hydrogel system represents a paradigm shift in dermoconductive and dermoinductive strategies for treating DFU without the need for soluble biological or pharmacological factors."

Therefore, oxygen-delivering systems have drawn much attention and evolved continuously. Here, we propose that an active Chlorella vulgaris (Cv)-loaded separable microneedle (MN) can be used to control oxygen delivery, which then promotes wound healing. The Cv-loaded microneedles (CvMN) consist of a polyvinyl acetate (PVA) substrate and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) tips with encapsulated Cv. Once CvMN is applied to diabetic wound, the PVA basal layer is rapidly dissolved in a short time, while the noncytotoxic and biocompatible GelMA tips remain in the skin. By taking advantage of the photosynthesis of Cv, oxygen would be continuously produced in a green way and released from CvMN in a controlled manner. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that CvMN could promote cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis and enhance wound healing in diabetic mice effectively. The remarkable therapeutic effect is mainly attributed to the continuous generation of dissolved oxygen in CvMN and the presence of antioxidant vitamins, \u03b3-linolenic acid, and linoleic acid in Cv. Thus, CvMN provides a promising strategy for diabetic wound healing with more possibility of clinical transformations."

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been proven to be an effective clinical method for the treatment of DFU. However, the mechanisms still to be elucidated. METHODS: Diabetic foot mice model was established, and treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Haematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining and Masson's trichrome staining were used for the analysis of wound healing. Human skin fibroblast (HSF) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECS) were exposed to high glucose and hyperbaric oxygen for studying the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen promoted wound healing in vitro. Wound healing assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, cell proliferation assay and tube formation assay were used for the analysis of wound healing. Quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for the analysis of gene expression. RESULTS: HBOT facilitated wound healing in DFU mice model, and promoted the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, VEGFA, SDF-1, VEGFR2 and CXCR4. Hyperbaric oxygen promoted the proliferation, migration and ROS production, as well as the expression of SDF-1 and VEGFA in HSF. HBOT stimulated the proliferation, migration and tube formation, as well as the expression of CXCR4 and VEGFR2 in HUVECS. CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen potentiates angiogenesis and diabetic wound healing by activating HIF-1\u03b1 signaling, so as to promote the expression of VEGF/SDF-1 in HSF and the expression of VEGFR/CXCR4 in HUVECS, ultimately to promote the proliferation of HSF and the angiogenesis of HUVECS."

The released oxygen effectively promotes cell migration and angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions as validated in vitro. The in vivo tests in diabetic mice models show that the sustainably released oxygen significantly facilitates the synthesis of ECM, induces angiogenesis, and decreases the expression of inflammatory cytokines, achieving a diabetic wound healing rate of 84.2% on day 7, outperforming the existing oxygen-releasing approaches. Moreover, the proposed hydrogel patch is designed with porous, soft, antibacterial, biodegradable, and storage stability for 15 days. The proposed hydrogel patch is expected to be promising in clinics treating diabetic wounds."

High pressure pure oxygen assists in the oxygenation of hypoxic wounds to increase perfusion. Although oxygen therapy provides wound healing benefits to some patients with diabetic foot ulcers, it is currently performed from clinical examination and imaging. Data suggest that oxygen therapy promotes wound healing via angiogenesis, the creation of new blood vessels. Molecular biomarkers relating to tissue inflammation, repair, and healing have been identified. Predictive biomarkers can be used to identify patients who will most likely benefit from this specialized treatment. In diabetic foot ulcerations, specifically, certain biomarkers have been linked to factors involving angiogenesis and inflammation, two crucial aspects of wound healing. In this review, the mechanism of how oxygen works in wound healing on a physiological basis, such as cell metabolism and growth factor signaling transduction is detailed. Additionally, observable clinical outcomes such as collagen formation, angiogenesis, respiratory burst and cell proliferation are described. The scientific evidence for the impact of oxygen on biomolecular pathways and its relationship to the outcomes in clinical research is discussed in this narrative review."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The annual incidence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) has been reported to vary from 0.2% to 11% in diabetes-specific clinical settings and less than 0.1% to 8% in community- and population-based cohorts. According to the International Diabetes Foundation, approximately 40 million to 60 million people worldwide are affected by DFUs, and a recent meta-analysis indicates a global prevalence of 6.3% among adults with diabetes, or about 33 million individuals. The cost of diabetes care is significant, amounting to $273 billion in direct and $90 billion in indirect expenses annually, in America. Foot complications in diabetes care excess annual expenditures ranging from 50% to 200% above the baseline cost of diabetes-related care. The cost of advanced-stage ulcers can be more than $50,000 per wound episode, and the direct expenses of major amputation are even higher. DFUs can be treated using various methods, including wound dressings, antibiotics, pressure-off loading, skin substitutes, stem cells, debridement, topical oxygen therapy, gene therapy and growth factors. For severe DFUs patients are at risk of amputation if treatment is not timely or appropriate. Amputating limbs not only causes physical pain to patients, but also brings economic burden due to lost productivity, and decreased employment linked to DFUs. Currently, long-term use of local antibiotics in clinical practice is prone to induce drug resistance, while growth factors do not effectively inhibit bacterial growth and control inflammation in wounds. Stem cell and gene therapies are still in the experimental stage. The method of local debridement combined with negative pressure therapy is expensive. Therefore, we urgently need an affordable, non-surgical method to treat diabetic ulcers. Extracts of bark of Bauhinia purpurea, Paeoniae rubrae, Angelica dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav. (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav., Acorus calamus L, and Radix Angelicae biseratae have been used as traditional remedies to treat inflammation-related diseases and cutaneous wounds due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to promote vascular renewal. However, there have been few studies on the mixture of these five herbal extracts on diabetic wound healing. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the healing effect of a mixture of five aforementioned herbal extracts on diabetic ulcer wounds in rats, and to reveal the potential mechanisms behind any potential wound healing using transcriptomics and proteomics. STUDY DESIGN: We designed the experiment to explore the effects of five herbal extracts on diabetic wound healing process through in vivo experiments and to investigate the underlying mechanisms through proteomics and transcriptomics. METHODS: We used a mixture of five aforementioned herbal extract to treat rat model of diabetic established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 cm round full-thickness skin defect was created on the back of the rat. Staphylococcus aureus (1 ml of 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 cfu/ml) was evenly applied to the wound. The wound was then observed for 72 h. The infected ulcer model of diabetic rats was considered to be successfully established if the wound was found to be infected with S. aureus. According to different medications, the rats were divided into three groups, namely mixture of herbal extract (MHE), Kangfuxin solution (KFS) and control (Ctrl). The effects of the medicine on wound healing were observed. HE staining and Masson staining were performed to evaluate the histopathological changes and collagen synthesis. IHC staining was used to assess the neovascularization, and M2 macrophage proliferation was determined by immunofluorescence staining. Proteomic and transcriptomic studies were performed to explore potential mechanism of five herbal extracts to promote wound healing. UHPLC-QE-MS was performed to identify the chemical composition of mixture of herbal extract. RESULTS: The study show that the mixed herbal extract promotes angiogenesis, proliferation of M2 macrophages, and collagen synthesis. Transcriptomics showed that rno-miR-1298, rno-miR-144-5p, and rno-miR-92a-1-5p are vital miRNAs which also play a significant role in role in regulating wound healing. Proteomics results showed that the following proteins were important in wounds treated with MHE: Rack1, LOC100362366, Cops2, Cops6, Eif4e, Eif3c, Rpl12, Srp54, Rpl13 and Lsm7. Autophagy, PI3-Akt and mTOR signaling pathways were enriched after treatment with MHE compared to other groups. CONCLUSION: Herein, we have shown that MHE containing extracts of bark of Bauhinia purpurea, P. rubrae, A. dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex Franch. & Sav., A. calamus L, and R. A. biseratae has significant wound healing effects in the diabetic ulcer wound rat model. These results suggest that local application of MHE in diabetic wounds can accelerate the wound healing process. Moreover, in vivo experiments revealed that the diabetic wound healing process was primarily mediated by angiogenesis and M2 macrophage transition. Therefore, this study may provide a promising and non-surgical therapeutic strategy to accelerate diabetic wound healing, thereby decreasing the number of limb amputations in diabetic patients."

                "abstract": "Common causes for non-healing of diabetic foot ulcers are infection and/or ischaemia. Diabetic patients are compromised hosts as far as wound healing is concerned. Diabetes mellitus is associated with a defective cellular and humoral immunity. In particular, decreased chemotaxis, decreased phagocytosis, impaired bacterial killing and abnormal lymphocytic function have been observed, resulting in a reduced inflammatory reaction and defective wound healing. The potential benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in diabetic patients with a foot ulcer are discussed. Oxygen plays an important role in the physiology of wound healing. HBO can raise tissue oxygen tensions to levels where wound healing can be expected. Hyperbaric oxygen increases also the killing ability of leucocytes, is lethal for certain anaerobic bacteria and inhibits toxin formation in other anaerobes. Multiple anecdotal reports and retrospective studies in HBO therapy in diabetic patients suggest that HBO can be an effective adjunct in the management of diabetic wounds. Prospective studies also show the beneficial effects of HBO. Because most published studies suffer from methodological problems, there is an urgent need for a collaborative, international, randomised prospective clinical trial for the application of HBO in diabetic foot lesions, as part of a multidisciplinary treatment approach, before we can recommend HBO as standard therapy in patients with foot ulcers."

Since atmospheric oxygen air can only penetrate about 0.3\u00a0mm tissues, meanwhile oxygen from the circulation is difficult to reach chronic wounds through the destroyed blood vessels, a solution to deliver oxygen locally and permeably is urgently needed. Herein we report a technique to reform traditional gel-based wound dressings by adding lyophilized oxygen encapsulated nanoparticles, which can deliver dissolved oxygen locally into wound surface. This delivery technique can potentially evaluate the therapeutic effects on hypoxic epithelial, endothelial and fibroblasts in vitro. Further experiments confirm the effects on both open wounds bearing and flap transplanted diabetic mice models. Considering its biocompatibility, effectiveness and practicality, we believe our hydrogel has significant transformation value to care and accelerate the healing of various clinical wounds, especially chronic wound."

                "abstract": "Diabetic cutaneous ulcers (DCU) are a complication for diabetes patients, mostly occurring in the foot and causing non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is currently being investigated as a therapeutic avenue for chronic diabetic ulcers. However, poor engraftment, short retention, and low survival still limit the treatment effectiveness. Hydroactive\u00ae Gel is a sterile transparent gel made of natural hydrocolloid, which has been widely used for wound management. Whether transplantation of Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs) encapsulated with Hydroactive\u00ae Gel is helpful to diabetic ulcers wound healing remains to be explored. The biocompatibility experiments showed that WJMSCs embedded in Hydroactive\u00ae Gel did not influence the cell viability, survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of WJMSCs in vitro. RNA-seq results also implied that Hydroactive\u00ae Gel + WJMSCs transplantation activated the \"cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\", \"mononuclear cell differentiation\", \"regulation of cell-cell adhesion\", and \"chemokine receptor activity\" to accelerate the inflammatory reaction and epidermis regeneration in diabetic wounds. Histological analysis results demonstrated that Hydroactive\u00ae Gel encapsulated WJMSCs transplantation promoted diabetic wound healing and regeneration, indicating improved dermis regeneration, sebaceous gland formation, and type III collagen fiber deposition. Besides, immunohistochemical analysis results showed that Hydroactive\u00ae Gel + WJMSCs transplantation also facilitated the transformation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, cell proliferation, and neovascularization at the wound site. Hydroactive\u00ae Gel encapsulation further prolonged the retention time of WJMSCs at the diabetic wound site. Above all, Hydroactive\u00ae Gel accelerates WJMSCs-mediated diabetic wound healing by promoting macrophage transformation, facilitating cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and prolonging cell retention time. Our findings may potentially provide a useful therapeutic strategy based on the combination of WJMSCs and biomedical materials for patients with diabetic cutaneous ulcers."

                "abstract": "Non-healing wounds are one of the chronic complications of diabetes and have remained a worldwide challenge as one of the major health problems. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is proven to be very successful for diabetic wound treatment, for which the molecular basis is not understood. Adipocytes regulate multiple aspects of repair and may be therapeutic for inflammatory diseases and defective wound healing associated with aging and diabetes. Endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles could promote wound healing in diabetes. To study the mechanism by which HBO promotes wound healing in diabetes, we investigated the effect of HBO on fat cells in diabetic mice. A diabetic wound mouse model was established and treated with HBO. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescence were used for the analysis of wound healing. To further explore the mechanism, we performed whole-genome sequencing on extracellular vesicles (EVs). Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experiments. Specifically, exosomes were collected from human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cells after HBO treatment, and then these exosomes were co-incubated with adipose tissue. The wound healing rate in diabetic mice treated with HBO was significantly higher. HBO therapy promotes the proliferation of adipose precursor cells. HUVEC-derived exosomes treated with HBO significantly promoted fat cell browning. These data clarify that HBO therapy may promote vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and promote browning of fat cells through vascular endothelial cells derived exosomes, thereby promoting diabetic wound healing. This provides new ideas for the application of HBO therapy in the treatment of diabetic trauma."

Local high oxygen concentration is required by the metabolically active cells in the wound, which may render the region hypoxic, even in the absence of peripheral arterial disease. Therefore, the contribution of hyperbaric oxygen to improved healing rates has been extensively investigated. More recent developments include products delivering topical oxygen therapy (TOT) directly at the wound site, either by continuous delivery or by pressurized systems. A very recent systematic review has found that TOT increases wound healing rates in chronic, less severe diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), and it promotes high rates of healing in more severe ulcers. Thus, TOT appears to be very promising to improve healing in DFUs. We now need more experience regarding its therapeutic place in the algorithm of DFU management and in relation to optimal patient selection."

                "abstract": "Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been used as an adjunctive therapy for diabetic foot ulcers, although its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Recently, it has been shown that HBO mobilizes the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from bone marrow that eventually will aggregate in the wound. However, the gathering of the EPCs in diabetic wounds is impaired because of the decreased levels of local stromal-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1). Therefore, we investigated the influence of HBO on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a central regulator of SDF-1\u03b1 and is down-regulated in diabetic wounds. The effects of HBO on HIF-1\u03b1 function were studied in human dermal fibroblasts, SKRC7 cells, and HIF-1\u03b1 knock-out and wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts using appropriate techniques (Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and luciferase hypoxia-responsive element reporter assay). Cellular proliferation was assessed using H(3) -thymidine incorporation assay. The effect of HIF in combination with HBOT was tested by inoculating stable HIF-1\u03b1-expressing adenovirus (Adv-HIF) into experimental wounds in db/db mice exposed to HBO. HBO activates HIF-1\u03b1 at several levels by increasing both HIF-1\u03b1 stability (by a non-canonical mechanism) and activity (as shown both by induction of relevant target genes and by a specific reporter assay). HIF-1\u03b1 induction has important biological relevance because the induction of fibroblast proliferation in HBO disappears when HIF-1\u03b1 is knocked down. Moreover, the local transfer of stable HIF-1\u03b1-expressing adenovirus (Adv-HIF) into experimental wounds in diabetic (db/db mice) animals has an additive effect on HBO-mediated improvements in wound healing. In conclusion, HBO stabilizes and activates HIF-1, which contributes to increased cellular proliferation. In diabetic animals, the local transfer of active HIF further improves the effects of HBO on wound healing. "

                "title": "Wound healing. New modalities for a new millennium.",
                "abstract": "Common to all studies of wound healing modalities is the need to convert the chronic wound into an acute wound and to maintain the wound in an acute state while subsequently using adjunctive therapy. Hence, precise control and documentation of wound care is extremely important in order to avoid contamination of the effects of a specific modality with the effects of good wound care. Falanga has noted that neuropathy of diabetes has been given wide support as the primary pathogenic component of diabetic ulcers, whereas less recognition has been made of the wound-healing failure component. The therapies discussed in this article considered the wound-healing failure component. Oxygen is a drug. The use of oxygen under normobaric conditions at higher than normal inspired partial pressures is standard operating procedure when clinicians are faced with patients with respiratory embarrassment or heart failure. The use of oxygen under hyperbaric conditions, however, remains estranged from the mainstream thoughts of most clinicians. Abnormally hypoxic wounds may benefit from specific oxygen therapy in hyperbaric dosage ranges. However, correction of abnormal wound oxygen tension alone does not guarantee healing. Hyperbaric studies have been criticized for the lack of well-defined wound care protocols, the absence of precise wound healing measures, and poorly defined wound healing endpoints. Studies with growth factors and human skin equivalents exclude patients typically referred for hyperbaric therapy. Patients referred for hyperbaric therapy often have larger wounds with greater severity of peripheral vascular disease with ABIs < 0.7 and TcPO2 < 30 to 40 mm Hg, are often on medications known to inhibit wound healing (e.g., steroids), or have concomitant medical disorders (collagen vascular disease, renal failure) associated with poor healing. No hyperbaric study has controlled stringently for all of these factors. Nevertheless, HBO2 is more specific and successful for the intended purpose of correction of abnormal tissue oxygen tensions than are growth factors for the intended purpose of growth. Similarly, skin substitutes are limited in their application and have not been tried in patients with ABIs < 0.7 or TcPO2 values < 30 mm Hg. In our view, hyperbaric therapy probably can be combined successfully with allogenic grafts and human skin equivalents in this group of patients. Hyperbaric therapy can generate a sufficient granulation base in which these products should be able to close properly selected wounds successfully. No studies of this combined modality approach exist. Finally, regardless of the modality used to aid in wound closure, long-term outcomes probably depend more on neuropathy and large vessel disease than on microangiopathy and local wound-healing defects. The modalities presented in this article must prove to be both cost effective and practical before they are widely disseminated. Nevertheless, the ability to manipulate the local wound environment is no longer inviolate as was once presumed, and current investigations continue to advance therapeutic options in this most fascinating and challenging discipline."

            "abstract": "High-throughput metabolite profiling provides the opportunity to reveal metabolic mechanisms and identify biomarkers. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease. However, the role of metabolism in psoriasis pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: Plasma samples of individuals (45 psoriasis and 45 sex-, age-, and BMI-matched healthy controls) were collected. Non-targeted metabolomics and amino acid- or carnitine-targeted metabolomics were conducted, then, plasma samples of mice induced by imiquimod (IMQ) were subjected to the amino acid- and carnitine-targeted metabolomic profiling. Flow cytometry was used to study the effect of L-carnitine (LC(C0)) on IMQ-induced psoriatic inflammation. Results: Through the non-targeted metabolomics approach, we detected significantly altered amino acids and carnitines in psoriasis patients. Amino acid-targeted metabolomic profiling identified 37 amino acids altered in psoriasis, of these 23 were markedly upregulated, including essential amino acids (EAAs), and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whereas glutamine, cysteine, and asparagine were significantly down-regulated. Carnitine-targeted metabolomic profiling identified 40 significantly altered carnitines, 14 of which included palmitoylcarnitine (C16) and were markedly downregulated in psoriasis, whereas hexanoylcarnitine (C6) and 3-OH-octadecenoylcarnitine (C18:1-OH) were significantly upregulated. Interestingly, glutamine, asparagine, and C16 levels were negatively correlated with the PASI score. Moreover, a higher abundance of LC(C0) was associated with markedly reduced IMQ-induced epidermal thickening and infiltration of Th17 cells in skin lesions, indicating LC(C0) supplementation as a potential therapy for psoriasis treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggested the metabolism of amino acids and carnitines are significantly altered in psoriasis, especially the metabolism of EAAs, BCAAs, and LC(C0), which may play key roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

However, the specific mechanisms underlying the development of psoriasis remain unclear. Untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics have been used separately to profile biomarkers and risk genes in the serum of psoriasis patients. However, the integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics to identify dysregulated metabolites and genes in the psoriatic skin is lacking. In this study, we performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mice and healthy controls, and found that levels of a total of 4,188 metabolites differed in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice compared with those in control mice. Metabolomic data analysis using MetaboAnalyst showed that the metabolic pathways of primary metabolites, such as folate biosynthesis and galactose metabolism, were significantly altered in the skin of mice after treatment with IMQ. Furthermore, IMQ treatment also significantly altered metabolic pathways of secondary metabolites, including histidine metabolism, in mouse skin tissues. The metabolomic results were verified by transcriptomics analysis. RNA-seq results showed that histamine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA levels were significantly upregulated after IMQ treatment. Targeted inhibition of histamine biosynthesis process using HDC-specific inhibitor, pinocembrin (PINO), significantly alleviated epidermal thickness, downregulated the expression of interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-23, and inhibited the infiltration of immune cells during IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation. In conclusion, our study offers a validated and comprehensive understanding of metabolism during the development of psoriasis and demonstrated that PINO could protect against IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation."

However, an extensive, unbiased metabolic analysis in patients with psoriasis has not been completely explored. The metabolome represents the end products of proteomics or cellular processes that may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To determine the differences in serum metabolomic profiles among patients with psoriasis and healthy controls with the goal of identifying potential biomarkers in patients with psoriasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum metabolomic profiles from 29 subjects (14 patients with psoriasis and 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls). The serum metabolites were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based on a combined full scan and selected-ion monitoring mode. RESULTS: Multivariate statistical analysis of metabolomics data revealed altered serum metabolites between the patients with psoriasis and healthy individuals. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with psoriasis had higher levels of amino acids including asparagine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, phenylalanine, ornithine and proline; higher levels of lactic acid and urea; and lower levels of crotonic acid, azelaic acid, ethanolamine and cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the glycolysis pathway and amino acid metabolic activity are increased in patients with psoriasis. These metabolic perturbations may stem from increased demand for protein biosynthesis and keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Our findings may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of psoriasis and provide insights into early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention."

Pathway analyses were employed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the metabolite profile. This study included 93 patients (73 PV and 20 PPP) and an equal number of HVs. PV patients showed increased levels of sarcosine, serotonin, propionylcarnitine, proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, taurine, spermine and ornithine, but exhibited a decreased level of acetylcarnitine than matched HVs. Notably, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PPP patients. Furthermore, the sarcosine/glycine ratio was significantly higher in both PV and PPP patients than in HVs. Pathway analysis showed significant increases in metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism and the urea cycle in PV patients. In conclusion, this study demonstrated distinct metabolic profiles in PV and PPP patients compared to HVs, suggesting sarcosine as a potential biomarker for psoriasis."

However, the intermediate metabolites involved in this change remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We conducted targeted metabolomics profiling to identify moieties associated with adult obesity. METHODS: In this case-control study of Iranian adults, 200 obese patients were compared with 100 controls based on 104 metabolites profiled by a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analysis comprised acylcarnitines, diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCaa), acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCae), sphingomyelins (SM), lyso-phospholipids (LPC) and amino acids. We performed multivariable linear regression to identify metabolites associated with obesity, adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, total physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS: A pattern of 19 metabolites was significantly associated with obesity. Branched chain amino acids, alanine, glutamic acid, proline, tyrosine LPCa C16:1, PCaa C32:1, PCaa C32:2 and PCaa C38:3 were positively, while serine, asparagine, LPCa C18:1, LPCa C18:2, LPCe C18:0, PCae C34:3, PCae C38:4 and PCae C40:6 were negatively associated with obesity (all p\u2009<\u20090.00048).

Metabolomic profiling allows simultaneous detection of biochemicals originating from cells, organs, or exogenous origin that may be valuable for monitoring of disease severity or in diagnosis. AIM: We hypothesized that metabolomics using serum from children would differentiate CF from non-CF lung disease subjects and would provide insight into metabolism in CF. METHODS: Serum collected from children with CF (n\u2009=\u200931) and 31 age and gender matched children with other lung diseases was used for metabolomic profiling by gas- and liquid-chromatography. Relative concentration of metabolites was compared between the groups using partial least square discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) and linear modeling. RESULTS: A clear separation of the two groups was seen in PLS-DA. Linear model found that among the 459 detected metabolites 92 differed between CF and non-CF. These included known biochemicals in lipid metabolism, oxidants, and markers consistent with abnormalities in bile acid processing. Bacterial metabolites were identified and differed between the groups indicating intestinal dysbiosis in CF. As a novel finding several pathways were markedly different in CF, which jointly point towards decreased activity in the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids. These pathways include low ketone bodies, low medium chain carnitines, elevated di-carboxylic acids and decreased 2-hydroxybutyrate from amino acid metabolism in CF compared to non-CF. CONCLUSION: Serum metabolomics discriminated CF from non-CF and show altered cellular energy metabolism in CF potentially reflecting mitochondrial dysfunction. Future studies are indicated to examine their relation to the underlying CF defect and their use as biomarkers for disease severity or for cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) function in an era of CFTR modifying drugs."

The cellular and molecular basis of GPP is poorly understood. Blood monocytes are key players of host defense and producers of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2. How the immune response of monocytes is affected by metabolic internal environment in GPP remains unclear. Here, we performed a metabolomic and functional investigation of GPP serum and monocytes. We demonstrated a significant increase in IL-1\u03b2 production from GPP monocytes. In GPP circulation, serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute-phase reactant, was dramatically increased, which induced the release of IL-1\u03b2 from monocytes in a NLRP3-dependent manner. Using metabolomic analysis, we showed that GPP serum exhibited an amino acid starvation signature, with glycine, histidine, asparagine, methionine, threonine, lysine, valine, isoleucine, tryptophan, tyrosine, alanine, proline, taurine and cystathionine being markedly downregulated. In functional assay, under amino acid starvation condition, SAA-stimulated mature IL-1\u03b2 secretion was suppressed. Mechanistically, at post-transcriptional level, amino acid starvation inhibited the SAA-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the immune-modulatory effect of amino acid starvation was blocked by silencing general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2), suggesting the involvement of amino acid response (AAR) pathway. Collectively, our results suggested that decreased serum amino acids in GPP blunted the innate immune response in blood monocytes through AAR pathway, serving as a feedback mechanism preventing excessive inflammation in GPP."

The expression of genes of the IL-17 signaling pathway (IL-17A, IL-17F, S100A9, CCL20, CXCL1) is significantly upregulated, leading to an accumulation of T cells and neutrophils in the skin. Moreover, the study finds that there is an inhibition of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism pathway, and the key gene branched-chain amino transferase 2 (Bcat2) is significantly downregulated, and the levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine are elevated in the HFD-IMQ mice. Furthermore, the study finds that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR \u03b3) is inhibited, while STAT3 activity is promoted in HFD-IMQ mice. CONCLUSION: HFD-induced obesity significantly amplifies IL-17 signaling and exacerbates psoriasis, with a potential role played by Bcat2-mediated BCAAs metabolism. The study suggests that BCAA catabolism and PPAR \u03b3-STAT3 exacerbate inflammation in psoriasis with obesity."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common chronic inflammatory arthritis, causing lasting back pain with progressive loss of spinal mobility. However, the exact pathogenesis of AS remains unclear. We aim to use the metabolomics analysis to characterize the metabolic profile of AS, in order to better understand the pathogenesis of AS and monitor disease activity and progression. METHODS: The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ-MS) was used for investigating the serum amino acid metabolomic profiling of 30 AS patients, in comparison with 32 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 30 healthy controls, combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Metabolite association analysis with disease activity was performed using generalized linear regression. The metabolic pathway analysis for the important metabolites was performed using MetPA and the metabolic network was constructed. RESULTS: A total of 29 amino acids and biogenic amines were detected in all participants by UPLC-TQ-MS. It showed significant amino acid differences between the AS/RA patients and control subjects. Additionally, 4-hydroxy-L-proline, alanine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, glutamine, and taurine were identified as candidate markers shared by AS/RA groups. Specifically, lysine, proline, serine, and alanine were found correlated with disease activity of AS. Furthermore, the most significant metabolic pathway identified were alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate that UPLC-TQ-MS analysis method is a powerful tool to identify metabolite profiles of AS. Research in identified disease activity-associated metabolites and biological pathways may provide assistance for clinical diagnosis and pathological mechanism of AS. Key Points \u2022 There are perturbations of serum amino acid metabolism in AS, compared with RA and healthy controls, determined by UPLC-TQ-MS. \u2022 Metabolomics pathway is used to analysis for the differential metabolites of AS. \u2022 The altered serum amino acid could monitor disease activity of AS."

                "abstract": "Identifying the metabolome of human seminal plasma (HSP) is a new research area to screen putative biomarkers of infertility. This case-control study was performed on HSP specimens of 15 infertile patients with teratozoospermia (defined as normal sperm morphology\u2009<\u20094%) and 12 confirmed fertile normozoospermic men as the control group to investigate the seminal metabolic signature and whether there are differences in the metabolome between two groups. HSPs were subjected to LC-MS-MS analysis. MetaboAnalyst5.0 software was utilized for statistical analysis. Different univariate and multivariate analyses were used, including T-tests, fold change analysis, random forest (RF), and metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA). Teratozoospermic samples contained seventeen significantly different amino acids. Upregulated metabolites include glutamine, asparagine, and glycylproline, whereas downregulated metabolites include cysteine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, histidine, hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, glycine, proline, methionine, ornithine, tryptophan, aspartic acid, argininosuccinic acid, \u03b1-aminoadipic acid, and \u03b2-aminoisobutyric acid. RF algorithm defined a set of 15 metabolites that constitute the significant features of teratozoospermia. In particular, increased glutamine, asparagine, and decreased cysteine, tryptophan, glycine, and valine were strong predictors of teratozoospemia. The most affected metabolic pathways in teratozoospermic men are the aminoacyl-tRNA, arginine, valine-leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. Altered metabolites detected in teratozoospermia were responsible for various roles in sperm functions that classified into four subgroups as follows: related metabolites to antioxidant function, energy production, sperm function, and spermatogenesis. The altered amino acid metabolome identified in this study may be related to the etiology of teratozoospermia, and may provide novel insight into potential biomarkers of male infertility for therapeutic targets."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin condition marked by immune cell infiltration and keratinocyte abnormal proliferation. Cimicifugae Rhizoma - Smilax glabra Roxb (CS) herb pair, the main component of Shengma Detoxification Decoction, has been proven effective for the treatment of psoriasis. However, the mechanism is yet to be deciphered. PURPOSE: To explore the mechanism of CS for the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: The imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like lesion mouse model was used to identify the targets and the molecular mechanisms of CS. Network pharmacology combined with RNA-seq strategy was employed to predict the targets and mechanisms of CS for psoriasis. Metabolomics approaches were used to demonstrate the complexity of CS for the treatment of psoriasis. Finally, a compound-response-enzyme-gene network was constructed based on the multi-omics results to elucidate potential connections. RESULTS: The CS herb pair could significantly improve psoriatic lesions and reduce the inflammatory cell infiltration and proliferation of keratinocytes in skin lesions. Network pharmacology predicted that TNF, JNK, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 could be potential targets. RNA-seq data revealed that CS could significantly regulate genes and signaling pathways associated with Th17 responses, such as IL-36, IL-1\u03b2, CCl2, CXCL16, keratin 14, keratin 5, and antimicrobial peptides S100A8 and S100A9 well as MAPK, mTOR, and other signaling pathways. Further experimental data validated that CS treatment remarkably reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and factors, such as CCL2, CCL7, IL1F6, IL-17, IL-23, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2. This indicated that CS exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, metabolomic analyses demonstrated that CS treatment improved seven metabolic pathways, these included phenylalanine, tyrosine, pyruvate metabolism, carnitine metabolism, etc. Four key metabolites (L-Arginine, L-Phenylalanine, L-Carnitine, O-Acetylcarnitine) and nine differential genes (CMA1, PCBD2, TPSAB1, TPSB2, etc.) were identified that affected amino acid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and other pathways contributing to the infiltration of Th17 cells in psoriatic lesions. CONCLUSION: CS could alleviate IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis by reducing the expression of cytokines and chemokines mediated by the MAPK pathway, and improved amino acid and carnitine metabolism in vivo. Our study is the first to demonstrate the complex mechanism of CS for the treatment of psoriasis and provides a new paradigm to elucidate the pharmacological effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) drugs for psoriasis from multiple perspectives."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disease for which the crosstalk between genetic and environmental factors is responsible. To date, no definitive diagnostic criteria for psoriasis yet, and specific biomarkers are required. OBJECTIVE: We performed metabolome analysis to identify metabolite biomarkers of psoriasis and its subtypes such as psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). METHODS: We constructed metabolomics profiling of 130 plasma samples (42 PsA patients, 50 PsC patients, and 38 healthy controls) using a nontargeted metabolomics approach. RESULTS: Psoriasis-control association tests showed that one metabolite (ethanolamine phosphate) was significantly increased in psoriasis samples than in the controls, whereas three metabolites decreased (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; XA0019, nicotinic acid, and 20\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone). In the association test between PsA and PsC, tyramine significantly increased in PsA than in PsC, whereas mucic acid decreased (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Molecular pathway analysis of the PsA-PsC association test identified enrichment of vitamin digestion and absorption pathway in PsC (P = 1.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Correlation network analyses elucidated that a subnetwork centered on aspartate was constructed among the psoriasis-associated metabolites; meanwhile, the major subnetwork among metabolites with differences between PsA and PsC was primarily formed from saturated fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Our large-scale metabolome analysis highlights novel characteristics of plasma metabolites in psoriasis and the differences between PsA and PsC, which could be used as potential biomarkers of psoriasis and its clinical subtypes. These findings contribute to our understanding of psoriasis pathophysiology."

                "abstract": "A particular subgroup of obese adults, considered as metabolically healthy obese (MHO), has a reduced risk of metabolic complications. However, the molecular basis contributing to this healthy phenotype remains unclear. The objective of this work was to identify obesity-related metabolite patterns differed between MHO and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) groups and examine whether these patterns are associated with the development of cardiometabolic disorders in a sample of Iranian adult population aged 18-50 years. Valid metabolites were defined as metabolites that passed the quality control analysis of the study. In this case-control study, 104 valid metabolites of 107 MHO and 100 MUHO patients were separately compared to those of 78 normal-weight metabolically healthy (NWMH) adults. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate all potential relations in the study. A targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was employed to profile plasma metabolites. The study revealed that, after Bonferroni correction, branched-chain amino-acids, tyrosine, glutamic acid, diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:1 and C38:3 were directly and acyl-carnitine C18:2, acyl-lysophosphatidylcholines C18:1 and C18:2, and alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholines C18.0 were inversely associated with MHO phenotype. The same patterns were observed in MUHO patients except for the acyl-carnitine and lysophosphatidylcholine profiles where acyl-carnitine C3:0 and acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine C16:1 were higher and acyl-lysophosphatidylcholines C18:1, C18:2 were lower in this phenotype. Furthermore, proline, and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:2 and C34:2 were directly and serine, asparagines, and acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine C34:3 were negatively linked to MUHO group. Factors composed of amino acids were directly and those containing lysophosphatidylcholines were inversely related to cardiometabolic biomarkers in both phenotypes. Interestingly, the diacyl-phosphatidylcholines-containing factor was directly associated with cardiometabolic disorders in the MUHO group. A particular pattern of amino acids and choline-containing phospholipids may aid in the identification of metabolic health among obese patients."

We then screened for bio-markers in the blood and urine of the patients with PBC. Data were processed by Bruker ProfileAnalysis metabonomic software and imported to SIMCA-P software, which utilized principal component analysis (PCA) to create models of patients with PBC and healthy controls. In total, 18 urinary markers were found and the levels of 11 of these urinary markers were elevated in the patients with PBC, whereas the levels of the remaining 7 markers were lower in the PBC group compared to the control group. We also identified 20 blood-based biomarkers in the patients with PBC and the levels of 9 of these markers were higher in the PBC group, whereas the levels of the remaining 11 markers were lower in the patients with PBC compared to the controls. Among these biomarkers, the levels of bile acids increased with the progression of PBC, while the levels of carnitines, such as propionyl carnitine and butyryl carnitine, decreased with the progression of PBC. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that the circulating levels of bile acids and carnitine are differentially altered in patients with PBC."

                "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a master transcriptional regulator of beta-oxidation and a prominent target of hypolipidemic drugs. To gain deeper insights into the systemic consequences of impaired fat catabolism, we used quantitative, mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling to investigate the fed-to-fasted transition in PPARalpha(+/+) and PPARalpha(-/-) mice. Compared to PPARalpha(+/+) animals, acylcarnitine profiles of PPARalpha(-/-) mice revealed 2- to 4-fold accumulation of long-chain species in the plasma, whereas short-chain species were reduced by as much as 69% in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle. These results reflect a metabolic bottleneck downstream of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation. Organic and amino acid profiles of starved PPARalpha(-/-) mice suggested compromised citric acid cycle flux, enhanced urea cycle activity, and increased amino acid catabolism. PPARalpha(-/-) mice had 40-50% lower plasma and tissue levels of free carnitine, corresponding with diminished hepatic expression of genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis and transport. One week of oral carnitine supplementation conferred partial metabolic recovery in the PPARalpha(-/-) mice. In summary, comprehensive metabolic profiling revealed novel biomarkers of defective fat oxidation, while also highlighting the potential value of supplemental carnitine as a therapy and diagnostic tool for metabolic disorders."

                "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are inherited disorders of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. The defective digestion of GAGs within the intralysosomal compartment of affected patients leads to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from cardiovascular disease to neurological impairment. The molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease downstream of the genetic mutation of genes encoding for lysosomal enzymes still remain unclear. Here, we applied a targeted metabolomic approach to a mouse model of PS IIIB, using a platform dedicated to the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, in order to identify amino acid and fatty acid metabolic pathway alterations or the manifestations of other metabolic phenotypes. Our analysis highlighted an increase in the levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: Val, Ile, and Leu), aromatic amino acids (Tyr and Phe), free carnitine, and acylcarnitines in the liver and heart tissues of MPS IIIB mice as compared to the wild type (WT). Moreover, Ala, Met, Glu, Gly, Arg, Orn, and Cit amino acids were also found upregulated in the liver of MPS IIIB mice. These findings show a specific impairment of the BCAA and fatty acid catabolism in the heart of MPS IIIB mice. In the liver of affected mice, the glucose-alanine cycle and urea cycle resulted in being altered alongside a deregulation of the BCAA metabolism. Thus, our data demonstrate that an accumulation of BCAAs occurs secondary to lysosomal GAG storage, in both the liver and the heart of MPS IIIB mice. Since BCAAs regulate the biogenesis of lysosomes and autophagy mechanisms through mTOR signaling, impacting on lipid metabolism, this condition might contribute to the progression of the MPS IIIB disease."

Metabolomic investigations may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). STEMI patients were comprehensively examined via targeted metabolomic profiling, machine learning and weighted correlation network analysis. A total of 195 subjects, including 68 STEMI patients, 84 patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) and 43 non-CVD patients, were enrolled in the study. Metabolomic profiling involving the quantitative analysis of 87 endogenous metabolites in plasma was conducted. This study is the first to perform targeted metabolomic profiling in patients with STEMI. We identified 36 significantly altered metabolites in STEMI patients. Increased levels of four amino acids, eight acylcarnitines, six metabolites of the NO-urea cycle and neurotransmitters, and three intermediates of tryptophan metabolism were detected. The following metabolites exhibited decreased levels: six amino acids, three acylcarnitines, three components of the NO-urea cycle and neurotransmitters, and three intermediates of tryptophan metabolism. We found that the significant changes in tryptophan metabolism observed in STEMI patients-the increase in anthranilic acid and tryptophol and decrease in xanthurenic acid and 3-OH-kynurenine-may play important roles in STEMI pathogenesis. On the basis of the differences in the constructed weighted correlation networks, new significant metabolite ratios were identified. Among the 22 significantly altered metabolite ratios identified, 13 were between STEMI patients and non-CVD patients, and 17 were between STEMI patients and SAP patients. Seven of these ratios were common to both comparisons (STEMI patients vs. non-CVD patients and STEMI patients vs. SAP patients). Additionally, two ratios were consistently observed among the STEMI, SAP and non-CVD groups (anthranilic acid: aspartic acid and GSG (glutamine: serine\u2009+\u2009glycine)). These findings provide new insight into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of STEMI."

MT1 and MT2 gene knockout (MTKO) mice show shorter lifespans than wild-type (WT) mice. In this study, we aimed to investigate how MT gene deficiency accelerates aging. We performed comparative metabolomic analyses of plasma between MTKO and WT male mice at middle age (50-week-old) and advanced age (100-week-old) using liquid chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS). The concentration of N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine (TML), which is a metabolic intermediate in carnitine biosynthesis, was consistently higher in the plasma of MTKO mice compared to that of WT mice at middle and advanced age. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed remarkably lower mRNA levels of Tmlhe, which encodes TML dioxygenase, in the liver and kidney of male MTKO mice compared to that of WT mice. L-carnitine is essential for \u03b2-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in mitochondria, the activity of which is closely related to aging. Our results suggest that reduced carnitine biosynthesis capacity in MTKO mice compared to WT mice led to metabolic disorders of fatty acids in mitochondria in MTKO mice, which may have caused shortened lifespans."

The participants' nutritional status was assessed using the Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-score. Extended metabolic screening (EMS) was performed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy system to evaluate the levels of 14 amino acids, free carnitine, and 27 carnitine esters.

                "abstract": "World blindness is primarily caused by glaucoma. It has been predicted that by 2040, 118 million individuals will have glaucoma. Among Asians and Africans, primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is the most prevalent type of glaucoma, for which treatment options are currently very limited. At present, lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the primary approach for PACG treatment. However, some PACG patients with decreased IOP measurements still advance. Additionally, because of the complicated pathophysiology, there are no biomarkers for diagnosis. Metabolomics is the study of the metabolites produced by all cellular processes in a biological sample, providing a method for identifying biomarkers and early diagnosis. Nevertheless, metabolomics has infrequently been applied to PACG. Previous research conducted by our lab on plasma metabolite fatty acids in PACG patients revealed reduced free fatty acid (FFA) levels, which may be connected to lipid peroxidation. To ascertain the relationship between other metabolites and PACG. We compared levels of amino acids and carnitine in patients with PACG (n\u00a0=\u00a0147) and non-glaucoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0340). Using metabolomics analysis, twenty-one amino acids and twenty-six carnitines (a total of ninety-six indicators) were examined. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these metabolites in relation to PACG were calculated. The relationship between ocular measures and metabolites was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation. Predictive performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The C8/C2 level was comparable across patients with PACG and individuals without glaucoma based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The PACG group had lower levels of Arginine (Arg), Ornithine (Orn), Arg/Orn, Orn/Cit, and C26/C20 than the nonglaucoma group, whereas Cit/Arg and C4/C2 ratios were greater. Both univariate and multivariate models showed a negative correlation between Orn and Orn/Cit and PACG. In the univariate model, palmitoylcarnitine (C16) had a negative correlation with PACG. According to our findings, metabolic profiles of plasma amino acids and carnitine between PACG patients and controls are different. The combination of amino acids and carnitine increased the predictive value of PACG. The Orn and Arg were negatively correlated with the local ocular neurodegenerative pathology. We speculate lipid peroxidation may explain the reduction in C16, and the decrease in Orn may be associated with hyperammonia neurotoxicity."

Recently, the reprogramming of macrophages to an immunoregulatory phenotype has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for RA. Here, we report metabolically engineered exosomes that have been surface-modified for the targeted reprogramming of macrophages. Qualified exosomes were readily harvested from metabolically engineered stem cells by tangential flow filtration at a high yield while maintaining their innate immunomodulatory components. When systemically administered into mice with collagen-induced arthritis, these exosomes effectively accumulated in the inflamed joints, inducing a cascade of anti-inflammatory events via macrophage phenotype regulation. The level of therapeutic efficacy obtained with bare exosomes was achievable with the engineered exosomes of 10 times less dose. On the basis of the boosted nature to reprogram the synovial microenvironment, the engineered exosomes display considerable potential to be developed as a next-generation drug for RA."

Herein, we report the development of stimuli-responsive TolDex that induces lesion-specific immunoregulation in RA. Responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), a physiological stimulus in the RA microenvironment, was conferred on TolDex by introducing a thioketal (TK) linker-embedded poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on TolDex surface via hydrophobic insertion. The detachment of PEG following overproduction of ROS facilitates the cellular uptake of ROS-responsive TolDex (TKDex) into activated immune cells. Notably, TolDex and TKDex downregulated CD40 in mature dendritic cells (mDCs) and regulated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) at the cellular level. In the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, PEG prolonged the blood circulation of TKDex following intravenous administration and enhanced their accumulation in the joints. In addition, TKDex decreased IL-6, increased transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and induced the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in CIA mice. Overall, ROS-responsive TolDex might have potential as therapeutic agents for RA. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Tolerogenic dendritic cell-derived exosomes (TolDex) are emerging immunoregulators of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, their lack of long-term stability and low targetability are still challenging. To overcome these issues, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive TolDex (TKDex) by incorporating the ROS-sensitive functional group-embedded poly(ethylene glycol) linker into the exosomal membrane of TolDex. Surface-engineered TKDex were internalized in mature DCs because of high ROS-sensitivity and enhanced accumulation in the inflamed joint in vivo. Further, for the first time, we investigated the potential mechanism of action of TolDex relevant to CD40 downregulation and attenuation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 secretion. Our strategy highlighted the promising nanotherapeutic effects of stimuli-sensitive TolDex, which induces immunoregulation."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Exosomes are small, membrane-bound vesicles secreted by cells into the extracellular environment. They play a crucial role in various biological processes, including immune response, cell-to-cell signaling, and tumor progression. Exosomes have attracted attention as potential targets for therapeutic intervention, drug delivery, and biomarker detection. In this study, we aimed to isolate exosomes from human RA fibroblasts (hRAF-Exo) and load them with triptolide (TP) to generate engineered exosomes (hRAF-Exo@TP). METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy, particle size analysis, and western blotting for protein detection were employed to characterize hRAF-Exo. Furthermore, a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was employed to observe the distinct affinity of hRAF-Exo@TP towards the afflicted area. RESULTS: Cellular experiments demonstrated the inhibitory effect of hRAF-Exo@TP on the proliferative activity of human RA fibroblasts. Additionally, it exhibited remarkable selectivity for lesion sites in a CIA mouse model. CONCLUSION: Exosomes loaded with TP may enhance the therapeutic effects on RA in mice. Our study provides a promising avenue for the treatment of RA in the future."

                "abstract": "Only a minority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients achieve disease remission, so the exploration of additional pathogenic factors and the development of new therapeutics are needed. Here, strong correlations among the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level and the inflammatory response in clinical synovial fluid samples and RA disease activity are discovered. The important role of cfDNA in disease development in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) murine model is also demonstrated. Building on these findings, a novel therapeutic based on anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage-derived exosomes as chassis, that are modified with both oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the membrane, is developed. After intravenous injection, PEG-enabled prolonged circulation and C\u2500C motif chemokine ligand-directed accumulation together result in enrichment at inflamed joints. Following subsequent MMP cleavage, the positively charged oligolysine is exposed for cfDNA scavenging, while exosomes induce M2 polarization. By using a classical CIA murine model and a newly established CIA canine model, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed exosome therapeutic substantially suppresses inflammation in joints and provides strong chondroprotection and osteoprotection, revealing its potential for effective CIA amelioration."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-lasting intractable autoimmune disorder, which has become a substantial public health problem. Despite widespread use of biologic drugs, there have been uncertainties in efficacy and long-term safety. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a promising alternative for the treatment of RA because of their immunomodulatory properties. However, the precise mechanisms of MSCs on RA-related immune cells are not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) as a new therapeutic strategy for patients with RA and to explore the mechanisms underlying hUCB-MSC-mediated immunomodulation. Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were administered with hUCB-MSCs after the onset of disease, and therapeutic efficacy was assessed. Systemic delivery of hUCB-MSCs significantly ameliorated the severity of CIA to a similar extent observed in the etanercept-treated group. hUCB-MSCs exerted this therapeutic effect by regulating macrophage function. To verify the regulatory effects of hUCB-MSCs on macrophages, macrophages were co-cultured with hUCB-MSCs. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-mediated activation of cyclooxygenase-2 and TNF-stimulated gene/protein 6 in hUCB-MSCs polarized naive macrophages toward an M2 phenotype. In addition, hUCB-MSCs down-regulated the activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin 3 inflammasome via a paracrine loop of interleukin-1\u03b2 signaling. These immune-balancing effects of hUCB-MSCs were reproducible in co-culture experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active RA. hUCB-MSCs can simultaneously regulate multiple cytokine pathways in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines elevated in RA microenvironment, suggesting that treatment with hUCB-MSCs could be an attractive candidate for patients with treatment-refractory RA."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a severe inflammatory joint disorder, and several studies have taken note of the probability that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in RA pathogenesis. MiR-146 and miR-155 arose as primary immune response regulators. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) immunomodulatory function is primarily regulated by paracrine factors, such as exosomes. Exosomes, which serve as carriers of genetic information in cell-to-cell communication, transmit miRNAs between cells and have been studied as vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic molecules. AIMS: The current research aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of miR-146a/miR-155 transduced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)-derived exosomes on the immune response. METHODS: Here, exosomes were extracted from normal MSCs with over-expressed miR-146a/miR-155; Splenocytes were isolated from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and control mice. Expression levels miR-146a and miR-155 were then monitored. Flow cytometry was performed to assess the impact of the exosomes on regulatory T-cell (Treg) levels. Expression of some key autoimmune response genes and their protein products, including retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-\u03b3t, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-17, -6, -10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 in the Splenocytes was determined using both quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. The results showed that miR-146a was mainly down-regulated in CIA mice. Treatment with MSC-derived exosomes and miR-146a/miR-155-transduced MSC-derived exosomes significantly altered the CIA mice Treg cell levels compared to in control mice. RESULTS: Ultimately, such modulation may promote the recovery of appropriate T-cell responses in inflammatory situations such as RA. CONCLUSION: miR-146a-transduced MSC-derived exosomes also increased forkhead box P3 (Fox- P3), TGF\u03b2 and IL-10 gene expression in the CIA mice; miR-155 further increased the gene expressions of ROR\u03b3t, IL-17, and IL-6 in these mice. Based on the findings here, Exosomes appears to promote the direct intracellular transfer of miRNAs between cells and to represent a possible therapeutic strategy for RA. The manipulation of MSC-derived exosomes with anti-inflammatory miRNA may increase Treg cell populations and anti-inflammatory cytokines."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), one of the systemic autoimmune diseases, features dysregulated inflammation that can eventually lead to multi-joint destruction and deformity. Although current clinical RA treatment agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and biological agents can alleviate symptoms, there can be long-term drug dependence and considerable side effects. To promote the course of RA from inflammation to resolution and ultimately terminate the vicious cycle of recrudescence, it is important to regulate the pro-/anti-inflammatory abilities of macrophages for constructing an immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory microenvironment. Macrophage-derived exosomes can be homed or targeted to inflammatory tissues or cells; however, the insufficient anti-inflammatory abilities and intrinsic off-target effects of these exosomes often result in unsatisfactory treatment effects, which remains a challenge in the treatment of RA. Here, we proposed a novel kind of inherent anti-inflammatory exosome (AI-Exo), which was prepared via integrating RAW264.7 macrophage-derived exosomes and a powerful anti-inflammatory immune modulator interleukin-10 by an electroporation method. Then, non-invasive ultrasound was used to increase the permeability of blood vessels and augment the targeted accumulation of AI-Exo to inflammatory tissues, which could promote macrophage polarization to M2 phenotypes, relieve inflammation symptoms, stimulate resolution, and accelerate tissue repair against collagen-induced arthritis. This work intensely supports that ultrasound-augmented AI-Exo has significant targeted anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects, and the combined mechanism of anti-inflammation and pro-resolution gives unique insights into the treatment of not only RA but also other inflammatory diseases, which provides an effective strategy and a promising prospect for future wider biomedical applications and clinical transformations."

Here we encapsulated a plasmid DNA encoding the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10 pDNA) and the chemotherapeutic drug betamethasone sodium phosphate (BSP) into biomimetic vector M2 exosomes (M2 Exo) derived from M2-type macrophages. We demonstrate that the loaded exosomes target and reduce inflammation for combined therapy against RA. The in vitro efficiency of the M2 Exo/pDNA/BSP co-delivery system was attributed to the synergistic effect of IL-10 pDNA and BSP, which also promoted M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and increasing the expression of IL-10 cytokine. In a mouse model of RA, M2 Exo/pDNA/BSP showed good accumulation at inflamed joint sites, high anti-inflammatory activity, and potent therapeutic effect. The delivery system was non-toxic both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this system may serve as a promising biocompatible drug carrier and anti-inflammatory agent for RA treatment based on M1-to-M2 macrophage re-polarization."

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as an autoimmune illness is thought to be induced through a variety of genomic, physiological, and biological factors. Many experts in the field of nanomedicine have looked to stem cells as a viable strategy to repair human tissue; however, exosomes have demonstrated greater potential in recent years. Exosomes, produced from stem cells in particular, have exhibited a high propensity to give therapeutic effects. To resist local cellular stress, they are secreted in a paracrine manner from cells. As a result, exosomes produced from stem cells can provide enormous health uses. If treatment is not given, autoantibodies produce synovial inflammation and arthritis, which can lead to chronic inflammation, and impairment. Exosomes could be administered for the treatment of RA, by acting as therapeutic vectors. Exosomes are murine extracellular vesicles that influence biological mechanisms and signal transduction by transporting genetic and protein components. Diseases like RA and bone fractures could be treated using cell-free therapeutic strategies if exosomes could be isolated from stem cells efficiently and packaged with specific restorative substances. To get to this position, many breakthroughs must be achieved, and the following review summarises the most recent developments in stem cell-derived exosomes, with a focus on the important literature on exosome dynamics in RA."

Despite current therapeutic strategies such as non-steroidal drugs or anti-cytokine biologics having shown promise for RA management, their side effects and clinical response rate remain unsatisfactory, attributed largely to the complicated pathomechanisms and multiplicity of the inflammatory cytokines. In this work, novel hybrid exosome-mimic nanovesicles equipped with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity were developed for RA treatment. The hybrid nanovesicles (HNV) were prepared by fusing an M1 macrophage membrane into exosome-mimic nanovesicles extruded from M2 macrophages. The HNV inherit the anti-inflammatory properties of the M2 macrophages and cytokine receptors derived from the M1 membrane. Accordingly, the HNV possess comprehensive anti-inflammation activity via binding proinflammatory factors and releasing anti-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, black phosphorus nanosheets (BP) were introduced into the HNV (HNV@BP) to eliminate inflammatory cells upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, which intrinsically decreases the inflammatory reaction. In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, the HNV loaded with BP targeted and accumulated at the inflammed knee joints, exhibiting multimodal rheumatoid arthritis therapy combined with NIR irradiation through comprehensive inflammation suppression."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) have been shown to have remarkable immune-modulating effects. However, their efficacy in clinical trials has yet to be fully demonstrated. This could be due to a lack of a proper inflammatory environment in vivo that primes ADSC. Here, we define how the articular microenvironment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients modulates the therapeutic efficiency of ADSC. Methods: Synovial fluids (SF) were collected from 8 RA patients, 2 Spondyloarthritis patients and one control synovial fluid from a patient undergoing traumatic-related surgery. SF inflammatory status was determined by routine analysis and quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines. ADSC were first treated with SF and ADSC proliferation and gene expression of immunomodulatory factors was evaluated. In order to determine the mechanisms underlying the effect of SF on ADSC, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NF-\u03baB neutralization assays were performed. To evaluate the effect of SF on ADSC functions, ADSC were pre-treated with SF and then co-cultured with either macrophages or T cells. The modulation of their phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry. Results: Pro-inflammatory RASF maintained the proliferative capacity of ADSC and upregulated the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), indoleamine-1,2-dioxygenase (IDO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor-necrosis factor stimulated gene 6 (TSG6), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), all factors involved in ADSC immunomodulatory potential. The RASF-induced gene expression was mainly mediated by TNF alone or in combination with IL-6 and signaled through the NF-\u03baB pathway. Conditioning ADSC with pro-inflammatory RASF enhanced their ability to induce CD4+Foxp3+CD25high regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibit pro-inflammatory markers CD40 and CD80 in activated macrophages. Conclusions: Inflammatory synovial fluids from RA patients had the capacity to modulate ADSC response, to induce Tregs and modulate the phenotype of macrophages. The clinical use of ADSC in affected joints should take into account the influence of the local articular environment on their potential. Having a sufficient pro-inflammatory microenvironment will determine whether optimal immunoregulatory response should be expected. Direct ADSC intra-articular delivery to patients could be a potential strategy to properly prime their immunomodulatory potential and enhance their clinical benefits."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by synovial hyperplasia and chronic inflammation, which lead to the progressive destruction of cartilage and bone in the joints. Numerous studies have reported that administrations of various types of MSCs improve arthritis symptoms in animal models, by paracrine mechanisms. However, the therapeutic effects of the secreted factors alone, without the cell graft, have been uncertain. Here, we show that a single intravenous administration of serum-free conditioned medium (CM) from human deciduous dental pulp stem cells (SHED-CM) into anti-collagen type II antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA), a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), markedly improved the arthritis symptoms and joint destruction. The therapeutic efficacy of SHED-CM was associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in the CAIA joints and the abrogation of RANKL expression. SHED-CM specifically depleted of an M2 macrophage inducer, the secreted ectodomain of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-9 (ED-Siglec-9), exhibited a reduced ability to induce M2-related gene expression and attenuate CAIA. SHED-CM also inhibited the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Collectively, our findings suggest that SHED-CM provides multifaceted therapeutic effects for treating CAIA, including the ED-Siglec-9-dependent induction of M2 macrophage polarization and inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, SHED-CM may represent a novel anti-inflammatory and reparative therapy for RA. "

We herein developed folic acid modified silver nanoparticles (FA-AgNPs) that can actively deliver into M1 macrophages to synergistically induce M1 macrophages reduction and M2 macrophages polarization for effective RA treatment. The AgNPs was facilely prepared, PEGylated and modified with FA to realize M1 macrophages targeting delivery via folate receptor overexpressed on M1 macrophages surface. After entering cells, FA-AgNPs dissolved and released Ag+ in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH), which is the key element to exert a series of anti-inflammatory functions, such as M1 macrophages apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging to facilitate M2 macrophages polarization, both of which contributed to RA treatment. This nano-system could passively accumulate into inflamed joints, permit potent anti-inflammatory activity, and impose strong therapeutic efficacy in mice RA models with high biosafety. After treatment, FA-AgNPs could be gradually cleared from the body mainly via feces without tissue accumulation, and did not show any appreciable long-term toxicity. This work declares the first example of using bio-active nanoparticles for RA treatment without loading any drugs, and highlights the potential of FA-AgNPs for targeted RA therapy via simultaneous M1 macrophage apoptosis and M1-to-M2 macrophages re-polarization."

The homing ability of MSCs is unique compared with that of non-migrating cells and MSCs are considered promising therapeutic vectors for targeting major cells in many pathophysiological sites. MSCs have many advantages in the treatment of malignant diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a representative autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints, and secreted chemokines in the joints are well recognized by MSCs following their migration to the joints. Furthermore, MSCs can regulate the inflammatory process and repair damaged cells in the joints. However, the functionality and migration ability of MSCs injected in vivo still show insufficient. The targeting ability and migration efficiency of MSCs can be enhanced by genetic engineering or modification, eg, overexpressing chemokine receptors or migration-related genes, thus maximizing their therapeutic effect. However, there are concerns about genetic changes due to the increased probability of oncogenesis resulting from genome integration of the viral vector, and thus, clinical application is limited. Furthermore, it is suspected that administering MSCs can promote tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft and orthotopic models. For this reason, MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are an alternative strategy that does not involve using MSCs or bioengineered MSCs. MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations consist of MSC membrane-coated nanoparticles, MSC-derived exosomes and artificial ectosomes, and MSC membrane-fused liposomes with natural or genetically engineered MSC membranes. MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations not only retain the targeting ability of MSCs but also have many advantages in terms of targeted drug delivery. Specifically, MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are capable of encapsulating drugs with various components, including chemotherapeutic agents, nucleic acids, and proteins. Furthermore, there are fewer concerns over safety issues on MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations associated with mutagenesis even when using genetically engineered MSCs, because MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations use only the membrane fraction of MSCs. Genetic engineering is a promising route in clinical settings, where nano-encapsulated technology strategies are combined. In this review, the mechanism underlying MSC homing and the advantages of MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are discussed. In addition, genetic engineering of MSCs and MSC mimicking nanoencapsulation is described as a promising strategy for the treatment of immune-related diseases."

Inspired by the intrinsic inflammation-targeting capacity of macrophages, a macrophage-derived microvesicle (MMV)-coated nanoparticle (MNP) was developed for targeting RA. The MMV was efficiently produced through a novel method. Cytochalasin B (CB) was applied to relax the interaction between the cytoskeleton and membrane of macrophages, thus stimulating MMV secretion. The proteomic profile of the MMV was analyzed by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). The MMV membrane proteins were similar to those of macrophages, indicating that the MMV could exhibit bioactivity similar to that of RA-targeting macrophages. A poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle was subsequently coated with MMV, and the inflammation-mediated targeting capacity of the MNP was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro binding of MNP to inflamed HUVECs was significantly stronger than that of the red blood cell membrane-coated nanoparticle (RNP). Compared with bare NP and RNP, MNP showed a significantly enhanced targeting effect in vivo in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. The targeting mechanism was subsequently revealed according to the proteomic analysis, indicating that Mac-1 and CD44 contributed to the outstanding targeting effect of the MNP. A model drug, tacrolimus, was encapsulated in MNP (T-RNP) and significantly suppressed the progression of RA in mice. The present study demonstrates MMV as a promising and rich material, with which to mimic macrophages, and demonstrates that MNP is an efficient biomimetic vehicle for RA targeting and treatment."

Although human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSC) have the potential to be used in treating RA, GMSC-based therapy has some inevitable side effects such as immunogenicity and tumorigenicity. As one of the most important paracrine mediators, GMSC-derived exosomes (GMSC-Exo) exhibit therapeutic effects via immunomodulation in a variety of disease models, bypassing potential shortcomings of the direct use of MSCs. Furthermore, exosomes are not sensitive to freezing and thawing, and can be readily available for use.

We herein compare the immunomodulatory functions of GMSC-Exo and GMSC in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and in vitro CD4+ T-cell co-culture model. The results show that GMSC-Exo has the same or stronger effects compared with GMSC in inhibiting IL-17A and promoting IL-10, reducing incidences and bone erosion of arthritis, via inhibiting IL-17RA-Act1-TRAF6-NF-\u03baB signal pathway.

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\u00a0is one of the most common chronic autoimmune diseases. Despite considerable advances in clinical treatment of RA, suboptimal response to therapy and treatment discontinuation are still unresolved challenges due to systemic toxicity. It is of crucial importance to actively target and deliver therapeutic agents to inflamed joints in order to promote in situ activity and decrease systemic toxicity. In this study, we found that SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) was overexpressed in the synovial fluid and synovium of RA patients as well as mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which has been scarcely reported. Building upon the SPARC signature of RA joint microenvironment and the intrinsic high affinity of SPARC for albumin, we fabricated methotrexate-loaded human serum albumin nanomedicines (MTX@HSA NMs) and explored them as biomimetic drug delivery systems for RA therapy. Upon intravenous injection of chlorin e6-labeled MTX@HSA NMs into CIA mice, the fluorescence/magnetic resonance dual-modal imaging revealed higher accumulations and longer retention of MTX@HSA NMs in inflamed joints with respect to free MTX molecules. In vivo therapeutic evaluations suggested that the MTX@HSA NMs were able to attenuate the progression of RA with better efficacy and fewer side effects even at half\u00a0 dose of administrated MTX in comparison with free MTX. By unraveling the mechanism driving the efficient accumulation of MTX@HSA NMs in RA joints and showing their ability to improve the safety and therapeutic efficacy of MTX, our work sheds light on the development of innovative anti-RA nanomedicines with a strong potential for clinical translation."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mediation of RNA interference by oligonucleotides constitutes a powerful approach for the silencing of genes involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease, but in vivo application of this technique requires effective delivery to immune cells and/or sites of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to develop a new carrier system to mediate systemic administration of oligonucleotides to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joints, and to develop an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based approach to interfere with CD40-CD154 interactions in an experimental model of RA. METHODS: A novel liposomal carrier with amphoteric properties, termed Nov038, was developed and assessed for its ability to systemically deliver an ASO directed against CD40 (CD40-ASO). Male DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis were treated with Nov038-encapsulated CD40-ASO, and the effects of treatment on various parameters of disease activity, including clinical score, paw swelling, lymph node responses, and inflammatory cytokine production in the joints, were assessed. RESULTS: Nov038 was well tolerated, devoid of immune-stimulatory effects, and efficacious in mediating systemic oligonucleotide delivery to sites of inflammation. In mice with collagen-induced arthritis, Nov038 enabled the therapeutic administration of CD40-ASO and improved established disease, while unassisted CD40-ASO was ineffective, and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) treatment was less effective in this model. Nov038/CD40-ASO efficacy was attributed to its tropism for monocyte/macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in rapid down-regulation of CD40, inhibition of DC antigen presentation, and reduction in collagen-specific T cell responses, as well as decreased levels of TNFalpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-17 in arthritic joints. CONCLUSION: Amphoteric liposomes represent a novel carrier concept for systemic and antigen-presenting cell-targeted oligonucleotide delivery with clinical applicability and numerous potential applications, including target validation in vivo and inflammatory disease therapeutics. Moreover, Nov038/CD40-ASO constitutes a potent alternative to monoclonal antibody-based approaches for interfering with CD40-CD40L interactions."

                "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthropathy associated with articular damage and attendant comorbidities. Even although RA treatment has advanced remarkably over the last decade, a significant proportion of patients still do not achieve sustained remission. The cause of RA is not yet known despite the many potential mechanisms proposed. It has been confirmed that RA is associated with dysregulated immune system and persistent inflammation. Therefore, management of inflammation is always the target of therapy. Sinomenine (SIN) is the prescription drug approved by the Chinese government for RA treatment. A previous study found that SIN was a robust anti-inflammation drug. In this study, we screened the different secretory cytokines using inflammation antibody arrays and qRT-PCR in both LPS-induced and SIN-treated RAW264.7 cells followed by evaluation of the ability of SIN to modulate cytokine secretion in a cell model, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, and RA patients. Several clinical indexes affecting the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) were determined before and after SIN treatment. Clinical indexes, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and DAS28 were compared among RA patients treated with either SIN or methotrexate (MTX). To explore the mechanism of SIN anti-inflammatory function, RA-associated monocyte/macrophage subsets were determined using flow cytometry in CIA mouse model and RA patients, both treated with SIN. The results demonstrated that SIN regulated IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-12 p40, IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, KC (CXCL1), Eotaxin-2, IL-10, M-CSF, RANTES, and MCP-1 secretion in vivo and in vitro and reduced RA activity and DAS28 in a clinical setting. Furthermore, SIN attenuated CD11b+F4/80+CD64+ resident macrophages in the synovial tissue, CD11b+Ly6C+CD43+ macrophages in the spleen and draining lymph nodes of CIA mice. The percentage of CD14+CD16+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reduced by SIN in RA patients. These data indicated that SIN regulates the secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines and monocyte/macrophage subsets, thereby suppressing RA progression. Therefore, along with MTX, SIN could be an alternative cost-effective anti-inflammatory agent for treating RA."

                "abstract": "Fibroblast-derived exosomes have been reported to transfer microRNAs to recipient cells, where they regulate target gene expression, which is of interest for understanding the basic biology of inflammation, tissue homeostasis, and development of therapeutic approaches. Initial microarray-based analysis carried out in this study identified the rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related differentially expressed gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Subsequently, the upstream regulatory microRNA-106b (miR-106b) of PDK4 was predicted with bioinformatic analyses. A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)-induced mouse model was established, and exosomes were isolated from synovial fibroblasts (SFs) and transferred into chondrocytes to identify the role of exosomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that PDK4 was poorly expressed in RA cartilage tissues and chondrocytes, while miR-106b was highly expressed in RA SFs and SF-derived exosomes. Notably, PDK4 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-106b. Over-expression of PDK4 promoted the proliferation and migration abilities of chondrocytes and inhibited their apoptosis as well as affected the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system. Meanwhile, miR-106b was delivered from SFs to chondrocytes through exosomes, which suppressed chondrocyte proliferation and migration and accelerated apoptosis as well as affected the RANKL/RANK/OPG system via down-regulation of PDK4. Furthermore, in vivo results validated that miR-106b inhibition could relieve CIA-induced RA. Taken together, SF-derived exosomal miR-106b stimulates RA initiation by targeting PDK4, indicating a physiologically validated potential approach for the prevention and treatment of RA. KEY MESSAGES: PDK4 is decreased in chondrocytes of RA, while miR-106b is increased in SFBs. PDK4 promotes proliferation and migration of chondrocytes. miR-106b could target 3'UTR of PDK4 gene. SFB-exosomal miR-106b inhibits proliferation and migration of chondrocytes. Inhibition of miR-106b attenuates RA progression in a CIA mouse model."

            "abstract": "Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a hypermelanosis that often occurs secondary to skin irritation or injury, especially in darker skin tones, for which there is currently a lack of effective treatment options. Few preclinical models are available to study PIH. Here, we show that the Yucatan miniature pig consistently develops PIH after skin injuries. Skin wounds were produced on Yucatan pigs by needle punches, full-thickness excisions, or burns. Wound sites were monitored and photographed regularly. Tissue samples were collected after 24\u2009weeks and processed for histology/immunohistochemistry. Skin pigmentation and histologic changes were quantified by computer-assisted image analyses. All injury methods resulted in hyperpigmentation. Melanin content at the histologic level was quantified in the larger (burn and excision) wounds, showing a significant increase compared to uninjured skin. Increased melanin was found for both epidermal and dermal regions. Dermal melanin deposits were primarily clustered around the papillary vasculature, and were associated not with melanocytes but with leukocytes. The Yucatan miniature pig model recapitulates key clinical and histologic features of PIH in humans, including skin hyperpigmentation at both gross and histologic levels, and persistence of dermal melanin subsequent to injury. This model could be used to further our understanding of the etiology of PIH, and for new therapy development."

                "abstract": "Using a validated swine model of human scar formation, hyperpigmented and hypopigmented scar samples were examined for their histological and optical properties to help elucidate the mechanisms and characteristics of dyspigmentation. Full-thickness wounds were created on the flanks of red Duroc pigs and allowed to heal. Biopsies from areas of hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, and uninjured tissue were fixed and embedded for histological examination using Azure B and primary antibodies to S100B, HMB45, and \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH). Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) was then used to examine the optical properties of scars. Hyperpigmentation was first noticeable in healing wounds around weeks 2 to 3, gradually becoming darker. There was no significant difference in S100B staining for the presence of melanocytes between hyperpigmented and hypopigmented scar samples. Azure B staining of melanin was significantly greater in histological sections from hyperpigmented areas than in sections from both uninjured skin and hypopigmented scar (P < .0001). There was significantly greater staining for \u03b1-MSH in hyperpigmented samples compared with hypopigmented samples (P = .0121), and HMB45 staining was positive for melanocytes in hyperpigmented scar. SFDI at a wavelength of 632 nm resulted in an absorption coefficient map correlating with visibly hyperpigmented areas of scars. In a red Duroc model of hypertrophic scar formation, melanocyte number is similar in hyperpigmented and hypopigmented tissues. Hyperpigmented tissues, however, show a greater amount of melanin and \u03b1-MSH, along with immunohistochemical evidence of stimulated melanocytes. These observations encourage further investigation of melanocyte stimulation and the inflammatory environment within a wound that may influence melanocyte activity. Additionally, SFDI can be used to identify areas of melanin content in mature, pigmented scars, which may lead to its usefulness in wounds at earlier time points before markedly apparent pigmentation abnormalities."

                "abstract": "Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a common cutaneous condition that can cause a disfigured appearance. However, the pathophysiology of PIH remains poorly understood, at least in part, because an appropriate animal model for research has not been established. In order to analyze the pathomechanism of PIH, we successfully induced PIH in a hairless version of transgenic mice (hk14-SCF Tg/HRM) that have a human-type epidermis containing melanin by repeated hapten application of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. Histopathologic observation showed epidermal hyperplasia, predominant infiltrations of inflammatory cells, and melanin-containing cells in the dermis just after elicitation of the atopic dermatitis-like condition. At week 2, the findings were similar to the characteristics of PIH, that is, an increase of melanin without spongiosis or liquid degeneration in the epidermis and an increase in dermal melanophages. Dynamic analysis of melanin showed that the melanin in the dermis remained for a longer duration than in the epidermis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the majority of cells containing melanin were positive for the anti-CD68 antibody, but negative for the anti-F4/80 antibody. These data suggest that novel treatments of PIH should be targeted against macrophages and should eventually lead to the development of new treatment modalities."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current safety standards for lasers operating in the 1,400- to 2,000-nanometer (nm) wavelength region are based on only a few observations at specific wavelengths. On the basis of experimental results conducted with Yorkshire pigs (Sus scrofa domestica), these standards may not accurately reflect the potential for laser injury when humans are exposed to these wavelengths. It is our belief that one of the damage mechanisms involved in these laser injuries results from energy absorption by skin pigmentation (melanin), and a more highly pigmented animal model, the Yucatan hairless minipig, may be a more suitable subject for laser exposure studies. METHODS: Skin specimens were collected from Yorkshire pigs and Yucatan minipigs for histologic examination, and the thickness of the epidermis was measured. Epidermal thickness of human skin also was determined, and a qualitative assessment of the melanin content in the epidermal layers was conducted. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD thicknesses of the Yucatan minipig flank and dorsal neck epidermis were 68 +/- 34 and 68 +/- 25 microm, respectively. Thicknesses of the Yucatan minipig skin were closely comparable to the thicknesses of human epidermis from the face (68 +/- 26 microm), neck (65 +/- 24 microm) and arms (68 +/- 21 microm). The Yorkshire pig lacks substantial melanin in the epidermis, whereas the skin of the Yucatan minipig is more similar to that of humans. CONCLUSION: On the basis of epidermal skin thickness measurements and melanin assessment, the flank and dorsal neck of the Yucatan minipig are better suited to laser injury studies than are the Yorkshire pig models of human skin."

                "abstract": "There are limited treatments for dyschromia in burn hypertrophic scars (HTSs). Initial work in Duroc pig models showed that regions of scar that are light or dark have equal numbers of melanocytes. This study aims to confirm melanocyte presence in regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation in an animal model and patient samples. In a Duroc pig model, melanocyte presence was confirmed using en face staining. Patients with dyschromic HTSs had demographic, injury details, and melanin indices collected. Punch biopsies were taken of regions of hyper-, hypo-, or normally pigmented scar and skin. Biopsies were processed to obtain epidermal sheets (ESs). A subset of ESs were en face stained with melanocyte marker, S100\u03b2. Melanocytes were isolated from a different subset. Melanocytes were treated with NDP \u03b1-MSH, a pigmentation stimulator. mRNA was isolated from cells, and was used to evaluate gene expression of melanin-synthetic genes. In patient and pig scars, regions of hyper-, hypo-, and normal pigmentation had significantly different melanin indices. S100\u03b2 en face staining showed that regions of hyper- and hypo-pigmentation contained the same number of melanocytes, but these cells had different dendricity/activity. Treatment of hypo-pigmented melanocytes with NDP \u03b1-MSH produced melanin by microscopy. Melanin-synthetic genes were upregulated in treated cells over controls. While traditionally it may be thought that hypopigmented regions of burn HTS display this phenotype because of the absence of pigment-producing cells, these data show that inactive melanocytes are present in these scar regions. By treating with a pigment stimulator, cells can be induced to re-pigment."

Our hypothesis was that pigmentation would play a significant role in skin energy absorption at 3.8 microm. Previous studies comparing pigmented and lightly pigmented porcine skin with human skin found that compared with Yorkshire pigs, Yucatan minipigs were a superior model for laser skin exposure because of their higher pigmentation levels. In the current study, 10 pigs under general anesthesia were exposed to 3.8-microm laser pulses ranging from 0.01 J/cm2 to 93 J/cm2. Gross examinations and skin biopsies were done 24 h after laser exposure, and histologic examinations were conducted on these tissue samples. The 24-h effective dose (ED50) was determined to be 4.5 J/cm2 for Yucatan mini-pigs and 2.6 J/cm2 for Yorkshire pigs. As deposited energy was increased, the lesion presentation progressed from desiccation of the superficial layer of epidermis (4 J/cm2) to desiccation with inflammatory centers (14 J/cm2), and finally to replacement of inflammatory areas with an epidermal ulcerated central area (=21 J/cm2). Therefore we found no statistical difference between the 24-h ED50 of the 2 breeds of pigs, nor was there any difference in histologic presentation at 24 h postexposure."

This is a naturally occurring breed of swine with light brown to dark brown skin that is relatively hairless. The skin morphology, including the pattern of pigment distribution, in this breed of swine closely resembles the human skin. Test compounds examined in this study included the three standard compounds with known clinical depigmenting activity, hydroquinone (HQ), 4-hydroxyanisole (4HA) and tert-butyl catechol (TBC), each at a 5% concentration. Test materials in 25 microliters of propylene glycol/ethanol (50:50) were applied topically twice daily, 7 days a week for 90 days to test sites on each side of the dorsal mid-line. Test sites were graded weekly for variation in pigmentation and local irritation. After 90 days of test material application, skin biopsies of the test sites were taken for histological evaluation. Topical application of HQ, 4HA and TBC promoted marked skin depigmentation which was substantiated by reductions of pigment and melanocytes observed on microscopic examination. While both HQ and TBC produced marked local irritation, 4HA was only mildly irritating. These results suggest that the Yucatan pig, could be a potentially useful model for screening compounds with skin depigmenting activity."

                "abstract": "CONTEXT: Despite new technologies, few studies have quantified changes in melanocyte numbers associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to exogenous causes. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to review what is known about the pathogenesis of PIH secondary to external insults and its relationship to the resultant degree of quantitative changes in melanocytes. METHODS: We performed a review of articles exploring PIH resulting from external cutaneous insults retrieved through database searching. We reviewed relevant articles for the pathogenesis, histopathology, and quantitative changes in melanocytes related to specific etiologies of PIH. Methodologies to quantify pigmentation changes in dermatologic conditions with clinical hyperpigmentation were also explored. RESULTS: Significant increases in melanocyte counts of irritant affected skin is seen compared with melanocyte counts of unaffected skin. An increase in melanocyte counts was also found for spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses, even in the absence of clinical hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, changes in melanocyte density and appearance are also seen secondary to inflammation. In addition, increases in epidermal melanocytes are seen with cutaneous exposure to certain agents, and melanocyte increases vary by exposure agent. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of hyperpigmentation related to the intensity and duration of exposure to the causative factors of PIH is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease process. The application of new methodologies to determine quantitative changes in melanocytes elicited by specific causative inflammatory agents has implications to prevent PIH, add to knowledge about disease duration, to develop better treatments for PIH, and to aid our understanding of the biology of the melanocyte."

AIMS: To observe the dynamic development of PIH; determine the starting point and peak point of the inflammatory phase and pigmentary phase; and clarify the timing of anti-inflammatory and anti-pigmentary treatment. METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers with Fitzpatrick skin types III-IV were enrolled and underwent suction blisters. The noninvasive evaluation of inflammation and hyperpigmentation on suction blister sites were performed via spectrophotometry (CM2600d and SIAscope) and RCM for the following 24\u00a0weeks. RESULTS: We successfully observed suction blister-induced PIH lasting over 24\u00a0weeks. The inflammatory phase started soon after the procedure and lasted for 8-12\u00a0weeks, manifested by significantly elevated a* values and erythema index detected by spectrophotometry, as well as inflammatory infiltration and angiogenesis shown in RCM images. Meanwhile, melanogenesis was accelerated after week 3 and reached peak on week 8, manifested by significantly accumulated melanin granules and bright pigment rings in different depths under RCM, which was in parallel with elevated melanin index. The darkening skin tone in PIH actually presented a mixture of inflammatory erythema, angiogenesis, and hyperpigmentation. The inflammation and pigmentation phases of PIH were not sequential but partially overlap. CONCLUSION: The duration of suction blister-induced PIH is more than 24\u00a0weeks. The inflammatory phase partially overlaps with the pigmentary phase, and those drugs with anti-inflammatory and anti-pigmentary dual effects are potential choices."

PIH is one of the most common complications of procedures performed using laser and other light sources. The severity of PIH is determined by the inherent skin color, degree and depth of inflammation, degree of dermoepidermal junction disruption, inflammatory conditions, and the stability of melanocytes, leading to epidermal and dermal melanin pigment deposition. The depth of melanin pigment is the key factor to predict prognosis and treatment outcome. Epidermal hyperpigmentation fades more rapidly than dermal hyperpigmentation. Various inflammatory disorders can eventually result in PIH. The evaluation of pigmentation using noninvasive tools helps define the level of pigmentation in the skin, pigmentation intensity, and guides therapeutic approaches. This first article in this 2-part series discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnoses, and investigation using noninvasive assessment techniques that objectively determine the details of pigmentation."

Therefore, the therapeutic strategies of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation are as follows: the former focuses on inhibiting the synthesis of melanin and reducing the content of melanin in the skin, while the latter can restore the normal skin color by improving the function of melanocytes to promote the synthesis of melanin. In recent years, the therapeutic technologies for abnormal melanin metabolism after burns have developed rapidly. In this paper, treatment strategies commonly used in clinical practice are summarized in terms of photoelectric therapies, drugs, and operations, aiming to provide references for the treatment of patients who suffer abnormal pigmentation after burns."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (laser) systems operating in the so-called \"eye safe\" region are gaining widespread use in industry, medicine, and military applications. This research effort was geared to study the effects of laser tissue interaction on human skin by using in vivo porcine skin as an animal model. The goals of the study were to determine the median effective dose (ED50) for 1540-nm laser exposures, to evaluate the Yorkshire pig and the Yucatan mini-pig as animal models for laser exposure, and to characterize laser-induced skin lesions histologically. METHODS: A 1540-nm wavelength laser was used to expose multiple sites on the flanks of 10 pigs, using 0.8-ms pulses, ranging from 7 to 96 joules (J)/cm2. Single pulses were delivered to the flank of Yorkshire and Yucatan pigs in a grid pattern. Exposure sites were evaluated immediately after exposure and at 1 hour and 24 hours for presence of gross lesions. Representative biopsy specimens were collected from lesion sites for histologic evaluation at the 24-hour endpoint. RESULTS: The ED50 for the two breeds differed in the amount of energy required to induce dermal lesions. Grossly, lesions in each breed were well demarcated and pale gray to brightly erythematous. Microscopically, lesions had epidermal layer damage as cellular swelling and nuclear pyknosis, loss of cellular detail, and coagulation necrosis at the dermal layer. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the presence of a different mechanism of laser-tissue damage in these two breeds. Photo-thermal mechanism appears to induce the skin lesions in the Yorkshire pig, whereas photo-thermal and photochemical mechanisms appear to be involved in lesion formation in the Yucatan mini-pig. All data obtained in this study will become part of database used by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to recommend laser safety standards for the occupational health and safety programs (OHSP), which will be used by industry and the military to base and update their current OHSP."

                "abstract": "Hyperpigmentation is a common complication in patients with burn injuries during wound healing; however, the mechanisms underlying its occurrence and development remain unclear. Recently, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) was found to result from overproduction of melanin. Local or systemic inflammatory responses are often observed in patients who develop hyperpigmentation. However, we lack studies on the relationship between PIH and burn injury. Therefore, we comprehensively reviewed the existing literature on the melanogenesis of the skin, inflammatory mechanisms in pigmentation, and local or systemic alteration in inflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from burn trauma to elucidate the relationship between PIH and burn injury. We believe that this review will guide further research on regulating melanin production in the burn management process."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have developed a light-activated technology for rapidly sealing skin surgical wounds called photochemical tissue bonding (PTB). The goals of this study were to evaluate parameters influencing PTB in order to optimize its clinical efficacy and to determine whether PTB can be used to seal wounds in moderately to highly pigmented skin. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Application of Rose Bengal (RB) followed by exposure to 532 nm was used to seal linear incisions (1.5 mm deep, 2 cm long) in lightly pigmented (Yorkshire) and darkly pigmented (Yucatan) swine skin. The force required to open the seal (the bonding strength) was measured by in situ tensiometry. Reflectance spectra, epidermal transmission spectra, and histology were used to characterize the skin. The relationships of RB concentration and fluence to bonding strength were established in Yorkshire skin. Surface temperature was measured during irradiations and cooling was used while sealing incisions in Yucatan skin. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to estimate the effect of epidermal melanin on the power absorbed in the dermis at the incision interface. RESULTS: The lowest fluence, 25 J/cm(2), delivered at an irradiance of 0.5 W/cm(2) substantially increased the bonding strength (\u223c 10-fold) compared to controls in Yorkshire swine skin. Increasing the fluence to 100 J/cm(2) enhanced bonding strength by a further 1.5-fold. Application of 0.1% RB for 2 minutes produced the greatest bonding strength using 100 J/cm(2) and limited the penetration of RB to an \u223c 50 \u03bcm band on the dermal incision wall. Reflectance spectra indicated that Yorkshire skin had minimal melanin and that Yucatan skin was a good model for highly pigmented human skin. In Yucatan skin, the bonding strength increased 1.7-fold using 0.1% RB and 200 J/cm(2) at 1.5 W/cm(2) with cooling and epinephrine. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that absorption of 532 nm light by epidermal melanin in dark skin decreased the power absorbed along the incision in the dermis by a factor of 2.7. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in lightly pigmented skin the PTB treatment time can be shortened without compromising the bonding strength. Sealing incisions using PTB in moderately and highly pigmented skin will require a careful balance of irradiance and cooling."

Hemosiderin and/or melanin have been considered responsible for the brown pigmentation. However, there are not sufficient histopathologic studies. In this retrospective study the hospital records and biopsy slides of 20 patients were reviewed to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms of brown pigmentation in stasis dermatitis. Fifteen were men (75%) and 5 were women (25%) with a mean age of 46.2+/-8.2 yr (18-76), mean age at onset of 43.4+/-18.0 yr (17-73), and a mean duration of the disease 2.8+/-2.5 yr (0.25-10). All patients had varicose vein and complained of pruritus. On histopathologic evaluation, two cases out of 20 (3 skin biopsy specimens from 25 samples) showed dermal melanocytes containing melanin, and incontinence of melanin pigment was observed in 5 cases, which indicates that melanin pigments from epidermis could contribute to cutaneous pigmentation in stasis dermatitis. However, the existence of dermal melanocytes in two cases cannot be explained because normally the dermis contains no melanocytes. Further studies concerning the role of iron or inflammatory cytokines on the development of dermal melanocytes should be conducted."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) can be difficult to treat especially in patients with darker skin types as darker skin carries increased epidermal melanin content. Various treatments available to improve the appearance of PIH may incite further pigmentation thus making treatment extremely difficult and frustrating. The purpose of this study was to perform a retrospective chart and photographic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of a low energy low density non-ablative fractional1927 nm wavelength laser treatment for PIH in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective evaluation of 61 patients with PIH treated with a 1927 nm laser was conducted at a single center. Inclusion criteria required at least 2 treatment sessions so that before and after treatment photographs would be available for comparison and study purposes. Two blinded physician-evaluators using a visual analog scale for percentage of pigmentary clearance in standard photographs assessed treatment efficacy. RESULTS: The mean percent improvement after treatment, evaluated by two dermatologists was 43.24%. The correlation between raters was statistically significant (Pearson's correlation coefficienct of r\u2009=\u20090.59, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). No side effects were observed in the patients treated with the 1927 nm laser. CONCLUSION: The low energy low density non-ablative fractional 1927 nm wavelength laser is a safe and effective modality for improving post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with darker skin types.

                "abstract": "We have previously found that mycelia culture broth of eight kinds of traditional herbal extracts fermented with Phellinus linteus (previously named as 8-HsPLCB) not only inhibited melanin and tyrosinase activity, but also reduced the contents of melanogenesis-related proteins, including tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, in 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-stimulated B16F0 melanoma cells. For a further study, the effect of 8-HsPLCB against skin pigmentation in brown guinea pigs with ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced hyperpigmentation was investigated. 8-HsPLCB (3%) and arbutin (2%) as positive controls were applied topically twice daily for 4 weeks to the hyperpigmented areas. 8-HsPLCB showed skin-lightening effect as effective as arbutin, one of the most widely used in whitening cosmetics. Melanin index values as the degree of pigmentation showed a significant reduction week by week post 8-HsPLCB treatment and then substantially reduced by 4 weeks. The degree of depigmentation after 4 weeks of topical application with 8-HsPLCB was 32.2% as compared with before treatment (0 week). Moreover, using Fontana-Masson staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining, 8-HsPLCB reduced melanin pigmentation in the basal layer of the epidermis and epidermal thickness changes exposed to the UV-B irradiation as compared with non-treatment and vehicle treatment. The intensity of the skin-lightening effect of 8-HsPLCB was similar to arbutin. These results suggest that the skin-lightening effect of 8-HsPLCB might be resulted from inhibition of melanin synthesis by tyrosinase in melanocytes. To conclude, 8-HsPLCB treatment showed reduction of the melanin pigment and histological changes induced by UV irradiation in brown guinea pigs."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laser treatments have been used to treat a variety of scar symptoms, including the appearance of scars following burn injury. One such symptom is hyperpigmentation. There are several qualitative and quantitative measures of assessing improvement in hyperpigmentation over time. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) are two scales that describe characteristics of scar such as pigmentation level. These scales are limited by their qualitative nature. On the other hand, spectrophotometers provide quantitative measures of pigmentation. Prior studies have reported that laser can change scar pigmentation, but no quantitative values have been reported. The current study examines changes in scar melanin index after CO2 fractional ablative laser scar revision (FLSR) via noninvasive probe measurement in patients of various Fitzpatrick skin types (FST). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with scars of various sizes and etiologies were treated with FLSR. A database was constructed including 189 patients undergoing laser treatment. From this pool, individuals were selected based on the criteria that they completed at least two laser sessions and had Melanin index measurements for both of these sessions and the pre-operative visit. This criteria resulted in 63 patients of various FST in the cohort. Melanin index, POSAS-Observer (O) and -Patient (P) pigmentation and color scores and VSS-pigmentation scores were examined over time. Demographic information (age of patient at time of first treatment, age of scar at time of first treatment, use of laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD), gender, FST, and Ethnicity) were collected from the medical record. Patients were grouped as \"responder\" if their Melanin index indicated decreased levels of hyperpigmentation after FLSR treatment in more than half of their total number of visits and \"nonresponder\" if it did not. RESULTS: The majority of patients were responders (41/63). In responder patients, measurements of Melanin index showed significantly improved levels of hyperpigmentation in hypertrophic scars after two FLSR sessions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Age of patient, gender, FST, age of scar, ethnicity, or type of drug delivered by LADD did not predict responder grouping. POSAS-O and -P pigmentation/color scores showed improved scores after two FLSR sessions within the responder group. POSAS-P color scores showed improved scores after two and three FLSR sessions in the nonresponder group. VSS pigmentation scores showed improved scores after three FLSR sessions in the responder group only. CONCLUSION: Based on Melanin index values, FLSR leads to improvements in hyperpigmentation in certain patients."

            "abstract": "Fibrotic animal models are critical for the pathogenesis investigations and drug explorations in systemic sclerosis (SSc). The bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model is the classical and most widely used fibrosis model. However, traditional subcutaneous injection of BLM rarely induced diffuse skin and lung lesions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl)-induced mice are a more representative model that have diffuse cutaneous lesions, lung fibrosis and renal involvement. However, the fibrotic and immunological features of this model are not fully elucidated. Here, we injected BALB/c mice subcutaneously with HOCl used at different concentrations of HOCl (1:55, 1:70, and 1:110 NaClO: KH2PO4, hereafter named HOCl55, HOCl70, and HOCl110, respectively) for 6 weeks to induce fibrosis, and also used HOCl110 at different time course (4, 5, and 6 weeks). Morphological changes were observed via HE and Masson's trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry or real-time PCR was used to detect inflammatory infiltrates, important fibrosis pathways and pro-inflammatory mediator expression. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alteration of immune cells in mouse spleen. Skin and lung fibrosis were most obvious in the HOCl55 group compared to lower concentration groups. In the HOCl110 group, dominant inflammatory infiltrates were found after 5 weeks, and significant fibrosis was found after 6 weeks. Then we explored the fibrosis and immunological profiles in the HOCl110 (6 weeks) group. Important fibrosis pathway proteins such as TGF-\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, Smad3, p-Smad3, STAT3, and p-STAT3 were significantly elevated at week 6 in the HOCl110 group. Increased infiltration of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, CD20+B cells, and myofibroblasts was found both in skin and lung tissues. However, decreased CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, monocytes and macrophages and increased CD19+B cells were found in the spleen tissues. The mRNA expression of fibrosis mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, and CTGF was also upregulated in skin and lung tissues. In conclusion, HOCl induced fibrosis mouse model displayed systemic immune cell infiltration, pro-inflammatory mediator release, vasculopathy and fibrosis, which better mimicked human SSc than BLM-induced mice."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterised by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, such as the lungs. Enhanced Th17 responses are associated with skin fibrosis in patients with SSc, however, whether they are associated with lung fibrosis has not been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the potential association of Th17 responses with the skin and pulmonary fibrosis as well as the potential mechanisms in a mouse bleomycin (BLM) model of SSc. METHODS: BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (control) or BLM for 28 days and the skin and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were characterized by histology. The percentages of circulating, skin and pulmonary infiltrating Th17 cells and the contents of collagen in mice were analysed. The levels of ROR\u03b3t, IL-17A, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21 mRNA transcripts in the skin and lungs were determined by quantitative RTPCR and the levels of serum IL-17A, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21 were determined by ELISA. Furthermore, the effect of rIL-17A on the proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts and their cytokine expression was analysed. The potential association of Th17 responses with the severity of skin and lung fibrosis was analysed. RESULTS: In comparison with the control mice, significantly increased skin and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis and higher levels of hydroxyproline were detected in the BLM mice. Significantly higher frequency of circulating, skin and lung infiltrating Th17 cells and higher levels of serum, skin and lung IL-17A, TGF-\u03b21, IL-6 and ROR\u03b3t were detected in the BLM mice. The concentrations of serum IL-17A were correlated positively with the percentages of Th17 cells and the contents of skin hydroxyproline in the BLM mice. The levels of IL-17A expression were positively correlated with the skin and lung inflammatory scores as well as the skin fibrosis in the BLM mice. In addition, IL-17A significantly enhanced pulmonary fibroblast proliferation and their type I collagen, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression in vitro, which were attenuated by treatment with anti-IL-17A. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Th17 cells participate in the pathogenesis of skin and lung fibrosis by enhancing fibroblast proliferation and cytokine production in a mouse BLM model of SSc."

                "abstract": "Daily subcutaneous (sc) injection of bleomycin (BLM) causes dermal fibrosis but rarely causes lung changes in mice. There are also significant disadvantages to this traditional model for systemic sclerosis, including a variable distribution of lesions and a requirement for repetitive procedures. The present study was undertaken to develop a convenient method of BLM administration that yields stable dermal inflammation and fibrosis with extensive and reproducible interstitial lung disease (ILD) in mice. Osmotic minipumps containing BLM (150\u2009mg/kg) or saline were implanted sc in C57BL/6 mice and the drug was delivered as a continuous infusion over 1\u223c4 weeks. The time course of morphological features, collagen content, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the skin and the lungs were analyzed. Pathological examination demonstrated dominant inflammatory infiltrates at week 1 and significant fibrosis at week 4. Decreased microvessel density and increased myofibroblast counts were observed in the skin of BLM-treated mice at week 4. In addition, there were obvious increases in dermal infiltration of CD45(+) leukocytes, including F4/80(+) macrophages, Gr-1(+) neutrophils, and CD3(+) T lymphocytes in BLM-treated mice. IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, and CXCL2 transcripts were continually upregulated by BLM in the skin and lung tissues. In addition, lungs from BLM-treated mice showed significant inflammatory infiltrates and confluent subpleural fibrosis at week 4. In conclusion, this modified murine model for drug-induced systemic inflammation and fibrosis uses a single procedure and provides reproducible skin and lung lesions, mimicking human systemic sclerosis (SSc) with ILD-like manifestation."

                "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and multi-organ fibrosis. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a complication of SSc and a leading cause of SSc-death. The administration of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) intradermally in the mouse (HOCl-SSc) purportedly shows several features typical of SSc. We studied the model by injecting BALB/c mice daily intradermally with HOCl for 6-weeks, an exposure reported to induce lung fibrosis. On day 42, the skinfold thickness and the dermal thickness were two and three times larger respectively in the HOCl group compared to controls. HOCl treatment did not result in histological features of pulmonary fibrosis nor significant changes in lung compliance. Automated image analysis of HOCl mice lungs stained with picrosirius red did not show increased collagen deposition. HOCl injections did not increase pulmonary mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic genes nor induced the production of serum advanced oxidation protein products and anti-topoisomerase 1 antibodies. Immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and whole lung digests were not increased in HOCl-treated animals. Since lung fibrosis is proposed to be triggered by oxidative stress, we injected HOCl to Nrf2-/- mice, a mouse deficient in many antioxidant proteins. Lung compliance, histology, and BALF leukocyte numbers were comparable between Nrf2-/- mice and wild-type controls. We conclude that the HOCl-SSc model does not manifest SSc-lung disease."

                "abstract": "AIM: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by immune abnormalities, progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and microvascular injury and damage. Interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is expressed in the epidermis from patients with SSc. However, information describing the role of IL-21 in SSc is limited. METHODS: We established a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) IL-21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells in peripheral blood, skin and lungs of BLM-induced mice were detected by flow cytometry; IL-21 levels in the peripheral blood were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD4(+) T cells were isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced and control mice and cultured in vitro alone or in the presence of mrIL-21 or mrIL-21 plus transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21. The frequency of Th17 cells was detected by flow cytometry; levels of IL-17 were evaluated by ELISA, and the expression of IL-17A and retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors gamma t (ROR\u03b3t) messenger RNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Compared to control mice, the frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were significantly increased in BLM-induced mice. The frequency of CD4(+) IL-21(+) T, CD4(+) 21R(+) T and IL-21(+) Th17 cells and the levels of IL-21 were correlated with dermal and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analyses indicate that IL-21 promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells from CD4(+) cells isolated from the spleen of BLM-induced mice. CONCLUSION: IL-21 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSc as a Th17 effector cytokine, and IL-21 may induce the differentiation of Th17 cells in the BLM-induced SSc mouse model."

However, its role in the development of fibrosis in the in vivo model of systemic sclerosis (SSc) has not been reported. This study investigated the effects of miRNA-21a-5p overexpression and inhibition on SSc fibrosis using a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model. METHODS: A murine SSc model was induced by subcutaneously injecting 100\u00a0\u03bcg bleomycin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl into C57BL/6 mice daily for 5\u00a0weeks. On days 14, 21, and 28 from the start of bleomycin injection, 100\u00a0\u03bcg pre-miRNA-21a-5p or anti-miRNA-21a-5p in 1\u00a0mL saline was hydrodynamically injected into the mice. Fibrosis analysis was conducted in lung and skin tissues of SSc mice using hematoxylin and eosin as well as Masson's trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of inflammatory cytokines, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) at Y705 or S727, and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome-10 (PTEN) in skin tissues of SSc mice. RESULTS: MiRNA-21a-5p overexpression promoted lung fibrosis in bleomycin-induced SSc mice, inducing infiltration of cells expressing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or IL-17, along with STAT3 phosphorylated cells in the lesional skin. Conversely, anti-miRNA-21a-5p injection improved fibrosis in the lung and skin tissues of SSc mice, reducing the infiltration of cells secreting inflammatory cytokines in the skin tissue. In particular, it decreased STAT3-phosphorylated cell infiltration at Y705 and increased the infiltration of PTEN-expressing cells in the skin tissue of SSc mice. CONCLUSION: MiRNA-21a-5p promotes fibrosis in an in vivo murine SSc model, suggesting that its inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy for improving fibrosis in SSc."

                "abstract": "The bleomycin-induced scleroderma model is a well-established and dependable method for creating a mouse model of SSc (systemic sclerosis). In the field of skin connective tissue diseases, increasing evidence from clinical and animal experiments suggests that TLRs (Toll-like receptors) play an important role in several diseases. This study aimed to determine the role of TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7) and TLR9 (Toll-like receptor 9) in the mechanisms of immune abnormalities and fibrosis in SSc. This study used TLR7-KO mice (TLR7-knockout mice with a balb/c background) and TLR9-KO mice (TLR9-knockout mice with a balb/c background) as well as WT mice (wild-type balb/c mice). All three kinds of mice were induced by BLM (bleomycin) in a scleroderma model as the experimental group; meanwhile, WT mice treated with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) were used as the control group. We analyzed the fibrotic phenotype and the immunological abnormality phenotype of TLR7-deficient and TLR9-deficient mice in the SSc disease model using flow cytometry, RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), a histological examination, and IHC (immunohistochemical staining). In a mouse model of SSc disease, the deletion of TLR7 attenuated skin and lung fibrosis, while the deletion of TLR9 exacerbated skin and lung fibrosis. The deletion of TLR7 resulted in a relative decrease in the infiltration and expression of various pro-inflammatory and fibrotic cells and cytokines in the skin. On the other hand, the deletion of TLR9 resulted in a relative increase in the infiltration and expression of various pro-inflammatory and cytokine-inhibiting cells and cytokines in the skin. Under the influence of pDCs (plasmacytoid dendritic cells), the balances of Beff/Breg (IL-6 + CD19 + B cell/IL-10 + CD19 + B cell), Th17/Treg (IL-17A + CD4 + T cell/Foxp3 + CD25 + CD4 + T cell), M1/M2 (CD86 + macrophage/CD206 + macrophage), and Th1/Th2 (TNF\u03b1 + CD3 + CD4 + T cell/IL-4 + CD3 + CD4 + T cell) were biased towards the suppression of inflammation and fibrosis as a result of the TLR7 deletion. Comparatively, the balance was biased towards promoting inflammation and fibrosis due to the TLR9 deletion. In the SSc model, TLR7 promoted inflammation and fibrosis progression, while TLR9 played a protective role. These results suggest that TLR7 and TLR9 play opposite roles in triggering SSc to produce immune system abnormalities and skin fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled immune response with T cell activation has a key role in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), a disorder that is characterized by generalized fibrosis affecting particularly the lungs and skin. Costimulatory molecules are key players during immune activation, and recent evidence supports a role of CD28 and ICOS in the development of fibrosis. We herein investigated the efficacy of acazicolcept (ALPN-101), a dual ICOS/CD28 antagonist, in two complementary SSc-related mouse models recapitulating skin fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: Expression of circulating soluble ICOS and skin-expressed ICOS was investigated in SSc patients. Thereafter, acazicolcept was evaluated in the hypochlorous acid (HOCL)-induced dermal fibrosis mouse model and in the Fra-2 transgenic (Tg) mouse model. In each model, mice received 400 \u03bcg of acazicolcept or a molar-matched dose of an Fc control protein twice a week for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, skin and lung were evaluated. RESULTS: ICOS was significantly increased in the sera from SSc patients and in SSc skin biopsies as compared to samples from healthy controls. Similar body weight changes were observed between Fc control and acazicolcept groups in both HOCL and Fra-2 Tg mice suggesting a good tolerance of acazicolcept treatment. In mice challenged with HOCL, acazicolcept induced a significant decrease in dermal thickness, collagen content, myofibroblast number, and inflammatory infiltrates characterized by B cells, T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. In the Fra-2 Tg mouse model, acazicolcept treatment reduced lung collagen content, fibrillar collagen, histological fibrosis score, and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). A reduction in frequency of CD4+ and T effector memory cells and an increase in the percentage of CD4+ T na\u00efve cells in spleen and lung of acazicolcept-treated Fra-2 Tg mice was observed as compared to Fc control-treated Fra-2 Tg mice. Moreover, acazicolcept reduced CD69 and PD-1 expression on CD4+ T cells from the spleen and the lung. Target engagement by acazicolcept was demonstrated by blockade of CD28 and ICOS detection by flow cytometry in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the importance of costimulatory molecules in inflammatory-driven fibrosis. Our data highlight a key role of ICOS and CD28 in SSc. Using complementary models, we demonstrated that dual ICOS/CD28 blockade by acazicolcept decreased dermal and pulmonary fibrosis and alleviated pulmonary hypertension. These results pave the way for subsequent research on ICOS/CD28-targeted therapies."

                "abstract": "Our aim was to evaluate the roles of the cannabinoid pathway in the induction and propagation of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in a mouse model of diffuse SSc induced by hypochlorite injections. BALB/c mice injected subcutaneously every day for 6 weeks with PBS or hypochlorite were treated intraperitoneally with either WIN-55,212, an agonist of the cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and receptors 2 (CB2), with JWH-133, a selective agonist of CB2, or with PBS. Skin and lung fibrosis were then assessed by histological and biochemical methods, and the proliferation of fibroblasts purified from diseased skin was assessed by thymidine incorporation. Autoantibodies were detected by ELISA, and spleen cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Experiments were also performed in mice deficient for CB2 receptors (Cnr2(-/-)). Injections of hypochlorite induced cutaneous and lung fibrosis as well as increased the proliferation rate of fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic skin, splenic B cell counts, and levels of anti-DNA topoisomerase-1 autoantibodies. Treatment with WIN-55,212 or with the selective CB2 agonist JWH-133 prevented the development of skin and lung fibrosis as well as reduced fibroblast proliferation and the development of autoantibodies. Experiments performed in CB2-deficient mice confirmed the influence of CB2 in the development of systemic fibrosis and autoimmunity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the CB2 receptor is a potential target for the treatment of SSc because it controls both skin fibroblast proliferation and the autoimmune reaction."

Recent insights into the polarization of macrophages in scleroderma and into the implication of STAT6 and KLF4 in this process have prompted us to investigate the effects of the inhibition of STAT6 signaling pathway by leflunomide in mice. SSc was induced in BALB/c mice by daily subcutaneous injections of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or bleomycin. Mice were treated (or not) every other day, for 4 or 6 weeks, by leflunomide. Skin and lung fibrosis as well as immunological features were studied. Mice exposed to HOCl developed a diffuse cutaneous SSc with pulmonary fibrosis and anti-DNA topoisomerase 1 auto-antibodies. STAT6 pathway was hyperactivated and KLF4 was overexpressed in the skin and the lungs of diseased mice. Their inhibition by leflunomide prevented skin and lung fibrosis. Moreover, the hyperproliferative and pro-oxidative phenotype of skin and lung fibroblasts was reversed by leflunomide. Beneficial immunological effects of leflunomide were associated with decreased activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cell activation, decreased auto-antibodies production and restored polarization of macrophages in the spleen. The improvement provided by leflunomide in both mouse models of SSc provides a rationale for the evaluation of this immunomodulating drug in the management of patients affected by this disease."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective-tissue disease characterized by vascular injury, immune-system disorders, and excessive fibrosis of the skin and multiple internal organs. Recent reports found that RhoA/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway is implicated in various fibrogenic diseases. Intradermal injection of hypochlorous acid (HOCl)-generating solution induced inflammation, autoimmune activation, and fibrosis, mimicking the cutaneous diffuse form of SSc in humans. Our study aimed firstly to describe pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis induced by HOCl in mice, and secondly to determine whether fasudil, a selective inhibitor of ROCK, could prevent lung and skin fibroses in HOCl-injected mice. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice received daily intradermal injection of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) for 6 weeks to induce SSc, with and without daily treatment with fasudil (30\u00a0mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) by oral gavage. RESULTS: HOCl intoxication induced significant lung inflammation (macrophages and neutrophils infiltration), and fibrosis. These modifications were prevented by fasudil treatment. Simultaneously, HOCl enhanced ROCK activity in lung and skin tissues. Inhibition of ROCK reduced skin fibrosis, expression of \u03b1-smooth-muscle actin and 3-nitrotyrosine, as well as the activity of ROCK in the fibrotic skin of HOCl-treated mice, through inhibition of phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and ERK1/2. Fasudil significantly decreased the serum levels of anti-DNA-topoisomerase-1 antibodies in mice with HOCl-induced SSc. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm HOCl-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice, and provide further evidence for a key role of RhoA/ROCK pathway in several pathological processes of experimental SSc. Fasudil could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of SSc."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immune regulatory and anti-fibrosis function of thalidomide (Thal) in systemic sclerosis (SSc), we investigated the effects of Thal on: (a) Th17 and Treg cell production; (b) related factors expression; and (c) transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21/Smad3 pathway, using a mouse model of SSc. METHODS: Forty female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into a normal control (NC) group, SSc group (bleomycin [BLM]-induced experimental SSc), BLM\u00a0+\u00a0Thal (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) group, BLM\u00a0+\u00a0Thal (20) group, and BLM\u00a0+\u00a0Thal (30) group. Thal was administered a day after BLM. At the end of the animal experiments, mouse tissues were collected for detection of pathological changes and hydroxyproline content. Flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, Western blot and other methods were used to measure Th17, Treg cell population and their related factors, as well as TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 pathway expression. RESULTS: Thal treatment: (a) reduced skin, and pulmonary tissue fibrosis, inflammation score, and hydroxyproline content (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) in BLM-induced SSc mice; (b) reduced the percentages of Th17 cells and associated interleukin (IL)-17A expression (both P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) but increased the percentages of Treg cells and its transcription factor Foxp3 expression (both P\u00a0<\u00a0.05); (c) correlation analysis found positive correlations between Th17/Treg ratio, the inflammatory score of the skin and pulmonary tissues, hydroxyproline content, and type I collagen messenger RNA expression (r\u00a0=\u00a0.8546, .8656, .6902, .6807, .8118, and .8424, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01); (d) Thal inhibited TGF-\u03b21 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation (both P\u00a0<\u00a0.05); (e) TGF-\u03b21 was positively correlated with the IL-17A and Th17/Treg ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a0.5856, P\u00a0=\u00a0.005; r\u00a0=\u00a0.6684, P\u00a0=\u00a0.0107, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thal can effectively prevent skin and pulmonary tissue fibrosis in a mouse model of SSc through the TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signaling pathway and can rectify the distortion of the Th17/Treg balance in SSc by potentially regulating Th17 and Treg cell production, as well as their related factors expression."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent advances suggest that the cellular redox state may play a significant role in the progression of fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Another, and as yet poorly accounted for, feature of SSc is its overlap with thyroid abnormalities. Previous reports demonstrate that hypothyroidism reduces oxidant stress. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of propylthiouracil (PTU), and of the hypothyroidism induced by it, on the development of cutaneous and pulmonary fibrosis in the oxidant stress murine model of SSc. METHODS: Chronic oxidant stress SSc was induced in BALB/c mice by daily subcutaneous injections of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) for 6 weeks. Mice (n = 25) were randomized into three arms: HOCl (n = 10), HOCl plus PTU (n = 10) or vehicle alone (n = 5). PTU administration was initiated 30 minutes after HOCl subcutaneous injection and continued daily for 6 weeks. Skin and lung fibrosis were evaluated by histologic methods. Immunohistochemical staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in cutaneous and pulmonary tissues was performed to evaluate myofibroblast differentiation. Lung and skin concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), rat sarcoma protein (Ras), Ras homolog gene family (Rho), and transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Injections of HOCl induced cutaneous and lung fibrosis in BALB/c mice. PTU treatment prevented both dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. Myofibroblast differentiation was also inhibited by PTU in the skin and lung. The increase in cutaneous and pulmonary expression of VEGF, ERK, Ras, and Rho in mice treated with HOCl was significantly prevented in mice co-administered with PTU. CONCLUSIONS: PTU, probably through its direct effect on reactive oxygen species or indirectly through thyroid function inhibition, prevents the development of cutaneous and pulmonary fibrosis by blocking the activation of the Ras-ERK pathway in the oxidant-stress animal model of SSc."

                "abstract": "Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) is increased as a result of lung inflammation, which in turn causes subsequent interstitial lung disease in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, the exact time course of inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the SSc lung has not yet been described. Our objective was to assess the chronological evolution of lung inflammatory and fibrotic processes in mice pre-treated with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or bleomycin. C57BL/6 mice were randomized into three groups receiving subcutaneous injections of HOCl, bleomycin, or PBS for 2, 4 or 6 weeks. Exhaled NO (eNO) was measured at the end of each injection period and after 2 resting weeks without injection (8 week group). Mice were then sacrificed to obtain skin and lung tissues to measure fibrotic changes and NO synthases (NOS) expression. Increased eNO, inducible NOS and nitrotyrosine expression in bronchial epithelium, lung neutrophils and macrophages were observed at early phases in both HOCl- and bleomycin-treated mice. Conversely, lung vascular endothelial NOS expression decreased significantly at 6th and 8th weeks. Skin fibrosis was significantly increased from the 4th week and lung fibrosis from 6th week. We conclude that lung inflammation occurs early after injury as reflected by increased exhaled NO and inducible NOS expression, and precedes fibrotic changes in skin and lungs of mice pre-treated with bleomycin and HOCl. Early detection and treatment of pulmonary inflammation might be useful in preventing subsequent occurrence of lung fibrosis in SSc patients."

Th17 cells and interleukin-17 (also called IL-17A) have been found to be increased in peripheral blood and skin in patients with SSc. IL-21 is a potent inducer of Th17 differentiation that is produced by activated T cells, and whose relationship with Th17 cells in SSc is unclear. Here, using a bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model of skin fibrosis, we detected the frequency of CD4+/IL-17+ (Th17) cells, CD4+/IL-21+ T cells and IL-21+ Th17 cells in peripheral blood, skin and lungs, as well as the serum content of IL-17A and IL-21. In addition, we assessed the differentiation of CD4+ T cells cultured from these mice into Th17 cells in response to treatment with IL-21. Compared with the control mice, Th17 cell counts and IL-17A levels were significantly increased and correlated with inflammatory and fibrotic indices in the skin and lungs of the BLM-induced fibrosis mice. Moreover, serum levels of CD4+/IL-21+ T cells, IL-21+ Th17 cells, and IL-21 were significantly increased in these mice, and correlated positively with serum levels of Th17 cells. In vitro experiments showed that IL-21 treated CD4+ T cells derived from BLM-induced mice differentiated into Th17 cells. Our results indicate that Th17 cells and IL-17A contributes to inflammatory and fibrotic processes in the skin and lungs in a BLM-induced mouse model of SSc. Moreover, the expansion of the Th17 cell population may be subsequent to IL-21 promotion of the differentiation of CD4+ T cells in these mice. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by vascular injury and inflammation, followed by excessive fibrosis of the skin and other internal organs, including the lungs. CX3CL1 (fractalkine), a chemokine expressed on endothelial cells, supports the migration of macrophages and T cells that express its specific receptor CX3CR1 into targeted tissues. We previously reported that anti-CX3CL1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-induced expression of type I collagen and fibronectin 1 in human dermal fibroblasts. Additionally, anti-mouse CX3CL1 mAb efficiently suppressed skin inflammation and fibrosis in bleomycin- and growth factor-induced SSc mouse models. However, further studies using different mouse models of the complex immunopathology of SSc are required before the initiation of a clinical trial of CX3CL1 inhibitors for human SSc. METHODS: To assess the preclinical utility and functional mechanism of anti-CX3CL1 mAb therapy in skin and lung fibrosis, a sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease (Scl-cGVHD) mouse model was analyzed with immunohistochemical staining for characteristic infiltrating cells and RNA sequencing assays. RESULTS: On day 42 after bone marrow transplantation, Scl-cGVHD mice showed increased serum CX3CL1 level. Intraperitoneal administration of anti-CX3CL1 mAb inhibited the development of fibrosis in the skin and lungs of Scl-cGVHD model, and did not result in any apparent adverse events. The therapeutic effects were correlated with the number of tissue-infiltrating inflammatory cells and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts. RNA sequencing analysis of the fibrotic skin demonstrated that cGVHD-dependent induction of gene sets associated with macrophage-related inflammation and fibrosis was significantly downregulated by mAb treatment. In the process of fibrosis, mAb treatment reduced cGVHD-induced infiltration of macrophages and T cells in the skin and lungs, especially those expressing CX3CR1. CONCLUSIONS: Together with our previous findings in other SSc mouse models, the current results indicated that anti-CX3CL1 mAb therapy could be a rational therapeutic approach for fibrotic disorders, such as human SSc and Scl-cGVHD."

We characterized serological, functional, and histopathological features of the skin and lung in a novel SSc murine model induced by Col V immunization. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice (n\u2009=\u200919, IMU-COLV) were subcutaneously immunized with two doses of Col V (125\u2009\u03bcg) emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant, followed by two intramuscular boosters.

The skin and lung inflammatory processes and the collagen gene/protein expressions were analyzed. RESULTS: Vascular manifestations were characterized by endothelial cell activity and apoptosis, as shown by the increased expression of VEGF, endothelin-1, and caspase-3 in endothelial cells. The IMU-COLV mice presented with increased tissue elastance and a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) histologic pattern in the lung, combined with the thickening of the small and medium intrapulmonary arteries, increased Col V fibers, and increased COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL5A2 gene expression. The skin of the IMU-COLV mice showed thickness, epidermal rectification, decreased papillary dermis, atrophied appendages, and increased collagen, COL5A1, and COL5A2 gene expression. Anti-collagen III and IV and ANA antibodies were detected in the sera of the IMU-COLV mice. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that cutaneous, vascular, and pulmonary remodeling are mimicked in the Col V-induced SSc mouse model, which thus represents a suitable preclinical model to study the mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for SSc."

BLM was injected into the shaved backs of C3H or BALB/c mice (100 microg/mouse) 5 days per week for 3 weeks. Skin fibrosis was confirmed and pathological changes were seen in the lower part of the esophagus and stomach similar to those seen in SSc. The sera from these mice had autoantibodies specific to the damaged tissues and ANAs. Transfer of CD4(+) T cells from BLM-treated BALB/c mice induced the same pathological changes and antibody production in untreated-BALB/c nude mice. Hence, tissue fibrosis and the production of ANAs are probably associated with CD4(+) T-cell activity in this model. In conclusion, this model will be valuable for investigating the relationship between tissue fibrosis and abnormalities of the immune system."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) have been considered to play central roles in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), other cytokines may also be crucial for the development of SSc. The aim of this study was to examine the roles of T helper cytokines in the development of skin fibrosis. METHODS: To compare the roles of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines, we examined bleomycin-induced SSc in mice deficient for interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and IL-17A. The mechanism by which IL-17A contributes to bleomycin-induced fibrosis was investigated in vivo and in vitro. The outcome of mice lacking IL-17A was also investigated in TSK-1 mice. RESULTS: The loss of IL-17A significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis, whereas a deficiency of IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 did not. Leukocyte infiltration and the expression of TGF\u03b2 and CTGF messenger RNA in bleomycin-injected skin were significantly reduced in IL-17A-deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Daily bleomycin injections induced the expression of IL-17A in the skin and potent IL-17A producers in splenic CD4+ T cells from WT mice. Furthermore, a skin fibroblast cell line expressed increased TGF\u03b2, CTGF, and collagen after the addition of recombinant IL-17A. IL-17A deficiency also attenuated skin thickness in TSK-1 mice. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-17A contributes to skin fibrosis in 2 mouse models of SSc. These findings suggest that inhibition of IL-17A represents a therapeutic target for antagonizing fibrotic skin disorders such as SSc."

            "abstract": "Hyperglycemia induces chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), which is a newly identified contributor to diabetes-related tissue lesions, including the inflammatory bone loss in periodontitis. It is also a secondary senescent pattern mediated by an increased burden of senescent cells and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Macrophage is a key SASP-spreading cell and may contribute to the maintenance of SASP response in the periodontal microenvironment. Using a transgenic diabetic model (BLKS/J-Leprdb/leprdb mice) we identified striking senescence of the periodontium in young (18-wk)-diabetic mice accompanied by amassed p16+-macrophages and enhanced early SASP response. Exposed to high glucose in vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) revealed a strong GLUT1 mRNA response driving the elevated-glucose uptake. GLUT1 is a representative and facilitative glucose transporter in macrophages with potential roles in hyperglycemia-induced inflammation. In this study, both GLUT1 and the downstream GTPase Rheb expression upregulated in the gingiva of diabetic mice with impaired condition. Furthermore, SASP release and p16/p21 signaling were proven to be triggered by mTOR phosphorylation in BMDM and antagonized by restricting glucose uptake in GLUT1-/- BMDM. Taken together, our findings suggest that elevated-GLUT1 sensor responded to high glucose is important for macrophage senescence and SASP response, generated as a result of hyperglycemia, and it is a potential molecular mechanism for the exacerbation of periodontitis in diabetes."

                "abstract": "Inflamm-aging was recently affiliated with the progression of diabetic complications. Local cellular senescence together with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) are the main contributors to inflamm-aging. However, little is known about their involvement in diabetic periodontitis. Gingiva is the first line of host defense in the periodontium, and macrophages are key SASP-carrying cells. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism by which hyperglycemia drives the inflamm-aging in the gingival tissue of diabetic mice and macrophages. We demonstrated that hyperglycemia increased the infiltrated macrophage senescence in gingival tissue of diabetic mice. Simultaneously, hyperglycemia elevated the local burden of senescent cells in gingival tissue and induced the serum secretion of SASP factors in vivo Moreover, in vitro, high glucose induced macrophage senescence and SASP factors secretion through phosphorylation of NLRC4, which further stimulated the NF-\u03baB/Caspase-1 cascade via an IRF8-dependent pathway. Deletion of NLRC4 or IRF8 abolished hyperglycemia-induced cellular senescence and SASP in macrophages. In addition, we found that treatment with metformin inhibited NLRC4 phosphorylation and remarkably decreased cellular senescence and SASP in the context of hyperglycemia. Our data demonstrated that hyperglycemia induces the development of inflamm-aging in gingival tissue and suggested that NLRC4 is a potential target for treatment of diabetes-associated complications."

                "abstract": "Diabetic status is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation and an increased burden of senescent cells. Recently, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been suggested as a possible source of inflammatory factors in obesity-induced type 2 diabetes. However, while senescence is a known consequence of hyperglycaemia, evidences of SASP as a result of the glycaemic insult are missing. In addition, few data are available regarding which cell types are the main SASP-spreading cells in vivo. Adopting a four-pronged approach we demonstrated that: i) an archetypal SASP response that was at least partly attributable to endothelial cells and macrophages is induced in mouse kidney after in vivo exposure to sustained hyperglycaemia; ii) reproducing a similar condition in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages, hyperglycaemic stimulus largely phenocopies the SASP acquired during replicative senescence; iii) in endothelial cells, hyperglycaemia-induced senescence and SASP could be prevented by SOD-1 overexpression; and iiii) ex vivo circulating angiogenic cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from diabetic patients displayed features consistent with the SASP. Overall, the present findings document a direct link between hyperglycaemia and the SASP in endothelial cells and macrophages, making the SASP a highly likely contributor to the fuelling of low-grade inflammation in diabetes."

                "abstract": "Diabetes is emerging as a severe global health problem that threatens health and increases socioeconomic burden. Periodontal impairment is one of its well-recognized complications. The destruction of the periodontal defense barrier makes it easier for periodontal pathogens to invade in, triggering a greater inflammatory response, and causing secondary impairment. Macrophages are the major immune cells in periodontium, forming the frontier line of local innate immune barrier. Here, we explored the periodontal impairments and functional changes of macrophages under the diabetic and aging conditions. Besides, we further explored the molecular mechanism of how hyperglycemia and aging contribute to this pathogenesis. To test this, we used young and aged mice to build diabetic mice, and metformin treatment was applied to a group of them. We demonstrated that under hyperglycemia conditions, macrophage functions, such as inflammatory cytokines secretion, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and immune response, were disturbed. Simultaneously, this condition elevated the local senescent cell burden and induced secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Meanwhile, we found that expressions of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) and caspase-1 were up-regulated in diabetic conditions, suggesting that the local senescent burden and systemic proinflammatory state during diabetes were accompanied by the initiation of pyroptosis. Furthermore, we found that the changes in aged condition were similar to those in diabetes, suggesting a hyperglycemia-induced pre-aging state. In addition, we show that metformin treatment alleviated and remarkably reversed these functional abnormalities. Our data demonstrated that diabetes initiated macrophage pyroptosis, which further triggered macrophage function impairments and gingival destructions. This pathogenesis could be reversed by metformin."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a known age-related disease. Inflammaging has recently been shown to result in diabetic complications. Vitamin D3 is related to aging in the latest study but little is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we investigated the effects of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) on inflammaging in diabetic periodontitis, a common chronic inflammatory diabetic complication. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A model of Porphyromonas gingivalis-infected db/db mice as experimental type 2 diabetic periodontitis was adopted in the whole study. A range of techniques, including microCT, western blotting, ELISA, histological and immunohistochemical analysis, were carried out in this study. The distinctive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in serum was measured by Luminex technology. RESULTS: We found an archetypal inflammaging status occurred in db/db mice. An increased SASP, senescent enhancement, and periodontal destruction were observed in periodontitis-db/db mice. Upon administration with 25(OH)D3, periodontitis-db/db mice presented increased levels of serum 25(OH)D3, 1\u03b1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 and calcium. Moreover, decreased p16/p21-positive cells, relieved periodontal conditions and ameliorated serum SASP secretion were found in the periodontitis-db/db mice after treatment. Gingival tissue exhibited increased level of VDR and decreased expression of SOCS3, p-STAT3/STAT3, p-STAT5/STAT5, NF-\u03baB and IL-1\u03b2, which were consistent with the change of p16/p21 expression. CONCLUSION: Diabetic periodontitis appeared to develop an inflammaging status resulted in periodontal infection. 25(OH)D3 could inhibit SASP secretion through reducing SOCS3 expression in experimental diabetic periodontitis, dependently inactivating NF-\u03baB pro-inflammatory signaling. The reversible effect further documented that the inflammaging might be a highly likely contributor in diabetic periodontitis."

                "abstract": "The influence of chronic diseases on various facets of macrophage cellular senescence is poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of chronic hyperglycemia on the induction of cellular senescence and subsequent immunosurveillance functions in RAW264.7 macrophages. Macrophages were cultured under normal glucose (NG; 5\u00a0mM), high glucose (HG; 20\u00a0mM), and very high glucose (VHG; 40\u00a0mM) conditions and assessed for markers of cellular senescence. Hyperglycemia induced strong upregulation of SA-\u03b2-gal activity, and loss of\u00a0PCNA\u00a0and\u00a0Lamin B1\u00a0gene expression while markers of cell cycle arrest generally decreased. Non-significant changes in SASP-related proteins\u00a0were observed while ROS levels slightly decreased and mitochondrial membrane potential increased. Protein concentration on the exosome membrane surface and their stability appeared to increase under hyperglycemic conditions. However, when macrophages were exposed to the secretory media (SM) of senescent preadipocytes, a dramatic\u00a0increase in the levels of all inflammatory proteins was recorded especially in the VHG group that was also accompanied by upregulation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 gene expression. SM treatment to hyperglycemic macrophages activated the\u00a0TLR-2/Myd88\u00a0pathway but decreased the expression of scavenger receptors\u00a0RAGE, CD36, and\u00a0Olr-1\u00a0while\u00a0CD44\u00a0and\u00a0CXCL16\u00a0expression increased. On exposure to LPS, a strong upregulation in NO, ROS, and inflammatory cytokines was observed. Together, these results suggest that primary markers of cellular senescence are aberrantly expressed under chronic hyperglycemic conditions in macrophages with no significant SASP activation. Nonetheless, hyperglycemia strongly deregulates macrophage functions leading to impaired immunosurveillance of senescent cells and aggravation of inflamm-aging. This work provides novel insights into how\u00a0hyperglycemia-induced dysfunctions can impact the potency of macrophages to manage senescent cell burden in aging tissues."

                "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic age-related disease that was recently found as a secondary aging pattern regulated by the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The purpose of this study is to detect the potential efficacy and the specific mechanisms of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) healing of age-related inflammation (known as inflammaging) in diabetic periodontitis. Diabetic periodontitis (DP) mice were established by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (STZ) injection and oral P. gingivalis inoculation. Low-level laser irradiation (810\u00a0nm, 0.1\u00a0W, 398\u00a0mW/cm2, 4\u00a0J/cm2, 10\u00a0s) was applied locally around the periodontal lesions every 3\u00a0days for 2 consecutive weeks. Micro-CT and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain was analyzed for periodontal soft tissue and alveolar bone. Western blots, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the protein expression changes on SASP and GLUT1/mTOR pathway. The expression of aging-related factors and SASP including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were reduced in periodontal tissue of diabetic mice. The inhibitory effect of LLLT on GLUT1/mTOR pathway was observed by detecting the related factors mTOR, p-mTOR, GLUT1, and PKM2. COX, an intracytoplasmic photoreceptor, is a key component of the anti-inflammatory effects of LLLT. After LLLT treatment a significant increase in COX was observed in macrophages in the periodontal lesion. Our findings suggest that LLLT may regulate chronic low-grade inflammation by modulating the GLUT1/mTOR senescence-related pathway, thereby offering a potential treatment for diabetic periodontal diseases."

Recently, inflammasomes are thought to contribute to inflammaging. Here, utilizing diabetic models in vivo and in vitro, we investigated the potential association between hyperglycemia-induced inflammaging and gingival tissue dysfunction and the mechanism underlying inflammasome-associated inflammaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gingival epithelium and serum were collected from control and diabetic patients and mice. The expression of p16, p21, and inflammasomes in the gingival epithelium, SASP factors in serum, and the molecular factors associated with gingival epithelial barrier function were assessed. Human oral keratinocyte (HOK) was stimulated with normal and high glucose, and pre-treated with Z-YVAD-FMK (Caspase-1 inhibitor) prior to evaluating cellular senescence, SASP secretion, and inflammasome activation. RESULTS: In vivo, hyperglycemia significantly elevated the local burden of senescent cells in the gingival epithelium and SASP factors in the serum and simultaneously reduced the expression levels of Claudin-1, E-cadherin, and Connexin 43 in the gingival epithelium. Interestingly, the inflammasomes were activated in the gingival epithelium. In vitro, high glucose-induced the inflammaging in HOK, and blocking inflammasome activation through inhibiting Caspase-1 and glucose-induced inflammaging. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia accelerated inflammaging in the gingival epithelium through inflammasomes activation, which is potentially affiliated with a decline in the gingival epithelial barrier function in diabetes. Inflammasomes-related inflammaging may be the crucial mechanism underlying diabetic periodontitis and represents significant opportunities for advancing prevention and treatment options."

                "abstract": "Background/purpose: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontal disease are both prevalent and chronic inflammatory disorders that have significant health impact. Many studies have pointed out that advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in DM induces inflammaging, which is a pre-aging and hyperinflammatory condition, and it has been linked to a greater likelihood in developing periodontitis. Inflammaging in DM has been shown to be driven by AGEs-induced cell senescence, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress, resulting in the degradation of periodontium. Quercetin has shown abilities to decrease inflammation and oxidative stress in a variety of tissues, however, the effect in diabetic periodontitis remains uncertain. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate its impacts on inflammaging in diabetic periodontitis. Materials and methods: We examined cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), wound healing, IL-6 and IL-8 secretions, cellular senescence expression, and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to AGE stimulation with and without Quercetin intervention. Following that, we looked into NF-\u03ba\u03b2 activity to see if Quercetin mediate its effects via this pro-inflammatory signaling. Results: Quercetin at 20\u202f\u03bcM and below did not have any impact on HGFs' cell proliferation rate. Quercetin intervention improved the AGEs-impaired wound healing, in addition to the attenuation of AGEs-induced ROS in a dose-dependent pattern. Moreover, Quercetin therapy dose-dependently inhibited AGEs-induced cell senescence activity along with its senescence associated secretion phenotype (SASP) secretions such as IL-6 and IL-8. Western blot analysis indicated that Quercetin was able to reverse the phosphorylation of p65 and I\u03ba\u03b2 in AGEs-stimulated HGFs, demonstrating it can modulate NF-\u03ba\u03b2 pathway. Conclusion: Accumulation of AGEs can elicit inflammaging in HGFs, as seen by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell senescence expression and oxidative stress. The results proposed that Quercetin is able to ameliorate inflammaging in diabetic periodontitis and improve wound healing via the suppression of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 pathway and hence, may be a promising approach for treatment of diabetes-associated periodontitis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis in diabetic patients is characterized by enhanced inflammation and aggravated tissue damage in comparison with that in non-diabetic counterparts. The progression of periodontal damage under diabetic condition can be partly ascribed to hyperglycemia-induced disturbance between immune activation and inflammation resolution, where macrophages are capable of participating given their plasticity in response to different stimuli. Herein, we aimed to investigate the changes of macrophage polarization in periodontitis under diabetic condition and the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Type-1 diabetes was induced by the injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60\u00a0mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats in N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)-treated groups received NAC dissolved in drinking water (200\u00a0mg/kg/day). Experimental periodontitis was induced by ligating 3-0 silk around left maxillary second molars for 4\u00a0weeks. Alveolar bone destruction was tested by micro-computed tomography and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. M1/M2 macrophage polarization in periodontal tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. RAW264.7 were cultured in normal glucose (5.5\u00a0mM) or high glucose environment (25\u00a0mM) with or without NAC (8\u00a0mmol/L). LPS (100\u00a0ng/ml) and IL-4 (20\u00a0ng/ml) were used to induce M1\u00a0macrophages and M2 macrophages, respectively. M1/M2 macrophage polarization was detected by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining, and flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was detected by fluorogenic probes. RANKL (100\u00a0ng/ml) were applied to induce osteoclastogenic differentiation of RAW264.7, and osteoclast formation was examined by TRAP staining. RESULTS: Rats with diabetes displayed enhanced macrophages infiltration and M1 macrophage polarization in periodontal lesions compared with vehicle-treated rats. Under LPS or IL-4 stimulation, high glucose culture of RAW264.7 elevated ROS level and increased the expression of M1 macrophage markers (iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) whereas decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers (Arg-1 and CD206). Supernatants of high glucose-treated M1/M2 macrophages enhanced osteoclast formation compared to normal glucose-cultured cells. Decreasing ROS level via NAC partially reversed the effect of high glucose on M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Meanwhile, daily intake of NAC in rodent models inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, which subsequently ameliorated alveolar bone loss and decreased osteoclast numbers in periodontitis in diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that hyperglycemia could polarize macrophage toward M1 macrophages via overproducing ROS under inflammatory condition, which might take responsibility for aggravated periodontal damage in periodontitis under diabetic condition. Inhibiting M1 macrophages and restoring M2 macrophages by ROS scavenger is hopefully a potential adjunct treatment strategy for diabetic periodontitis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coinciding with other chronic comorbidities, the prevalence of periodontal disease increases with aging. Mounting evidence has established that senescent cells accumulate at sites of age-related pathologies, where they promote \"non-microbial\" inflammation. We hypothesized that alveolar bone osteocytes develop senescence characteristics in old age. METHODS: Alveolar bone samples were obtained from young (6 months) and old (20 to 22 months) mice to evaluate the expression of senescence biomarkers by immunofluorescent staining. Osteocyte-enriched fractions were used to characterize the age-related senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene expression profile. Primary alveolar bone cells were exposed to the SASP via in vitro senescent conditioned media (SCM) administration. A multiplex assay confirmed protein levels of specific cytokines. Interactions with bacterial components were evaluated by stimulating cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). RESULTS: Increased senescence-associated distension of satellites (SADS) and p16Ink4a mRNA expression were identified in alveolar bone osteocytes with aging. These findings were associated with increased levels of DNA damage, and activated p38 MAPK, both inducers of senescence. Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL6), IL17, IGFBP4, and MMP13 were significantly upregulated with aging in osteocyte-enriched samples. Interestingly, SCM potentiated the LPS-induced expression of IL1\u03b1,\u00a0IL1\u03b2,\u00a0and IL6. Cell migration and differentiation were also impeded by SCM. These in vitro effects were ameliorated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190. CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of senescent osteocytes contributes to deterioration of the periodontal environment by exacerbating chronic inflammation and reducing regeneration in old age. Cellular senescence is a cell-intrinsic response to DNA damage, and a host-related mechanism associated with aging that could potentiate inflammation induced by bacterial components."

                "abstract": "Glucose is a critical component in the proinflammatory response of macrophages (M\u03a6s). However, the contribution of glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the mechanisms regulating subsequent glucose metabolism in the inflammatory response are not well understood. Because M\u03a6s contribute to obesity-induced inflammation, it is important to understand how substrate metabolism may alter inflammatory function. We report that GLUT1 (SLC2A1) is the primary rate-limiting glucose transporter on proinflammatory-polarized M\u03a6s. Furthermore, in high fat diet-fed rodents, M\u03a6s in crown-like structures and inflammatory loci in adipose and liver, respectively, stain positively for GLUT1. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming via increased glucose availability could modulate the M\u03a6 inflammatory response. To increase glucose uptake, we stably overexpressed the GLUT1 transporter in RAW264.7 M\u03a6s (GLUT1-OE M\u03a6s). Cellular bioenergetics analysis, metabolomics, and radiotracer studies demonstrated that GLUT1 overexpression resulted in elevated glucose uptake and metabolism, increased pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, with a complimentary reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rates. Gene expression and proteome profiling analysis revealed that GLUT1-OE M\u03a6s demonstrated a hyperinflammatory state characterized by elevated secretion of inflammatory mediators and that this effect could be blunted by pharmacologic inhibition of glycolysis. Finally, reactive oxygen species production and evidence of oxidative stress were significantly enhanced in GLUT1-OE M\u03a6s; antioxidant treatment blunted the expression of inflammatory mediators such as PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), suggesting that glucose-mediated oxidative stress was driving the proinflammatory response. Our results indicate that increased utilization of glucose induced a ROS-driven proinflammatory phenotype in M\u03a6s, which may play an integral role in the promotion of obesity-associated insulin resistance.

                "abstract": "Cellular senescence and its senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) are widely regarded as promising therapeutic targets for aging-related diseases, such as osteoporosis. However, the expression pattern of cellular senescence and multiple SASP secretion remains unclear, thus leaving a large gap in the knowledge for a desirable intervention targeting cellular senescence. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanism of SASP secretion in the bone microenvironment that can ameliorate aging-related degenerative pathologies including osteoporosis. In this study, osteocyte-like cells (MLO-Y4) were induced to cellular senescence by 2 Gy \u03b3-rays; then, senescence phenotype changes and adverse effects of SASP on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) differentiation potential were investigated. The results revealed that 2 Gy irradiation could hinder cell viability, shorten cell dendrites, and induce cellular senescence, as evidenced by the higher expression of senescence markers p16 and p21 and the elevated formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which was accompanied by the enhanced secretion of SASP markers such as IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, MMP-3, IGFBP-6, resistin, and adiponectin. When 0.8 \u03bcM JAK1 inhibitors were added to block SASP secretion, the higher expression of SASP was blunted, but the inhibition in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs co-cultured with irradiated MLO-Y4 cell conditioned medium (CM- 2 Gy) was alleviated. These results suggest that senescent osteocytes can perturb BMSCs' differential potential via the paracrine signaling of SASP, which was also demonstrated by in vivo experiments. In conclusion, we identified the SASP factor partially responsible for the degenerative differentiation of BMSCs, which allowed us to hypothesize that senescent osteocytes and their SASPs may contribute to radiation-induced bone loss."

                "abstract": "Macrophages (M\u03a6s) are heterogeneous and metabolically flexible, with metabolism strongly affecting immune activation. A classic response to proinflammatory activation is increased flux through glycolysis with a downregulation of oxidative metabolism, whereas alternative activation is primarily oxidative, which begs the question of whether targeting glucose metabolism is a viable approach to control M\u03a6 activation. We created a murine model of myeloid-specific glucose transporter GLUT1 (Slc2a1) deletion. Bone marrow-derived M\u03a6s (BMDM) from Slc2a1M-/- mice failed to uptake glucose and demonstrated reduced glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway activity. Activated BMDMs displayed elevated metabolism of oleate and glutamine, yet maximal respiratory capacity was blunted in M\u03a6 lacking GLUT1, demonstrating an incomplete metabolic reprogramming. Slc2a1M-/- BMDMs displayed a mixed inflammatory phenotype with reductions of the classically activated pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, yet less oxidative stress. Slc2a1M-/- BMDMs had reduced proinflammatory metabolites, whereas metabolites indicative of alternative activation-such as ornithine and polyamines-were greatly elevated in the absence of GLUT1. Adipose tissue M\u03a6s of lean Slc2a1M-/- mice had increased alternative M2-like activation marker mannose receptor CD206, yet lack of GLUT1 was not a critical mediator in the development of obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation. However, Ldlr-/- mice lacking myeloid GLUT1 developed unstable atherosclerotic lesions. Defective phagocytic capacity in Slc2a1M-/- BMDMs may have contributed to unstable atheroma formation. Together, our findings suggest that although lack of GLUT1 blunted glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, M\u03a6 were metabolically flexible enough that inflammatory cytokine release was not dramatically regulated, yet phagocytic defects hindered M\u03a6 function in chronic diseases."

                "abstract": "Overproduction of pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines in the aged, which is called inflammaging, leads to the deterioration of periodontitis. Toll\u2011like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a role in the regulation of cellular senescence, and its expression increases with age. However, there has been limited research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of periodontal inflammaging, and the interplay between TLR4 and inflammaging. In the present study, wild\u2011type and TLR4 gene knockout mice were used to investigate the activation of the TLR4 pathway in mouse periodontitis and the expression of the nucleotide\u2011binding and oligomerization domain\u2011like receptor\u00a03 (NLRP3) inflammasome, an upstream immune checkpoint during the development of inflammaging. Activation of TLR4 in a mouse model of periodontitis enhanced the expression of a senescence\u2011associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which boosted the inflammaging process. Conversely, TLR4 activation downregulated the expression of B\u00a0cell\u2011specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi\u20111) and promoted the priming of NLRP3 inflammasome, both of which are regulators of SASP. Treating gingival fibroblasts with Bmi\u20111 inhibitor PTC209, it was demonstrated that TLR4 activated the NLRP3 pathway and the inflammaging process by suppressing Bmi\u20111. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the expression of Bmi\u20111 expression in the gingiva of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy controls. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TLR4 acted by inhibiting Bmi\u20111 to enhance the NLRP3 pathway and SASP factors. This cascade of reactions may contribute to the senescence of the periodontium."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world with a poor prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer, accounting for 80-90% of cases. The initiation and progression of HCC are closely associated with chronic liver inflammation. In addition, HCC is often accompanied by cell senescence. Senescent hepatocytes can secrete various inflammatory factors, collectively called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP has been confirmed to promote the occurrence of liver cancer by affecting the inflammatory microenvironment. However, its role and the underlying mechanism of hepatic SASP in hepatocarcinogenesis are not clearly understood. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of the effect of the hepatic SASP on the occurrence of HCC is still needed. METHODS: The study aims to explore the role of SASP factors and the underlying mechanism in tumorigenesis and the progression of HCC in vivo. We used diethylnitrosamine (DEN) combined with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (DEN-CCl4) to establish liver cancer model in wild-type (WT) mice and Bcl3 knockout (Bcl3-/-) mice. \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) staining was performed to evaluate the degree of cellular senescence. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the degree of cellular senescence and the activation of macrophage. PCR chip and clinical tissue chip assays were used to estimate the RNA levels of SASP factors and NF-\u03baB related genes, and their protein levels were examined by Western blot assays. RESULTS: DEN-CCl4 induced cellular senescence in mouse hepatocytes. In addition, senescent hepatocytes might release a variety of inflammatory factors that further activate macrophages, thereby changing the microenvironmental state and promoting the occurrence of HCC. Mechanistically, the NF-\u03baB pathway is important because it regulates the SASP. Therefore, we used a PCR chip to detect the expression of NF-\u03baB-related genes in senescent liver tissue. Our results showed that the expression of Bcl3 was increased in senescent hepatocytes, and knocking out Bcl3 significantly inhibited the secretion of hepatocyte SASP factors and the activation of macrophages, thereby inhibiting hepatocarcinogenesis. Finally, in clinical tissues adjacent to HCC tissues in patients, the expression of Bcl3 and IL-8 correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. CONCLUSION: The hepatic SASP can further induce the activation of macrophages during hepatocarcinogenesis, thereby promoting the occurrence of HCC, and that this process is closely related to the expression of Bcl3 in hepatocytes."

During aging, macrophages can adopt a senescent-like phenotype and an altered function, which promotes senescent cell accumulation. In the context of aging and ARD, controlling the resolution of the inflammatory response and preventing chronic inflammation, especially by targeting macrophages, must be a priority. Aging being a dynamic process, we developed a model of in vitro murine peritoneal macrophage aging. Our results show that macrophages cultured for 7 or 14 days exhibit a senescence-like phenotype: proliferation decrease, the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4A and p21CIP1 and of pro-inflammatory SASP components (MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and MMP-9) increase, phagocytosis capacity decline and glycolytic activity is induced. In our model, chronic treatment with CB3, a thioredoxin-1 mimetic anti-inflammatory peptide, completely prevents p21CIP1 increase and enables day 14 macrophages to maintain proliferative activity.We describe a new model of macrophage aging with a senescence-like phenotype associated with inflammatory, metabolic and functional perturbations. This model is a valuable tool for characterizing macrophage aging mechanisms and developing innovative strategies with promising therapeutical purpose in limiting inflammaging and ARD."

Previous results have shown that senescent cells, such as fibroblast and type II airway epithelial cell, are strongly implicated in pathology of RIPF. However, the role of senescent macrophages in the development RIPF is still unknown. In this study, we report that ionizing radiation (IR) increase cellular senescence with higher expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) and senescence-specific genes (p16, p21, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl) in irradiated bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMMs).

In addition, the percentages of SA-\u03b2-Gal+ senescent macrophages are significantly increased in the macrophages of murine irradiated lung tissue. Moreover, robustly elevated expression of p16, SASP chemokines (Ccl2, Cxcl10, and Ccl17) and SASP matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp2, Mmp9, and Mmp12) is observed in the macrophages of irradiated lung, which might stimulate a fibrotic phenotype in pulmonary fibroblasts. In summary, irradiation can induce macrophage senescence, and increase the secretion of SASP in senescent macrophages. Our findings provide important evidence that senescent macrophages might be the target for prevention and treatment of RIPF."

The inflammation microenvironment affects many cellular physiological processes, one of which may be cellular senescence according to previous studies. Senescent cells cannot function normally and secrete inflammatory cytokines and degradative proteins, which are referred to as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, inducing further senescence and inflammation. Thus, stopping this vicious cycle may be helpful for postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment. Here, we used ovariectomized (OVX) mice as an estrogen-deficient model and confirmed that OVX bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) displayed a senescent phenotype and upregulated SASP factor secretion both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, JAK2/STAT3, an important cytokine secretion-related signalling pathway that is associated with SASP secretion, was activated. Estrogen addition and estrogen receptor blockade confirmed that the JAK2/STAT3 axis participated in OVX BMSC senescence by mediating SASP factors. And JAK inhibition reduced SASP factor expression, alleviated senescence and enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Intraperitoneal injection of a JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, prevented bone loss in OVX mice. Collectively, our results revealed that JAK2/STAT3 plays an important role in the inflammation-senescence-SASP feedback loop in OVX BMSCs and that JAK inhibition could be a new method for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis."

                "abstract": "The direct cause of periodontitis is periodontopathic bacteria, while various environmental factors affect the severity of periodontitis. Previous epidemiological studies have shown positive correlations between aging and periodontitis. However, whether and how aging is linked to periodontal health and disease in biological processes is poorly understood. Aging induces pathological alterations in organs, which promotes systemic senescence associated with age-related disease. Recently, it has become evident that senescence at the cellular level, cellular senescence, is a cause of chronic diseases through production of various secretory factors including proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which is referred to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In this study, we examined the pathological roles of cellular senescence in periodontitis. We found localization of senescent cells in periodontal tissue, particularly the periodontal ligament (PDL), in aged mice. Senescent human PDL (HPDL) cells showed irreversible cell cycle arrest and SASP-like phenotypes in vitro. Additionally, we observed age-dependent upregulation of microRNA (miR)-34a in HPDL cells. These results suggest that chronic periodontitis is mediated by senescent PDL cells that exacerbate inflammation and destruction of periodontal tissues through production of SASP proteins. Thus, miR-34a and senescent PDL cells might be promising therapeutic targets for periodontitis in elderly people."

Emerging evidence implicates long noncoding RNAs in inflammation, but their role in macrophage dysfunction associated with inflammatory diabetic complications is unclear and was therefore investigated in this study. Approach and Results- RNA-sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that a long noncoding RNA Dnm3os (dynamin 3 opposite strand) is upregulated in bone marrow-derived macrophages from type 2 diabetic db/db mice, diet-induced insulin-resistant mice, and diabetic ApoE-/- mice, as well as in monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients relative to controls. Diabetic conditions (high glucose and palmitic acid) induced Dnm3os in mouse and human macrophages. Promoter reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that diabetic conditions induce Dnm3os via NF-\u03baB activation. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCRs of subcellular fractions demonstrated nuclear localization and chromatin enrichment of Dnm3os in macrophages. Stable overexpression of Dnm3os in macrophages altered global histone modifications and upregulated inflammation and immune response genes and phagocytosis. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dnm3os attenuated these responses. RNA pull-down assays with macrophage nuclear lysates identified nucleolin and ILF-2 (interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2) as protein binding partners of Dnm3os, which was further confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization immunofluorescence. Furthermore, nucleolin levels were decreased in diabetic conditions, and its knockdown enhanced Dnm3os-induced inflammatory gene expression and histone H3K9-acetylation at their promoters. Conclusions- These results demonstrate novel mechanisms involving upregulation of long noncoding RNA Dnm3os, disruption of its interaction with nucleolin, and epigenetic modifications at target genes that promote macrophage inflammatory phenotype in diabetes mellitus. The data could lead to long noncoding RNA-based therapies for inflammatory diabetes mellitus complications."

            "abstract": "A lasting imbalance between fatty acid synthesis and consumption leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), coupled with hepatitis and insulin resistance. Yet the details of the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we unraveled that the expression of the transcription factor Zbtb18 is markedly decreased in the livers of both patients and murine models of NAFLD. Hepatic Zbtb18 knockout promoted NAFLD features like impaired energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and induced insulin resistance. Conversely, hepatic Zbtb18 overexpression alleviated hepato-steatosis, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia in mice fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) or in diabetic mice. Notably, in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies revealed that Zbtb18 transcriptional activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mediated FAO and Clathrin Heavy Chain (CLTC) protein hinders NLRP3 inflammasome activity. This key mechanism by which hepatocyte's Zbtb18 expression alleviates NAFLD and consequent liver fibrosis was further verified by FXR's deletion and forced expression in mice and cultured mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs). Moreover, CLTC deletion significantly abrogated the hepatic Zbtb18 overexpression-driven inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages. Altogether, Zbtb18 transcriptionally activates the FXR-mediated FAO and CLTC expression, which inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome's activity alleviating inflammatory stress and insulin resistance, representing an attractive remedy for hepatic steatosis and fibrosis."

However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism is poorly understood. Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 16 (KLF16) is a transcription factor that abounds in liver. We explored whether and by what mechanisms KLF16 affects hepatic lipid catabolism to improve hepatosteatosis and insulin resistance. DESIGN: KLF16 expression was determined in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and mice models. The role of KLF16 in the regulation of lipid metabolism was investigated using hepatocyte-specific KLF16-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or using an adenovirus/adeno-associated virus to alter KLF16 expression in mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs) and in vivo livers. RNA-seq, luciferase reporter gene assay and ChIP analysis served to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. RESULTS: KLF16 expression was decreased in patients with NAFLD, mice models and oleic acid and palmitic acid (OA and PA) cochallenged hepatocytes. Hepatic KLF16 knockout impaired fatty acid oxidation, aggravated mitochondrial stress, ROS burden, advancing hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Conversely, KLF16 overexpression reduced lipid deposition and improved insulin resistance via directly binding the promoter of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) to accelerate fatty acids oxidation and attenuate mitochondrial stress, oxidative stress in db/db and HFD mice. PPAR\u03b1 deficiency diminished the KLF16-evoked protective effects against lipid deposition in MPHs. Hepatic-specific PPAR\u03b1 overexpression effectively rescued KLF16 deficiency-induced hepatic steatosis, altered redox balance and insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings prove that a direct KLF16-PPAR\u03b1 pathway closely links hepatic lipid homeostasis and redox balance, whose dysfunction promotes insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis."

                "abstract": "Hepatic insulin resistance (IR), as a downstream sequela of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is strongly associated with liver steatosis. Despite numerous mechanism advancements, the molecular underpinnings and pathogenesis of hepatic IR, especially regarding the pattern recognition receptors in hepatocytes, remain elusive. Here, we identified hepatocyte NLRP3 as a direct and previously-unresolved driver of hepatic IR to promote steatosis response. Under the model of NAFLD, we identified hepatocyte NLRP3 as a crucial inducer of hepatic IR by undertaking multilayer transcriptomic searches and further confirmed that its expression was increased in the liver tissues from NAFLD patients and mouse models (high-fat diet (HFD), leptin-receptor-deficient (db/db) mice), and in palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatocytes. Loss- or gain-of-function of hepatocyte-specific NLRP3 in HFD-induced mice ameliorated or exacerbated hepatic IR and steatosis, respectively. Mechanistically, NLRP3 directly bound to and promoted protein kinase C epsilon (PKC\u03b5) activation to impair insulin signaling and increase liver steatosis, while inhibition of PKC\u03b5 activation dampened the beneficial effects seen in HFD-induced NLRP3-deficient mice. Moreover, we performed screening and discovered that the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) positively controlled NLRP3 expression. In translational potential, adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated NLRP3 knockdown in the liver alleviated hepatic IR and steatosis in db/db mice, and pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 markedly alleviated diet-induced metabolic disorders. This finding reveals a previously-unexpected regulatory axis from YY1 to PKC\u03b5 via NLRP3 induction for metabolic diseases and establishes the YY1-NLRP3-PKC\u03b5 axis as a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD."

                "abstract": "Oxidative stress-mediated activation of inflammasome has a significant effect on the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4, FXR) has been implicated in biological function and many diseases, including NAFLD. The regulatory effect of FXR on oxidative stress and whether this process is related with the activation of absent melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome in NAFLD remain unclear. In the present research, we confirmed that FXR in the livers of steatosis patients is significantly reduced compared with normal liver tissue by using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and a palmitic acid (PA) - mediated steatosis model in AML-12 cells. Under the premise of ensuring the same food intake as the control group, overexpression of FXR in mice attenuated HFD-mediated weight gain and liver steatosis, facilitated lipid metabolism, improved fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, lipolysis, and reduced fatty acid synthesis and intake, which also inhibited the activation of AIM2 inflammasome. Overexpression of FXR alleviated PA-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation, imbalance of lipid homeostasis, and the activation of AIM2 inflammasome in hepatic steatosis cells, while FXR knockdown appeared the opposite effects. FXR overexpression suppressed PA- and HFD-induced oxidative stress, but FXR siRNA demonstrated the opposite influence. The decreased ROS generation may be the reason why FXR weakens AIM2 activation when a fatty acid overload occurs. In conclusion, our results confirm that other than regulating lipid homeostasis and blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation, FXR improves hepatic steatosis by a novel mechanism that inhibits oxidative stress and AIM2 inflammasome activation."

It has been widely administered in clinical practice to treat jaundice associated with damp-heat pathogen and obesity. Emodin (EMO) is a major bioactive constituent of CMD that has apparent therapeutic efficacy against obesity and fatty liver. Here, we investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of EMO against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether EMO activates farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling to alleviate HFD-induced NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo assays included serum biochemical indices tests, histopathology, western blotting, and qRT-PCR to evaluate the effects of EMO on glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in wild type (WT) and FXR knockout mice maintained on an HFD. In vitro experiments included intracellular triglyceride (TG) level measurement and Oil Red O staining to assess the capacity of EMO to remove lipids induced by oleic acid and palmitic acid in WT and FXR knockout mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs). We also detected mRNA expression of FXR signaling genes in MPHs. RESULTS: After HFD administration, body weight and serum lipid and inflammation levels were dramatically increased in the WT mice. The animals also presented with impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and antioxidant capacity, liver tissue attenuation, and pathological injury. EMO remarkably reversed the foregoing changes in HFD-induced mice. EMO improved HFD-induced lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice by inhibiting FXR expression. EMO also significantly repressed TG hyperaccumulation by upregulating FXR expression in MPHs. However, it did not improve lipid accumulation, insulin sensitivity, or glucose tolerance in HFD-fed FXR knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that EMO alleviates HFD-induced NAFLD by activating FXR signaling which improves lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress."

                "abstract": "The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as a critical liver disease, is still lack of effective treatments because the molecular mechanism revealing the NAFLD pathogenesis remains unclear. Dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP7) shows effects on inflammatory response and is a negative feedback mechanism of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, which are critical factors in regulating NAFLD progression. However, the effects of DUSP7 on hepatic steatosis are still not fully understood. Here, we found that DUSP7 functioned as a negative regulator of NAFLD and in various metabolic disorders. DUSP7 expression was markedly reduced in liver samples from patients with simple hepatic steatosis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-challenged mice or genetically obese (ob/ob) mice. DUSP7 knockout markedly accelerated insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, liver dysfunction, fibrosis and hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. In addition, inflammatory response was significantly exacerbated in HFD-challenged mice with DUSP7 deletion, which was associated with the elevated activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and MAPKs signaling pathways. Moreover, oxidative stress was detected in liver of HFD-induced mice, and this phenomenon was aggravated in mice with DUSP7 knockout. Importantly, we demonstrated that DUSP7 physically interacted with transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-activated kinase (TAK1). DUSP7 deletion considerably promoted the activation of TAK1 in mice after HFD feeding, contributing to the lipid deposition, inflammatory response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Taken together, DUSP7 might function as a protective factor against NAFLD development and metabolic disorder through alleviating dyslipidemia, inflammation and oxidative stress by directly interacting with TAK1 in hepatocytes, which was involved in the suppression of fibrosis. Thus, we may provide an effective strategy for the treatment of hepatic steatosis via targeting DUSP7."

METHODS: Higd1a, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, was knocked down or overexpressed in mice livers by tail vein injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. High fat diet-induced obese mice were subjected to treadmill training. Alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) cells were used for in vitro studies. RESULTS: Higd1a was upregulated in mice livers after treadmill exercise training. Knockdown of Higd1a in diet-induced obese mice livers impaired exercise-mediated alleviation of hepatic steatosis, liver injury and inflammation. On the contrary, hepatic overexpression of Higd1a ameliorated fatty liver, liver injury and inflammation in synergy with exercise. Mechanistically, deficiency of Higd1a in hepatocytes promoted free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress, and elevated the cytosolic level of oxidized mitochondrial DNA (ox-mtDNA) to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and JNK signaling, leading to decreased expression of critical genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), such as Ppara, Cpt1a and Acadm. Overexpression of Higd1a in hepatocytes blunted the above effects, which ultimately increased FAO genes expression and alleviated fat accumulation in hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: These results identify a Higd1a-mediated inhibition of cytosolic ox-mtDNA/NLRP3 inflammasomes/JNK pathway that facilitates exercise-mediated alleviation of hepatosteatosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most studies on the role of STAMP2 in metabolism have used adipose tissue. Little knowledge exists concerning the role of STAMP2 in the liver, which is a metabolically central target. We hypothesized that STAMP2 is involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. METHODS: We examined our hypothesis using human NAFLD patient pathology samples and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The molecular mechanism underlying hepatic STAMP2-mediated lipid imbalance was explored using an oleic acid (OA)-induced NAFLD in vitro model. RESULTS: Noticeably, the expression level of STAMP2 protein was reduced in the livers obtained from NAFLD patients and HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo knockdown of hepatic STAMP2 by siRNA accelerated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice fed a HFD. Conversely, the delivery of adenoviral STAMP2 (Ad-STAMP2) improved hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced NAFLD mice. The expression of lipogenic or adipogenic factors was increased in both in vitro and in vivo NAFLD models but was reversed by Ad-STAMP2. Adenoviral overexpression of STAMP2 improved insulin resistance in the HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that STAMP2 modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and that STAMP2 counteracts OA-induced insulin resistance by modulating insulin receptor substrate-1 stability. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that hepatic STAMP2 plays a pivotal role in preventing HFD-induced NAFLD and that STAMP2 overexpression improves hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD. Our findings indicate that STAMP2 may represent a suitable target for interventions targeting NAFLD."

                "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance (IR). However, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a vital role in NAFLD and IR. Our study aimed to explore whether NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to HHcy-induced NAFLD and IR as well as dissected the underlying mechanism. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-methionine diet (HMD) for 8\u00a0weeks to establish the HHcy mouse model. Compared with a chow diet, HMD induced hepatic steatosis (HS) and IR as well as activation of hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, HHcy-induced NAFLD and IR characterization disclosed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurred in liver tissue of HMD-fed mice, but was very marginal in either NLRP3-/- or Caspase-1-/- mice. Mechanistically, high levels of homocysteine (Hcy) up-regulated the expression of mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), which directly ubiquitinates heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and consequently activated hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo and in vitro. In addition, in vitro experiments showed P300-mediated HSF1 acetylation at K298 hindered MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of HSF1 at K372, which plays important role in determining the HSF1 level. Importantly, either inhibition of MDM2 by JNJ-165 or activation of HSF1 by HSF1A reversed HMD-induced hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome, and consequently alleviated HS and IR in mice. This study demonstrates that NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to HHcy-induced NAFLD and IR, and further identified that HSF1 as a new substrate of MDM2 and its decrease on MDM2-mediated ubiquitination at K372 modulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These findings may provide novel therapeutic strategies aimed at halting HS or IR."

NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammatory infiltration was determined to participate in NAFLD. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was recently confirmed as an essential regulator for apoptosis in cells. However, the role of XIAP in HFD-induced NAFLD is still not understood. Here, XIAP was characterized with respect to HFD-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in vivo and palmitate (PA)-treated cells in vitro. After HFD administration, hepatic injury was confirmed via histological assessment (grading and staging of NAFLD) and biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, and reduced antioxidant activity. Up-regulated hepatic dysfunction were further indicated by elevated dyslipidemia, lipid accumulation, and decreased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation associated gene expression. Moreover, in the absence of XIAP, NLRP3 signaling activated by HFD-triggered oxidative stress was up-regulated, accompanied by reduction in antioxidants including HO-1, NQO-1, GST, SOD and Nrf2 activity. The detrimental effects of XIAP blocking on hepatic steatosis and related pathologies were also confirmed in PA-treated mouse liver cells. In contrast, overexpression of XIAP by transfection in vitro restrained PA-stimulated hepatic steatosis by suppression of oxidative stress, NLRP3 related inflammatory response, and impairment of Nrf2 activity, further alleviating abnormal metabolic disorder associated NAFLD. Taken together, the present study helped to elucidate how HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was regulated by XIAP, possibly via the inhibition of NLRP3 signaling and oxidative stress injury."

                "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a wide spectrum of liver pathology. Intracellular lipid accumulation is the first step in the development and progression of NAFLD. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) plays an important role in the synthesis of bile acid and intracellular lipid homeostasis and cholesterol metabolism. We hypothesize that StAR is involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. The hypothesis was identified using free fatty acid (FFA)-overloaded NAFLD in vitro model and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model transfected by recombinant adenovirus encoding StAR (StAR). StAR expression was also examined in pathology samples of patients with fatty liver by immunohistochemical staining. We found that the expression level of StAR was reduced in the livers obtained from fatty liver patients and NAFLD mice. Additionally, StAR overexpression decreased the levels of hepatic lipids and maintained the hepatic glucose homeostasis due to the activation of farnesoid x receptor (FXR). StAR overexpression attenuated the impairment of insulin signaling in fatty liver. This protective role of StAR was owing to a reduction of intracellular diacylglycerol levels and the phosphorylation of PKC\u03b5. Furthermore, FXR inactivation reversed the observed beneficial effects of StAR. The present study revealed that StAR overexpression can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, regulate glucose metabolism and attenuate insulin resistance through a mechanism involving the activation of FXR. Our study suggests that StAR may be a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD."

                "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and inflammation, and the pathogenic mechanism of NAFLD is poorly understood. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10), a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, is involved in environmental stress responses, tumor growth, inflammation, and cellular metabolism. However, the role of USP10 in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation remains largely unexplored. USP10 expression was detected in livers of patients with NAFLD, mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice, as well as in palmitate-induced hepatocytes. The function of USP10 in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation was investigated using hepatocyte-specific USP10 deficiency or overexpression in mice induced by HFD treatment or genetic defect. The molecular mechanisms underlying USP10-regulated hepatic steatosis were further investigated in HFD-treated mice. USP10 expression was significantly decreased in the fatty livers of NAFLD patients and obese mice and in palmitate-treated hepatocytes. USP10 deficiency exacerbated the metabolic dysfunction induced by HFD treatment for 12 weeks. Conversely, USP10 overexpression significantly suppressed metabolic dysfunction in mice after HFD treatment and inhibited the development of NAFLD in ob/ob mice. Further investigation indicated that USP10 regulates hepatic steatosis by interacting with Sirt6 and inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation. Sirt6 overexpression markedly ameliorated the effects of USP10 deficiency in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Conversely, Sirt6 deficiency decreased the ameliorative effects of USP10 overexpression in response to HFD treatment. Conclusion: USP10 inhibits hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation through Sirt6."

Therefore, we investigated whether oral administration of sulforaphane (SFN) prevented high-fat diet-induced NAFLD in mice by regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver. Daily oral administrations of SFN reduced hepatic steatosis scores, serum ALT and AST levels, and hepatic levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids in mice fed a high-fat diet. These were correlated with the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the liver by SFN as evidenced by decrease in mRNA levels of ASC and caspase-1, caspase-1 enzyme activity, and IL-1\u03b2 levels. SFN inhibited saturated fatty acid-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in primary mouse hepatocytes, accompanied by the restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction. The suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome by SFN was mediated by the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase-autophagy axis. Our findings demonstrated that the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by an orally available small molecule inhibitor leads to the alleviation of the hepatic steatosis symptoms associated with NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet.

This study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of restraint stress-induced NASH, which mimics psychological stress, and to discover potential NASH candidates. Methionine choline deficient diet- and high fat diet-induced hepatosteatotic mice are subjected to restraint stress to induce NASH. The mice are administrated with Xiaoyaosan granules, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, or macrophage scavengers. Pathological changes and NLRP3 signaling in the liver are determined. These results demonstrate that restraint stress promotes hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in hepatosteatotic mice. Restraint stress increases the expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1, Gasdermin D, interleukin-1\u03b2, cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase, and sterol 12\u03b1-hydroxylase and decreases the expression of FXR in NASH mice. Xiaoyaosan granules reverse hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and target FXR and NLRP3 signals. In addition, inhibition of NLRP3 reduces the NLRP3 inflammasome and liver damage in mice with restraint stress-induced NASH. Elimination of macrophages and activation of FXR also attenuate inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting NLRP3 signaling. However, NLRP3 inhibitors or macrophage scavengers fail to affect the expression of FXR. In conclusion, restraint stress promotes NASH-related inflammation and fibrosis by regulating the FXR/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Xiaoyaosan granules, NLRP3 inhibitors, FXR agonists, and macrophage scavengers are potential candidates for the treatment of psychological stress-related NASH."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a platform for caspase-1 activation and release of interleukin 1\u03b2, is increasingly recognized in the induction of inflammation and liver fibrosis during NAFLD. However, the cell-specific contribution of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in NAFLD remains unknown. METHODS: To investigate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and myeloid cells, a conditional Nlrp3 knock-out mouse was generated and bred to cell-specific Cre mice. Both acute and chronic liver injury models were used: lipopolysaccharide/adenosine-triphosphate to induce in\u00a0vivo NLRP3 activation, choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet, and Western-type diet to induce fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In\u00a0vitro co-culture studies were performed to dissect the crosstalk between myeloid cells and HSCs. RESULTS: Myeloid-specific deletion of Nlrp3 blunted the systemic and hepatic increase in interleukin 1\u03b2 induced by lipopolysaccharide/adenosine-triphosphate injection. In the choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet model of fibrotic NASH, myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out but not hepatocyte- or HSC-specific knock-out mice showed significant reduction in inflammation independent of steatosis development. Moreover, myeloid-specific Nlrp3 knock-out mice showed ameliorated liver fibrosis and decreased HSC activation. These results were validated in the Western-type diet model. In\u00a0vitro co-cultured studies with human cell lines demonstrated that HSC can be activated by inflammasome stimulation in monocytes, and this effect was significantly reduced if NLRP3 was downregulated in monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides new insights in the cell-specific role of NLRP3 in liver inflammation and fibrosis. NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells was identified as crucial for the progression of NAFLD to fibrotic NASH. These results may have implications for the development of cell-specific strategies for modulation of NLRP3 activation for treatment of fibrotic NASH."

Moreover, knocking down NLRP3 expression significantly attenuated uric acid-induced fat accumulation both in HepG2 cells and L02 cells. Knocking down NLRP3 expression also rescued uric acid-induced insulin signaling impairment in both cell types.

Here, we report the deficiency of miR-192-3p in the livers of mice with diabetes and its role in alleviating hepatic steatosis. METHODS: As conventional pre-microRNA (miRNA) stem-loop overexpression only boosts guiding strand (i.e. miR-192-5p) expression, we adopted an artificial AAV(DJ)-directed, RNA Pol III promoter-driven miRNA hairpin construct for star-strand-specific overexpression in the liver. Liver steatosis and insulin resistance markers were evaluated in primary hepatocytes, mice with diabetes, and mice with excessive carbohydrate consumption. RESULTS: Functional loss of miR-192-3p in liver exacerbated hepatic micro-vesicular steatosis and insulin resistance in either mice with diabetes or wild-type mice with excessive fructose consumption. Liver-specific overexpression of miR-192-3p effectively halted hepatic steatosis and ameliorated insulin resistance in these mice models. Likewise, hepatocytes overexpressing miR-192-3p exhibited improved lipid accumulation, accompanied with decreases in lipogenesis and lipid-accumulation-related transcripts. Mechanistically, glucocorticoid receptor (GCR, also known as nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 [NR3C1]) was demonstrated to be negatively regulated by miR-192-3p. The effect of miR-192-3p on mitigating micro-vesicular steatosis was ablated by the reactivation of NR3C1. CONCLUSIONS: The star strand miR-192-3p was an undermined glycerolipid regulator involved in controlling fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity in liver through blockade of hepatic GCR signalling; this miRNA may serve as a potential therapeutic option for the common co-mobility of diabetic mellitus and fatty liver disease. LAY SUMMARY: The potential regulatory activity of star strand microRNA (miRNA) species has been substantially underestimated. In this study, we investigate the role and mechanism of an overlooked star strand miRNA (miR-192-3p) in regulating hepatic steatosis and insulin signalling in the livers of mice with diabetes and mice under excessive carbohydrate consumption."

B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X protein (Bax) inhibitor-1 (BI-1), a negative regulator of the ER stress sensor, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1\u03b1), has yet to be explored in NAFLD as a hepatoprotective agent. We hypothesized that the genetic ablation of BI-1 would render the liver vulnerable to NASH because of unrestrained IRE1\u03b1 signaling. ER stress was induced in wild-type and BI-1-/- mice acutely by tunicamycin (TM) injection (1 mg/kg) or chronically by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to determine NAFLD phenotype. Livers of TM-treated BI-1-/- mice showed IRE1\u03b1-dependent NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, hepatocyte death, fibrosis, and dysregulated lipid homeostasis that led to liver failure within a week. The analysis of human NAFLD liver biopsies revealed BI-1 down-regulation parallel to the up-regulation of IRE1\u03b1 endoribonuclease (RNase) signaling. In HFD-fed BI-1-/- mice that presented NASH and type 2 diabetes, exaggerated hepatic IRE1\u03b1, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression was linked to activated NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1/-11. Rises in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and alanine transaminase (ALT)/aspartate transaminase (AST) levels revealed significant inflammation and injury, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity with the small molecules, STF-083010 or 4\u03bc8c, was evaluated in HFD-induced NAFLD. In BI-1-/- mice, either treatment effectively counteracted IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity, improving glucose tolerance and rescuing from NASH. The hepatocyte-specific role of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity in mediating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell death was confirmed in primary mouse hepatocytes by IRE1\u03b1 axis knockdown or its inhibition with STF-083010 or 4\u03bc8c.

We found that the expressions of NLRP3 and TXNIP in human liver tissues were higher in NASH group than in NAFL group. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analyses show that activation of the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex occurred in KCs of NASH WT mice rather than NAFL WT mice, thus suggesting that the formation and activation of this protein complex is mainly involved in the development of NASH. NLRP3-/- mice exhibited less severe NASH than WT mice in MCD diet model, whereas TXNIP deficiency enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and exacerbated liver injury. PA triggered the activation and co-localization of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex in KCs isolated from WT and TXNIP-/- but not NLRP3-/- mice, and most of the complex co-localized with mitochondria of KCs following PA stimulation.

Schaftoside (SS) is a bioactive compound of Herba Desmodii Styracifolii, which has traditionally been used to treat hepatitis and cholelithiasis. However, the potential hepatoprotective effect of SS against NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated whether SS could improve NAFLD-induced liver injury by decreasing lipid accumulation via the activation of FXR signalling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, the effects of SS on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid accumulation in the liver of mice were evaluated by serum biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis. In vitro, the intracellular triglyceride (TG) level and Oil Red O staining were used to evaluate the lipid removal ability of SS in Huh-7\u00a0cells or FXR knockout mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs) induced by oleic acid (OA). Moreover, FXR/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) mRNA and protein expression levels were detected. RESULTS: SS reduced HFD-induced lipid accumulation in the liver, as indicated by decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol (Ch), and TG levels in serum and TG levels in liver tissue, and subsequently resulting in attenuation of liver histopathological injury. Gene expression profiles demonstrated that SS dose-dependently prevented HFD-induced decrease of FXR expression and inversely inhibited SREBP1 expression in the nucleus. Furthermore, SS significantly suppressed excessive TG accumulation and decreased intracellular TG level in Huh-7\u00a0cells or MPHs via the upregulation of FXR and inhibition of SREBP1 expression in the nucleus. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SS ameliorates HFD-induced NAFLD by the decrease of lipid accumulation via the control of FXR-SREBP1 signalling."

In mice fed an methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet, we gavaged MCC950 or vehicle for 6weeks and determined the effects on liver fibrosis. RESULTS: In vehicle-treated foz/foz mice, hepatic expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1\u03b2, active caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 increased at 24weeks, in association with cholesterol crystal formation and NASH pathology; plasma IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, ALT/AST all increased. MCC950 treatment normalized hepatic caspase 1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression, plasma IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1 and IL-6, lowered ALT/AST, and reduced the severity of liver inflammation including designation as NASH pathology, and liver fibrosis. In vitro, cholesterol crystals activated Kupffer cells and macrophages to release IL-1\u03b2; MCC950 abolished this, and the associated neutrophil migration. MCD diet-fed mice developed fibrotic steatohepatitis; MCC950 suppressed the increase in hepatic caspase 1 and IL-1\u03b2, lowered numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the liver, and improved liver fibrosis. CONCLUSION: MCC950, an NLRP3 selective inhibitor, improved NAFLD pathology and fibrosis in obese diabetic mice. This is potentially attributable to the blockade of cholesterol crystal-mediated NLRP3 activation in myeloid cells. MCC950 reduced liver fibrosis in MCD-fed mice. Targeting NLRP3 is a logical direction in pharmacotherapy of NASH. LAY SUMMARY: Fatty liver disease caused by being overweight with diabetes and a high risk of heart attack, termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the most common serious liver disease with no current treatment. There could be several causes of inflammation in NASH, but activation of a protein scaffold within cells termed the inflammasome (NLRP3) has been suggested to play a role. Here we show that cholesterol crystals could be one pathway to activate the inflammasome in NASH. We used a drug called MCC950, which has already been shown to block NLRP3 activation, in an attempt to reduce liver injury in NASH. This drug partly reversed liver inflammation, particularly in obese diabetic mice that most closely resembles the human context of NASH. In addition, such dampening of liver inflammation in NASH achieved with MCC950 partly reversed liver scarring, the process that links NASH to the development of cirrhosis."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The T helper 17 (Th17)/T regulatory (Treg) cell imbalance is involved in the course of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the current study, the exact role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) exenatide on regulating the Th17/Treg balance and the underlying molecular mechanisms are investigated in obese diabetic mice model. METHODS: Metabolic parameters were monitored in db/db mice treated with/without exenatide during 8-week study period. The frequencies of Th17 and Treg cells from peripheral blood and pancreas in db/db mice were assessed. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) pathway in Th17 and Treg cells from the spleens of male C57BL/6J mice was detected by western blotting. In addition, the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of male C57BL/6J mice was analyzed. RESULTS: Exenatide treatment improved \u03b2-cell function and insulitis in addition to glucose, insulin sensitivity and weight. Increased Th17 and decreased Treg cells in peripheral blood were present as diabetes progressed while exenatide corrected this imbalance. Progressive IL-17\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration of pancreatic islets was alleviated by exenatide intervention. In vitro study showed no significant difference in the level of GLP-1R expression in PBMCs between control and palmitate (PA) groups. In addition, PA could promote Th17 but suppress Treg differentiation along with down-regulating the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/FoxO1, which was reversed by exenatide intervention. FoxO1 inhibitor AS1842856 could abrogate all these effects of exenatide against lipid stress. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide could restore systemic Th17/Treg balance via regulating FoxO1 pathway with the progression of diabetes in db/db mice. The protection of pancreatic \u03b2-cell function may be partially mediated by inhibiting Th17 cell infiltration into pancreatic islets, and the resultant alleviation of islet inflammation."

                "abstract": "Liraglutide, a modified form of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), has been found to improve beta cell function in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, the effect of liraglutide on beta cell function under lipotoxic stress and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling in liraglutide-involved beta cell protection in high free fatty acids (FFAs) condition. The apoptosis, proliferation, and insulin secretion capability of MIN6 cells and islets from C57BL/6J mice were evaluated when exposed to FFAs with/without liraglutide. The expression of effectors involved in PI3K/Akt/FoxO1signalling pathway was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting in MIN6 cells and islets from C57BL/6J mice. Liraglutide substantially inhibited the lipoapoptosis and improved the proliferation and insulin secretion of beta cells in high FFAs condition. Western blot revealed that the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 was markedly decreased under lipid stress but was elevated when treated with liraglutide. Moreover, FFAs could up-regulate the expression levels of p27, Bax, Cidea but down-regulate the expression levels of Pdx-1, MafA, and NeuroD in beta cells, which was canceled by the addition of liraglutide. Moreover, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, could significantly abrogate all the protective actions of liraglutide against lipotoxicity. We concluded that liraglutide markedly improved beta cell function under lipid stress and that the protective action of liraglutide was mediated by activation of PI3K/Akt, which resulted in inactivation of FoxO1 along with the down-regulation of p27, Bax, Cidea and up-regulation of Pdx-1, MafA, and NeuroD expressions."

                "abstract": "Liraglutide, a human long-lasting GLP-1 analogue, is currently regarded as a powerful treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Apart from glucoregulatory and insulinotropic actions, liraglutide increases \u03b2-cell mass through stimulation of \u03b2-cell proliferation and islet neogenesis, as well as inhibition of \u03b2-cell apoptosis. However, the underline molecular mechanisms have not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which liraglutide preserves islet \u03b2-cells in an animal model of overt diabetes, the obese db/db mice, and protects a mouse pancreatic \u03b2-cell line (\u03b2TC-6 cells) against apoptosis. Treatment of 12-week-old diabetic mice with liraglutide for 2\u00a0weeks had no appreciable effects on blood non-fasting glucose concentration, islet insulin content and body weight. However, morphological and biochemical examination of diabetic mouse pancreatic islets demonstrated that liraglutide restores islet size, reduces islet \u03b2-cell apoptosis and improves nephrin expression, a protein involved in \u03b2-cell survival signalling. Our results indicated that liraglutide protects \u03b2TC-6 cells from serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis through inhibition of caspase-3 activation. The molecular mechanism of the anti-apoptotic action of liraglutide in \u03b2TC-6-cells comprises stimulation of PI3-kinase-dependent AKT phosphorylation leading to the phosphorylation, hence inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and inhibition of FoxO1 transcription factor. In conclusion, we provided evidence that the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide exerts important beneficial effects on pancreatic islet architecture and \u03b2-cell survival by protecting cells against apoptosis. These findings extend our understanding of the actions of liraglutide and further support the use of GLP-1R agonists in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes."

                "abstract": "Diabetes is characterized by a loss and dysfunction of the \u03b2-cell. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling plays an important role in \u03b2-cell survival and function. It is meaningful to identify promising agents from natural products which might activate GLP-1R signaling. In this study, puerarin, a diet isoflavone, was evaluated its beneficial effects on \u03b2-cell survival and GLP-1R pathway. We showed that puerarin reduced the body weight gain, normalized blood glucose, and improved glucose tolerance in high-fat diet-induced and db/db diabetic mice. Most importantly, increased \u03b2-cell mass and \u03b2-cell proliferation but decreased \u03b2-cell apoptosis were observed in puerarin-treated diabetic mice as examined by immunostaining of mice pancreatic sections. The protective effect of puerarin on \u03b2-cell survival was confirmed in isolated mouse islets treated with high glucose. Further mechanism studies showed that the circulating level of GLP-1 in mice was unaffected by puerarin. However, puerarin enhanced GLP-1R signaling by up-regulating expressions of GLP-1R and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1, which subsequently led to protein kinase B (Akt) activation but forkhead box O1 inactivation, and promoted \u03b2-cell survival. The protective effect of puerarin was remarkably suppressed by Exendin(9-39), an antagonist of GLP-1R. Our study demonstrated puerarin improved glucose homeostasis in obese diabetic mice and identified a novel role of puerarin in protecting \u03b2-cell survival by mechanisms involving activation of GLP-1R signaling and downstream targets.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research on the imbalance of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus holds potential insights into the pathophysiology of diabetes. Jinkui Shenqi pills (JSP), a prevalent traditional Chinese medicine, regulate hypothalamic function and treat diabetes. PURPOSE: To investigate the hypoglycemic effect of JSP and explore the probable mechanism in treating diabetes. METHODS: A type 2 diabetes mouse model was used to investigate the pharmacodynamics of JSP. The glucose-lowering efficacy of JSP was assessed through various metrics including body weight, food consumption, fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin levels, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). To elucidate the modulatory effects of JSP on hypothalamic mechanisms, we quantified the expression and activity of POMC and AgRP and assessed the insulin-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase A (AKT)/forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) pathway in diabetic mice via western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, primary hypothalamic neurons were exposed to high glucose and palmitic acid levels to induce insulin resistance, and the influence of JSP on POMC/AgRP protein expression and activation was evaluated by PI3K protein inhibition using western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Medium- and high-dose JSP treatment effectively inhibited appetite, resulting in a steady declining trend in body weight, FBG, and OGTT results in diabetic mice (p < 0.05). These JSP groups also had significantly increased insulin levels (p < 0.05). Importantly, the medium-dose group exhibited notable protection of hypothalamic neuronal and synaptic structures, leading to augmentation of dendritic length and branching (p < 0.05). Furthermore, low-, medium-, and high-dose JSP groups exhibited increased phosphorylated (p) INSR, PI3K, pPI3K, AKT, and pAKT expression, as well as decreased FOXO1 and increased pFOXO1 expression, indicating improved hypothalamic insulin resistance in diabetic mice (p < 0.05). Treatment with 10% JSP-enriched serum produced a marked elevation of both expression and activation of POMC (p < 0.05), with a concurrent reduction in AgRP expression and activation within primary hypothalamic neurons (p < 0.05). Intriguingly, these effects could be attributed to the regulatory dynamics of PI3K activity. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that JSP can ameliorate diabetes by regulating POMC/AgRP expression and activity. The insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway plays an important regulatory role in this intricate process."

On the animal level, type-2-diabetic (T2D) mice were generated by high-fat-diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ). LGP9 was given to T2D mice for four weeks at doses of 1 mg kg-1, 3 mg kg-1, and 9 mg kg-1. A variety of techniques (immunohistochemistry, western blot, QPCR, and ELISA) were employed to evaluate the impact of LGP9 on the diabetic injury. On the cellular level, the pancreatic cell lines, Rin-m5f cells and Min6 cells, were treated with high-glucose (HG) and high-glucose-high-lipid (HG/PA), respectively. The cell models were established to investigate the mechanism of LGP9 treatment on the islet \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation. For the mechanism study, the PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 pathway was investigated by inhibiting FOXO1 with its inhibitor and siRNA. Results showed that LGP9 improved the \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation, prevented the EMT process, and upregulated the PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 signaling in the pancreas of T2D mice. In addition, LGP9 promoted the structural and functional recovery of pancreatic islets and shielded the liver tissue in T2D mice. From the cellular level data, LGP9 prevented \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation and EMT occurrence. To a certain extent, the inhibition of FOXO1 restored PI3K/Akt/FOXO1 pathway activation and prevented \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation. In conclusion, these findings suggest that LGP9 ameliorated pancreatic \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation via PI3k/Akt/FOXO1 signaling in vivo and in vitro."

                "abstract": "The level of serum angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), a novel hepatokine, is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aims of this study were to investigate whether serum ANGPTL8 level in patients with T2DM was affected by treatment with exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, and to determine whether and how GLP-1R agonists regulated ANGPTL8 production in hepatocytes. A multiple-center trial was conducted in China. Among 240 patients with T2DM enrolled in this trial, 195 patients adhered to a 16-week exenatide treatment and follow-up. Human liver cell line HepG2 cells were incubated for 24\u202fh with either exendin-4 (a native form of exenatide) or liraglutide in the presence or absence of GLP-1R antagonist exendin (9-39) and PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Change of serum ANGPTL8 level in patients with T2DM and regulation of ANGPTL8 production by the GLP-1R agonists in HepG2 cells were evaluated. Results showed that compared with baseline, exenatide treatment significantly increased serum ANGPTL8 level, and lowered body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM (all P\u202f<\u202f 0.05). The exenatide treatment-mediated upregulation of serum ANGPTL8 level was not associated with the levels of its lowering effects on body weight, FBG and HbA1c stratified by the median. Moreover, exendin-4 or liraglutide dose-dependently upregulated the level of ANGPTL8 expression and secretion in HepG2 cells, which was eliminated by adding exendin (9-39) and LY294002. In conclusion, GLP-1R agonists enhance ANGPTL8 production in vivo and in vitro, which is mediated via the PI3K/Akt pathway in a GLP-1R-dependent manner."

Although their attenuating effect on hepatic glucose output has drawn our attention for decades, the potential mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Cytokine array kit was used to assess cytokine profiles in db/db mice and mouse primary hepatocytes treated with exenatide (exendin-4). Two diabetic mouse models (db/db and Pax6m/+) were treated with a GLP-1 analog exenatide or liraglutide. The expression and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in the livers of diabetic mice, primary mouse and human hepatocytes, and the human hepatic cell line HepG2 treated with or without GLP-1 analog were measured. Blockage of FGF21 with neutralizing antibody or siRNA, or hepatocytes isolated from Fgf21 knockout mice were used, and the expression and activity of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis were analyzed. Serum FGF21 level was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving exenatide treatment. FINDINGS: Utilizing the cytokine array, we identified that FGF21 secretion was upregulated by exenatide (exendin-4). Similarly, FGF21 production in hepatocytes was stimulated by exenatide or liraglutide. FGF21 blockage attenuated the inhibitory effects of the GLP-1 analogs on hepatic glucose output. Similar results were also observed in primary hepatocytes from Fgf21 knockout mice. Furthermore, exenatide treatment increased serum FGF21 level in patients with T2D, particularly in those with better glucose control. INTERPRETATION: We identify that function of GLP-1 in inhibiting hepatic glucose output is mediated via the liver hormone FGF21. Thus, we provide a new extra-pancreatic mechanism by which GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis.

                "abstract": "AIMS: Studies on diabetes mellitus have shown that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine threonine kinase (AKT)/forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) signaling pathway can regulate insulin secretion by modulating the expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the pathway also played an important role in functional abnormalities of pancreatic islets after severe burns. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1/PDX-1 signaling pathway in functional changes of pancreatic islets in rats post severe burns. MAIN METHODS: Rats were grouped, subjected to full thickness burn injuries involving 50% total body surface area (TBSA), and injected intraperitoneally with BPV (HOpic) (0.6\u00a0mg/kg) or DMSO (0.55\u00a0mg/kg) once a day for three days. Glucose metabolism related indexes were measured by the glucometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PI3K/AKT/FoxO1/PDX-1 signaling pathway related indexes were detected through immunofluorescence, western blot and RT-qPCR analyses. KEY FINDINGS: Dysglycemia and impaired insulin secretion occurred in rats, the activity of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1/PDX-1 signaling pathway in the islets fell, and PDX-1 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm post severe burns. When BPV (HOpic) was used, glucose metabolism and insulin secretion were improved, the activity of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1/PDX-1 signaling pathway in the islets was up-regulated, and PDX-1 was redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. SIGNIFICANCE: The activity of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1/PDX-1 signaling pathway declined following severe burns. When its activity was up-regulated, insulin secretion could be improved, thus ameliorating hyperglycemia."

                "abstract": "An imbalance between T helper 17 (Th17) and T regulatory (Treg) cell subsets contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms that cause this imbalance are unknown. Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) has been suggested to affect Th17 polarization in a salt-dependent manner, and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been demonstrated to regulate sodium-mediated transportation in the renal tubules. This study aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of dapagliflozin (Dap) on DKD, as well as its influence on shifting renal T-cell polarization and related cytokine secretion. We treated male db/db mice with Dap or voglibose (Vog) and measured blood and kidney levels of Th17 and Treg cells using flow cytometry. We found that Th17 cells were significantly increased, while Treg cells were significantly decreased in diabetic mice. Moreover, Dap suppressed the polarization of Th17/Treg cells by inhibiting SGK1 in diabetic kidneys, and this was accompanied by attenuation of albuminuria and tubulointerstitial fibrosis independent of glycemic control. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells plays an important role in the progression of DKD. Moreover, Dap protects against DKD by inhibiting SGK1 and reversing the T-cell imbalance."

Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] can attenuate high glucose-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation of pancreatic \u03b2-cell, but the specific signal transduction pathway and mechanism are not yet clear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of Ang-(1-7) on high glucose-induced islet \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation by activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Protein kinase B/ Forkhead box transcription factor O1 (PI3K/Akt/FoxO1) signaling pathway. METHODS: The mouse islet \u03b2-cell line MIN6 cells were passaged and cultured and randomly divided into five groups: control (Con) group, high glucose (HG) group, HG with Ang-(1-7) group, HG with Ang-(1-7) and specific MasR antagonist A-779 group, and HG with Ang-(1-7) and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 group. After 48 hours, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was detected by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The mRNA and protein expression levels of \u03b2-cell-specific factors [Pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (Pdx1), v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A(MafA)] and endocrine progenitor cell-specific factors [Octamer binding transcription factor 4(Oct4), Nanog] were measured by Real Time-PCR and Western blot. The factors of protein expression levels of PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway (Akt, p-Akt, FoxO1, p-FoxO1) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: We observed for the first time that high glucotoxicity can induce dedifferentiation of pancreatic islet \u03b2-cell, causing a decrease in insulin secretion levels and expression of Pdx1, MafA, p-- FoxO1, and p-Akt and an increase in expression of Oct4 and Nanog. After Ang-(1-7) intervention, insulin secretion levels and expression of Pdx1, MafA, p-FoxO1 and p-Akt were increased, and the levels of Oct4 and Nanog were reduced. However, A-779 and LY294002 could reverse this effect. During these processes, the total Akt and total FoxO1 expression did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Ang-(1-7) may prevent high glucose-induced pathological dedifferentiation of pancreatic \u03b2-cell by activating the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway."

GLP-1 has a spectrum of anti-diabetic effects that are of possible utility in the treatment of more severe forms of diabetes. METHODS: The present study has evaluated the effect of once daily liraglutide injection (25 nmol/kg bw) for 15 days on metabolic control, islet architecture, and islet morphology in C57BL/KsJ db/db mice. RESULTS: Liraglutide had no appreciable effects on body weight, food intake, and non-fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. However, HbA1c was significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) decreased, and oral glucose tolerance improved in liraglutide treated db/db mice. Pancreatic insulin content was increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with saline controls, and the ratio of pancreatic insulin to glucagon in liraglutide mice was similar to lean mice. Although liraglutide did not alter islet number or area, the proportion of beta cells per islet was significantly increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and alpha cells decreased (p\u2009<\u20090.05), with normalization of islet architecture. In harmony with this, cell proliferation was significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) augmented and apoptosis reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in liraglutide treated mice. Expression of pancreatic islet glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide immunoreactivity was observed in lean control and, particularly, liraglutide treated db/db mice, whereas control db/db mice exhibited little glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide staining. CONCLUSION: These data reveal that stable GLP-1 analogues exert important beneficial effects on pancreatic islet architecture and beta-cell turnover, indicating that they may be useful in the treatment of severe forms of diabetes with islet degeneration."

                "abstract": "This study evaluated the capacity of mulberry anthocyanin extract (MAE) on insulin resistance amelioration in HepG2 cells induced by high glucose and palmitic acid and diabetes-related metabolic changes in type 2 diabetic mice. In vitro, MAE alleviated insulin resistance in HepG2 cells and increased glucose consumption, glucose uptake and glycogen content. Enzyme activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were decreased due to PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) inhibition. Furthermore, phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) in model cells was recovered after treated with MAE, leading to an up-regulation of glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2), and this effect was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. In vivo, MAE supplementation (50 and 125 mg/kg body weight per day) markedly decreased fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, leptin, triglyceride and cholesterol levels and increased adiponectin levels in db/db mice. The improvement of related metabolic parameters was in part associated with the impact of MAE on activating AKT and downstream targets in liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. In summary, these findings suggest that MAEs have potential benefits on improving dysfunction in diabetic mice and mitigating insulin resistance in HepG2 cells via activation of PI3K/AKT pathways."

                "abstract": "Dapagliflozin alleviates hyperglycemia by increasing glycosuria, but it induces renal gluconeogenesis, thus neutralizing its efficacy. Resveratrol (Rsv), a natural polyphenolic chemical, improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we investigated the regulatory effects and underlying mechanisms of Rsv on dapagliflozin-induced renal gluconeogenesis. Male ob/ob mice were given the vehicle (HF), dapagliflozin (1 mg kg-1), Rsv (10 mg kg-1), or dapagliflozin and Rsv combination for 10 weeks. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests. HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubule cells) were treated with dapagliflozin (1 \u03bcmol L-1) for 2 h and further incubated with Rsv (10 \u03bcmol L-1) for 12 h. The effects of Rsv on gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling were assessed. Dapagliflozin treatment increased glucose production in HK-2 cells and lowered blood glucose and induced gluconeogenesis in ob/ob mice. After Rsv treatment, the enhanced glucose production and gluconeogenesis were alleviated. The upregulated mRNA and protein expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and the activation of the forkhead transcription factor O1 (FoxO1) protein in the dapagliflozin group were attenuated by Rsv administration. Rsv also improved renal insulin signaling by increasing PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 dramatically decreased the p-Akt expression and activated FoxO1 by dephosphorylation, thus diminishing the inhibitory effects of Rsv on dapagliflozin-induced PEPCK and G6Pase expression. The data showed the mechanisms of Rsv in attenuating dapagliflozin-induced renal gluconeogenesis via activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and further suppressing FoxO1 activation, suggesting a potential intervention to achieve better glucose-lowering effects for SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D therapy."

However, its use as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the anti-T2DM effect of ECT and explored its potential molecular mechanism. In vivo, after treatment with ECT (20, 40\u00a0mg/kg) for 6 weeks, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was remarkably reduced in db/db mice. Moreover, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and hyperinsulinemia were ameliorated treatment with ECT. The values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) also showed that ECT could alleviate liver toxicity caused by diabetes in db/db mice. In vitro, ECT (15 and 30\u00a0\u03bcM) alleviated insulin resistance by increasing glucose consumption, glucose uptake and glycogen content in high glucose-induced HepG2 cells. The Western blotting (WB) results showed that ECT could upregulate the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), increase the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase B (AKT) in vivo and in vitro. Besides, ECT improved the glycogen content by inhibiting the expression of glycogen synthase kinase3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and promoting that of glycogen synthase (GS). Furthermore, administration of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002 abolished the beneficial effects of ECT. These findings are the first to verify that ECT has the potential to improve glucose metabolism and alleviate insulin resistance by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in db/db mice."

                "abstract": "The imbalance between T helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T (Treg) cells is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is a serine-threonine kinase critical for stabilizing the Th17\u00a0cell phenotype. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is a glucose transporter that serves as a treatment target for diabetes. Our study investigated the regulatory role of SGLT2 in the development of DN. The results revealed that SGLT2 knockdown suppressed high glucose-induced excessive secretion of sodium (Na+) and inflammatory cytokines in mouse renal tubular epithelial TCMK-1\u00a0cells. High Na+ content induced Th17 differentiation and upregulated SGK1, phosphorylated forkhead box protein O1 (p-FoxO1), and the interleukin 23 receptor (IL-23\u00a0R) in primary mouse CD4+ T cells. Co-culture of CD4+ T cells with the culture medium of TCMK-1\u00a0cells with insufficient SGLT2 expression significantly suppressed cell migration ability, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited Th17 differentiation possibly by downregulating SGK1, p-FoxO1, and IL-23\u00a0R. In addition, in vivo data demonstrated that SGLT2 knockdown markedly downregulated SGK1 in db/db mice. Insufficient SGLT2 or SGK1 expression also ameliorated the Th17/Treg imbalance, suppressed the development of DN, and regulated the expression of IL-23\u00a0R and p-FoxO1. In conclusion, this study showed that SGLT2 knockdown restored the Th17/Treg balance and suppressed DN possibly by regulating the SGK1/p-FoxO1/IL-23\u00a0R axis by altering Na+ content in the local environment. These findings highlight the potential use of SGLT2 and SGK1 for the management of DN."

In this study, we found that long-term glucagon intervention or glucagon intervention with the presence of palmitic acid downregulated \u03b2-cell-specific markers and inhibited insulin secretion in cultured \u03b2-cells. These results suggested that glucagon induced \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation under pathological conditions. Glucagon blockage by a glucagon receptor (GCGR) monoclonal antibody (mAb) attenuated glucagon-induced \u03b2-cell dedifferentiation.

                "abstract": "Orexin-A (OXA) regulates food intake and energy homeostasis. It increases insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro, although controversial effects of OXA on plasma glucagon are reported. We characterized the effects of OXA on glucagon secretion and identify intracellular target molecules in glucagon-producing cells. Glucagon secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas, isolated rat pancreatic islets, and clonal pancreatic A-cells (InR1-G9) were measured by RIA. The expression of orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The effects of OXA on cAMP, adenylate-cyclase-kinase (AKT), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)-1, forkhead box O-1 (Foxo1), and cAMP response element-binding protein were measured by ELISA and Western blot. Intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)(i)) concentration was detected by fura-2and glucagon expression by real-time PCR. Foxo1 was silenced in InR1-G9 cells by transfecting cells with short interfering RNA. OXR1 was expressed on pancreatic A and InR1-G9 cells. OXA reduced glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas, isolated rat pancreatic islets, and InR1-G9 cells. OXA inhibited proglucagon gene expression via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. OXA decreased cAMP and Ca(2+)(i) concentration and increased AKT, PDK-1, and Foxo1 phosphorylation. Silencing of Foxo1 caused a reversal of the inhibitory effect of OXA on proglucagon gene expression. Our study provides the first in vitro evidence for the interaction of OXA with pancreatic A cells. OXA inhibits glucagon secretion and reduces intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+)(i) concentration. OXA increases AKT/PDK-1 phosphorylation and inhibits proglucagon expression via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and Foxo-1-dependent pathways. As a physiological inhibitor of glucagon secretion, OXA may have a therapeutic potential to reduce hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes."

Elevated free fatty acids-induced lipotoxicity may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of \u03b2-cell insulin resistance. Exercise-stimulated myokine irisin has been reported to be closely related to T2DM. However, its function on \u03b2-cell insulin signaling and the underlying mechanisms are only partially elucidated as yet. METHODS: High-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice and palmitic acid-treated MIN6 cell models were utilized as lipotoxic models. Factors associated with \u03b2-cell insulin signaling transduction and inflammatory responses were assessed in these models. Furthermore, the role of irisin in \u03b2-cells and the underlying mechanisms were also explored. RESULTS: Irisin effectively decreased lipid levels in HFD mice, enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and nullified the expressions of inflammatory cytokines in vivo and in vitro experiments. Moreover, irisin improved PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathway and inhibited TLR4/NF-\u03baB inflammatory signaling pathway in both islets of HFD mice and PA-treated MIN6 cells. Mechanistic analysis indicated that FOXO1 might serve as a bridge between the two pathways. CONCLUSION: Irisin alleviates lipotoxicity-induced \u03b2-cell insulin resistance and inflammatory response through the activation of PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathways and the inhibition of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Irisin might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for T2DM."

However, it remains unknown whether FGF21 is involved in insulin expression and secretion that are dysregulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we found that FGF21 was down-regulated in pancreatic islets of db/db mice, a mouse model of T2DM, along with decreased insulin expression, suggesting the possible involvement of FGF21 in maintaining insulin homeostasis and islet \u03b2-cell function. Importantly, FGF21 knockout exacerbated palmitate-induced islet \u03b2-cell failure and suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Pancreatic FGF21 overexpression significantly increased insulin expression, enhanced GSIS, improved islet morphology and reduced \u03b2-cell apoptosis in db/db mice. Mechanistically, FGF21 promoted expression of insulin gene transcription factors and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, the major regulators of insulin secretion, as well as activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in islets of db/db mice. In addition, pharmaceutical inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling effectively suppressed FGF21-induced expression of insulin gene transcription factors and SNARE proteins, suggesting an essential role of PI3K/Akt signaling in FGF21-induced insulin expression and secretion. Taken together, our results demonstrate a protective role of pancreatic FGF21 in T2DM mice through inducing PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent insulin expression and secretion."

                "abstract": "The physiological role of the TGR5 receptor in the pancreas is not fully understood. We previously showed that activation of TGR5 in pancreatic \u03b2 cells by bile acids induces insulin secretion. Glucagon released from pancreatic \u03b1 cells and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal L cells regulate insulin secretion. Both glucagon and GLP-1 are derived from alternate splicing of a common precursor, proglucagon by PC2 and PC1, respectively. We investigated whether TGR5 activation in pancreatic \u03b1 cells enhances hyperglycemia-induced PC1 expression thereby releasing GLP-1, which in turn increases \u03b2 cell mass and function in a paracrine manner. TGR5 activation augmented a hyperglycemia-induced switch from glucagon to GLP-1 synthesis in human and mouse islet \u03b1 cells by GS/cAMP/PKA/cAMP-response element-binding protein-dependent activation of PC1. Furthermore, TGR5-induced GLP-1 release from \u03b1 cells was via an Epac-mediated PKA-independent mechanism. Administration of the TGR5 agonist, INT-777, to db/db mice attenuated the increase in body weight and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. INT-777 augmented PC1 expression in \u03b1 cells and stimulated GLP-1 release from islets of db/db mice compared with control. INT-777 also increased pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation and insulin synthesis. The effect of TGR5-mediated GLP-1 from \u03b1 cells on insulin release from islets could be blocked by GLP-1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that TGR5 activation mediates cross-talk between \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells by switching from glucagon to GLP-1 to restore \u03b2 cell mass and function under hyperglycemic conditions. Thus, INT-777-mediated TGR5 activation could be leveraged as a novel way to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. "

            "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is induced by the abundance of glucose and lipids, which causes glucolipotoxicity to the pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Silibinin is a natural flavonoid possessing the regulatory activity on insulin production and therapeutic activity in diabetic mice; however, its effect on glucolipotoxicity is not fully explained. This in vitro study investigates the effects of silibinin on palmitic acid (PA) and high glucose (HG)-induced cell loss and ferroptosis of rat insulinoma INS-1\u00a0cells. In the cells treated with PA and HG, expressions of glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) and carnitine acyltransferase I (CPT1) for \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids are reduced. Mitochondria are the metabolic organelles for glucose and fatty acids. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP production were decreased, while the ROS level was elevated in the cells treated with PA and HG, indicating an induction of mitochondrial disorder. Cell loss was partially rescued by ferroptosis inhibition, suggesting an involvement of ferroptosis in the cells treated with PA and HG. More importantly, the increases in total iron, lipid ROS, MDA and COX-2, and the decrease in ferroptosis inhibitory molecules GSH, GPX4 and FSP1 appeared in the cells treated with PA and HG, confirming the occurrence of ferroptosis. Moreover, PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, a vital process for selective elimination of damaged mitochondria, was blocked. Interestingly, silibinin rescued the mitochondria, restricted the ferroptosis and restored the mitophagy. By using the pharmacological stimulator and inhibitor of mitophagy, and si-RNA transfection to silence PINK1 expression, silibinin's protective effect against ferroptosis caused by PA and HG treatment was found to depend on mitophagy. Collectively, our current study reveals the new mechanisms for the protection of silibinin against the injury of INS-1\u00a0cells treated with PA and HG, elucidates the participation of ferroptosis in glucolipotoxicity, highlighting the involvement of mitophagy in defense against ferroptotic cell death."

However, therapies that can modulate the function of beta cells and thus prevent their failure have not been well explored. In this study, beta cell injury model was established with palmitic acid (PA) to simulate the lipotoxicity (high-fat diet) found in T2DM. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a novel physicochemical treatment, was applied to treat injured beta cells. We found that SDT had specific effects on mitochondria and induced transient large amount of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in beta cells. SDT also improved the morphology and function of abnormal mitochondria, inhibited inflammatory response and reduced beta cell dysfunction. The improvement of mitochondria was mediated by PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Additionally, SDT rescued the transcription of PINK1 mRNA which was blocked by PA treatment, thus providing abundant PINK1 for mitophagy. Moreover, SDT also increased insulin secretion from beta cells. The protective effects of SDT were abrogated when mitophagy was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). In summary, SDT potently inhibits lipotoxicity-induced beta cell failure via PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, providing theoretical guidance for T2DM treatment in aspects of islet protection."

                "abstract": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular links between PD and diabetes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy in dopaminergic (DA) cells under high-glucose (HG) conditions. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, TXNIP was upregulated and autophagy was inhibited in the midbrain, while the loss of DA neurons was accelerated by hyperglycemia. In cultured PC12 cells under HG, TXNIP expression was upregulated and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased, leading to cell death. Autophagic flux was further blocked and PINK1 expression was decreased under HG conditions. Parkin expression in the mitochondrial fraction and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP)-induced co-localization of COX IV (marker for mitochondria) and LAMP1 (marker for lysosomes) were also significantly decreased by HG. Overexpression of TXNIP was sufficient to decrease the expression of both PINK1 and Parkin in PC12 cells, while knockdown of the expression of TXNIP by siRNA decreased intracellular ROS and attenuated cellular injury under HG. Moreover, inhibition of TXNIP improved the CCCP-induced co-localization of COX IV and LAMP1 in PC12 cells under HG. Together, these results suggest that TXNIP regulates Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy under HG conditions, and targeting TXNIP may be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing the risk of PD under hyperglycemic conditions."

                "abstract": "Deregulation of mitochondrial functions in hepatocytes contributes to many liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Lately, it was referred to as MAFLD (metabolism-associated fatty liver disease). Hesperetin (Hst), a bioactive flavonoid constituent of citrus fruit, has been proven to attenuate NAFLD. However, a potential connection between its preventive activities and the modulation of mitochondrial functions remains unclear. Here, our results showed that Hst alleviates palmitic acid (PA)-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell death by inhibition of mitochondrial impairment in HepG2 cells. Hst reinstates fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rates measured by seahorse extracellular flux analyzer and intracellular acetyl-CoA levels as well as intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites levels including NADH and FADH2 reduced by PA exposure. In addition, Hst protects HepG2 cells against PA-induced abnormal energetic profile, ATP generation reduction, overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, Hst improves the protein expression involved in PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Our results demonstrate that it restores PA-impaired mitochondrial function and sustains cellular homeostasis due to the elevation of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and the subsequent disposal of dysfunctional mitochondria. These results provide therapeutic potential for Hst utilization as an effective intervention against fatty liver disease."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Scutellarin (Scu) is one of the main active ingredients of Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.) Hand.-Mazz which has been used to treat cardiovascular disease including vascular dysfunction caused by diabetes. Scu also has a protective effect on vascular endothelial cells against hyperglycemia. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Scu on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) injury induced by high glucose (HG), especially the regulation of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HUVECs were exposed to HG to induce vascular endothelial cells injury in vitro. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. The extent of cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst staining and flow cytometry. Mitophagy was assayed by fluorescent immunostaining, transmission electron microscope and immunoblot. Besides, virtual docking was conducted to validate the interaction of PINK1 protein and Scu. RESULTS: We found that Scu significantly increased cell viability in HG-treated HUVECs. Scu reduces the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and cytochrome C (Cyt.c) to inhibit apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway. Meanwhile, Scu improved the overload of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and SOD2 protein expression, and reversed the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Besides, Scu increased autophagic flux, improved the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 \u2161 (LC3 II), Beclin 1 and autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg 5) and decreased the expression of Sequestosome1/P62 in HG-treated HUVECs. Furthermore, Scu improved the expressions of PINK1, Parkin, and Mitofusin2, which revealed the enhancement of mitophagy. Moreover, the beneficial effects of Scu on HG-induced low expression of Parkin, overproduction of ROS, and over expressions of P62, Cyt.c and Cleaved caspase-3 were weakened by PINK1 gene knockdown. Molecular docking suggested good interaction of Scu and PINK1 protein. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Scu may protect vascular endothelial cells against hyperglycemia-induced injury by up-regulating mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin signal pathway."

                "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN), the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is often accompanied by dyslipidemia, which is closely related to the occurrence and development of DN and even the progression to ESRD. Mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy, is a crucial mitochondrial quality control mechanism, and largely regulated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1)/Parkin signaling pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated that PA induced mitochondrial damage and excessive mitoROS generation in podocytes. We also found PA treatment resulted in the activation of mitophagy by increasing co-localization of GFP-LC3 with mitochondria and enhancing the formation of mitophagosome, stabilization of PINK1 and mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, which indicated that PINK1/Parkin pathway was involved in PA-induced mitophagy in podocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of mitophagy by silencing Parkin dramatically aggravated PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, mitoROS production, and further enhanced PA-induced apoptosis of podocytes. Finally, we showed that PINK1/Parkin pathway were up-regulated in kidney of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Taken together, our results suggest that PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy plays a protective role in PA-induced podocytes apoptosis through reducing mitochondrial ROS production and that enhancing mitophagy provides a potential therapeutic strategy for kidney diseases with hyperlipidemia, such as DN."

                "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetic osteoporosis (T2DOP), which seriously threatens elderly people's health, is rapidly increasing in recent years. However, the specific mechanism of the T2DOP is still unclear. Studies have shown the relationship between iron overload and T2DOP. Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) is a protein that stores iron ions and intercepts toxic ferrous ions in cells mitochondria. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell injured way, may be related to the pathogenesis of T2DOP. In this study, we intend to elucidate the effect of FtMt on ferroptosis in osteoblasts and explain the possible mechanism. We first detected the occurrence of ferroptosis in bone tissue and the expression of FtMt after inducing T2DOP rat model. Then we used hFOB1.19 cells to study the influence of high glucose on FtMt, ferroptosis, and osteogenic function of osteoblasts. Then we observed the effect of FtMt on ferroptosis and osteoblast function by lentiviral silencing and overexpression of FtMt. We found ferroptosis in T2DOP rats bone. Overexpression of FtMt reduced osteoblastic ferroptosis under high glucose condition while silent FtMt induced mitophagy through ROS / PINK1/Parkin pathway. Then we found increased ferroptosis in osteoblasts after activating mitophagy by carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl-hydrazine (CCCP, a mitophagy agonist). Our study demonstrated that FtMt inhibited the occurrence of ferroptosis in osteoblasts by reducing oxidative stress caused by excess ferrous ions, and FtMt deficiency induced mitophagy in the pathogenesis of T2DOP. This study suggested that FtMt might serve as a potential target for T2DOP therapy."

                "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common diabetic complication. Studies show that mitophagy inhibition induced-ferroptosis plays a crucial role in DN progression. UHRF1 is associated with mitophagy and is highly expression in DN patients, however, the effect of UHRF1 on DN is still unclear. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether UHRF1 involves DN development by the mitophagy/ferroptosis pathway. We overexpressed UHRF1 using an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) system in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Renal function index, pathological changes, mitophagy factors, and ferroptosis factors were detected in vivo. High-glucose cultured human renal proximal tubular (HK-2) cells were used as in vitro models to investigate the mechanism of UHRF1 in DN. We found that diabetic mice exhibited kidney damage, which was alleviated by UHRF1 overexpression. UHRF1 overexpression promoted PINK1-mediated mitophagy and inhibited the expression of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), a factor associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, UHRF1 overexpression alleviated lipid peroxidation and free iron accumulation, and upregulated the expression of GPX4 and Slc7a11, indicating the inhibition effect of UHRF1 overexpression on ferroptosis. We further investigated the mechanism of UHRF1 in the mitophagy/ferroptosis pathway in DN. We found that UHRF1 overexpression promoted PINK1-mediated mitophagy via inhibiting TXNIP expression, thus suppressing ferroptosis. These findings confirmed that upregulation of UHRF1 expression alleviates DN, indicating that UHRF1 has a reno-protective effect against DN."

                "abstract": "Functional loss of endothelial cells will lead to development and progression of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. However, dysfunction of endothelial cells in diabetes has yet to be fully understood. We aimed to characterize the potential effects of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, on preventing high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction and excessive mitophagic response. Pretreatment with liraglutide prevented downregulation of eNOS phosphorylation and NO secretion, and reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to high glucose. We further demonstrated that liraglutide likely mediated such protective effects by reducing PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. Liraglutide markedly decreased high glucose-induced mitochondrial ROS, lessened PINK1 expression and mitochondrial accumulation of Parkin, but recovered SIRT1 expression. Seahorse analysis revealed that liraglutide mitigated high glucose-induced reduction of basal and maximum respiration rates as well as spare respiration capacity. Inhibition of Parkin by RNA silencing not only resulted in increased mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS and reduced mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential, but also led to increased apoptotic responses in high glucose treated HUVECs which were not preventable by liraglutide. Together, our study reveals that liraglutide acts upstream of the PINK1/Parkin pathway to effectively counteract high glucose induced cell dysfunction by suppression of the PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Therefore, its use as an adjunct therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus is warranted to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. Further research is required to examine the exact molecules, including SIRT1, upstream of the PINK1/parkin pathway that liraglutide targets to maintain the mitochondrial homeostasis."

                "abstract": "Palmitic acid (PA)-induced myocardial injury is considered a critical contributor to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related cardiomyopathy. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that PA induced the cell death of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while different ferroptosis inhibitors significantly abrogated the cell death of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exposed to PA. Mechanistically, PA decreased the protein expression levels of both heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which were restored by different ferroptosis inhibitors. Overexpression of HSF1 not only alleviated PA-induced cell death and lipid peroxidation but also improved disturbed iron homeostasis by regulating the transcription of iron metabolism-related genes (e.g., Fth1, Tfrc, Slc40a1). Additionally, PA-blocked GPX4 protein expression was evidently restored by HSF1 overexpression. Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress rather than autophagy contributed to HSF1-mediated GPX4 expression. Moreover, GPX4 overexpression protected against PA-induced ferroptosis, whereas knockdown of GPX4 reversed the anti-ferroptotic effect of HSF1. Consistent with the in vitro findings, PA-challenged Hsf1-/- mice exhibited more serious ferroptosis, increased Slc40a1 and Fth1 mRNA expression, decreased GPX4 and TFRC expression and enhanced ER stress in the heart compared with Hsf1+/+ mice. Altogether, HSF1 may function as a key defender against PA-induced ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes by maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and GPX4 expression."

We report here three important questions yet unclarified in the previous study; 1) Whether enhanced fission of mitochondria by the treatment of silibinin leads to mitophagy, 2) Whether mitophagy positively contributes to apoptosis and 3) Whether estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7\u00a0cells and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells are affected in a different way by silibinin treatment, since silibinin often works through ERs signaling pathway. Mitophagy driven by Pink1/Parkin signaling, plays an important role in eliminating damaged mitochondria. Indeed, increased expression of Pink1 and the recruitment of Parkin and LC3-II to mitochondria by the treatment with silibinin account for silibinin induction of mitophagy. In this study, the effects of mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1) and small interfering RNA targeting dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) were examined to reveal the effect of mitochondrial fission on mitophagy. As expected, mdivi-1 or siRNA targeting DRP1 reversed silibinin-induced mitochondrial fission due to down-regulation in the expression of DRP1. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission by mdivi-1 prevented induction of mitophagy as well as autophagy in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells, indicating that silibinin-induced mitochondrial fission leads to mitophagy. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission efficiently prevented silibinin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells in our previous work, and the second point of the present study, inhibition of mitophagy by Pink1 or Parkin knockdown increased silibinin-induced apoptosis of these cells, respectively, suggesting that the mitophagy induced by silibinin treatment serves as a cytoprotective effect, resulting in reduction of apoptosis of cancer cells in both cells. In the third point, we studied whether estrogen receptors (ERs) played a role in silibinin-induced mitophagy and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells. ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are not involved in silibinin-induced mitophagic process in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells. These findings demonstrated that silibinin induced mitochondria fission leads to mitophagy, which attenuates silibinin-induced apoptosis not through ERs-Pink1 or -Parkin pathway in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231."

An accumulating body of evidence has shown that the estrogen receptors are key molecules involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results suggest that silibinin upregulates ER\u03b1 signaling pathway from the finding that ER\u03b1-specific inhibitors abolish the anti-lipotoxic effect of silibinin.

                "abstract": "Oxidative stress and mitochondrial\u00a0dysfunction are involved in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced neuronal apoptosis. Mitophagy is the main method to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria. Apelin-36, a type of neuropeptide, has been reported to exert protective effects in cerebral I/R (I/R) injury, but its precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To study the effects of Apelin-36 on oxidative stress and mitochondrial\u00a0dysfunction in cerebral I/R injury, the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model with 6\u00a0h of ischemia and 6\u00a0h of reperfusion was established in HT22 cells. Results demonstrated that Apelin-36 protected against OGD/R injury by improving cell viability, decreasing the apoptotic cells ratio and increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition, Apelin-36 treatment inhibited oxidative stress by downregulating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). And Apelin-36 also activated the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Mitochondrial apoptosis was also alleviated with Apelin-36 treatment detected by the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the expression of Cytochrome c (Cyt c), Cleaved caspase-9, and Cleaved caspase-3. Furthermore, the SIRT1-mediated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy was activated by Apelin-36 treatment with the downregulation of p62 and upregulation of LC3B-II and Beclin1. Both EX527 and Cyclosporine A (CsA), which are inhibitors of SIRT1 and mitophagy, markedly alleviated the inhibition of oxidative stress and mitochondrial\u00a0dysfunction caused by Apelin-36. These findings suggest that SIRT1-mediated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy is involved in the neuroprotective effects of Apelin-36 on OGD/R-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial\u00a0dysfunction."

MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that exerts protective effects in diabetic mice, but the mechanism underlying these effects is not clear. We demonstrated that mitochondrial abnormalities, such as defective mitophagy, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) overexpression and mitochondrial fragmentation, occurred in the tubular cells of db/db mice, accompanied by reduced PINK and Parkin expression and increased apoptosis. These changes were partially reversed following an intraperitoneal injection of mitoQ. High glucose (HG) also induces deficient mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in HK-2 cells, changes that were reversed by mitoQ. Moreover, mitoQ restored the expression, activity and translocation of HG-induced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and inhibited the expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1), as well as the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1. The reduced PINK and Parkin expression noted in HK-2 cells subjected to HG exposure was partially restored by mitoQ. This effect was abolished by Nrf2 siRNA and augmented by Keap1 siRNA. Transfection with Nrf2 siRNA or PINK siRNA in HK-2 cells exposed to HG conditions partially blocked the effects of mitoQ on mitophagy and tubular damage. These results suggest that mitoQ exerts beneficial effects on tubular injury in DKD via mitophagy and that mitochondrial quality control is mediated by Nrf2/PINK."

                "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a serious complication during the treatment of stroke patients with very few effective clinical treatment. Hydrogen (H2) can protect mitochondria function and have favorable therapeutic effects on cerebral IRI. Mitophagy plays an important role in eliminating damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria and maintaining mitochondria homeostasis. However, whether the protection of H2 on cerebral IRI is via regulating mitophagy is still unknown. In this study, OGD/R damaged hippocampal neurons were used to mimic cerebral IRI in vivo and we detected the effect of H2, Rap (autophagy activator) and 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) on OGD/R neurons. The results of MTT indicated that H2 and RAP could increase cell viability after OGD/R treatment, while 3-MA further aggravated injury and inhibited the protection of H2 and RAP. Furthermore, the intracellular ROS and apoptosis ratio were determined, the results showed that ROS and apoptosis level significantly increased after OGD/R, H2 and RAP effectively restrained the increment of ROS level and apoptosis ratio but their protective effect can be weakened by 3-MA. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitophagy level were also determined, the data showed that H2 and RAP protected against the loss of MPP and increased the co-localization of mitochondria with GFP-LC3 while 3-MA exerted antagonistic effect. At last, the mitophagy-related factors LC3, PINK1 and Parkin expression were detected and analyzed. We found that the expression of LC3 was increased after OGD/R which can be further enhanced by H2 and RAP treatment, but treatment with 3-MA was opposite. The result revealed H2 and RAP could activate mitophagy while 3-MA inhibit mitophagy. In addition, the study found H2 and RAP could significantly induce the expression of PINK1 and Parkin in OGD/R neurons which was inhibited by 3-MA. Taken together, our findings demonstrated H2 had a neuroprotective effect on OGD/R damaged neurons by protecting mitochondrial function and the potential protection mechanism may closely related to enhancement of mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway."

Many studies have also shown that oxidative stress can stimulate the production of a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have various adverse effects on mitochondria and can damage muscle cells. PURPOSE: In this study, based on our previous research, we focused on the PINK1/Parkin pathway to explore the mechanism by which AS-IV alleviates muscle injury by inhibiting excessive mitophagy. METHODS: L6 myoblasts were treated with AS-IV after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Then, we detected the related indices of oxidative stress and mitophagy by different methods. A PINK1 knockdown cell line was established by lentiviral infection to obtain further evidence that AS-IV reduces mitochondrial damage through PINK1/Parkin. RESULTS: After mitochondrial damage, the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular ROS in L6 myoblasts significantly increased, while the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ATP decreased. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Tom20 and Tim23 were decreased, while those of VDAC1 were increased. PINK1, Parkin, and LC3 II mRNA and protein expression increased, and P62 mRNA and protein expression decreased\u00b7H2O2 combined with CCCP strongly activated the mitophagy pathway and impaired mitochondrial function. However, abnormal expression of these factors could be reversed after treatment with AS-IV, and excessive mitochondrial autophagy could also be reversed, thus restoring the regulatory function of mitochondria. However, AS-IV-adjusted function was resisted after PINK1 knockdown. CONCLUSION: AS-IV is a potential drug for myasthenia gravis (MG), and its treatment mechanism is related to mediating mitophagy and restoring mitochondrial function through the PINK1/Parkin pathway."

                "abstract": "Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation causes skin damages. In this study, we focus on the involvement of mitochondrial disorders in UVB injury. Surprisingly, UVB irradiation increases the amounts of mitochondria in human immortalized keratinocytes HaCaT. However, further analysis shows that ATP levels decreased by UVB treatment in accordance with the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), suggesting an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Mitophagy, mainly mediated by PINK1 and parkin, is critical for the elimination of damaged mitochondria. Western blot results show that the levels of both PINK1 and parkin are decreased in UVB-irradiated cells, indicating the impairment of mitophagy. Silencing the expression of PINK1 or parkin by transfection of siRNA shows essentially the same damage to the cells as UVB irradiation does, including increased mitochondrial amount, decreased MMP and ATP production, and enhanced apoptosis, evidencing that repression of PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy plays a primary cause of UVB-caused cells damages. We previously found that HaCaT cells exposed to UVB showed activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and apoptosis. Here, silencing PINK1 or parkin also increases the protein levels of cGAS and STING, facilitates nuclear accumulation of NF-\u03baB, and promotes the transcription of IFN\u03b2, suggesting for the activation of STING pathway. Mitophagy impairment either by UVB-irradiation or by PINK1/parkin silencing initiates caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, as shown by the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP, as well as the increase of Hoechst-positive stained cells and Annexin V-positive cells. Further studies find that Bax-mediated permeabilization of mitochondrial membrane is critical for cell apoptosis, as well as the cytosolic leakage of mtDNA in UVB-treated cells, which results in cGAS-STING activation, and these processes are negatively-regulated by PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy. This study reveals the involvement of dysfunctional mitochondria due to impaired mitophagy in the damaging effect of UVB irradiation on HaCaT cells. Restoring the mitophagy has the potential to be developed as a new strategy to protect skin from UVB damages."

This study aimed to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of Sirt3 on mitophagy in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in a high glucose environment. The expression levels of Sirt3, Foxo3a, PINK1, Parkin and LC3B in RPE subjected to high-glucose (HG, 30\u00a0mM D-glucose) conditions were detected by RT-PCR and western blotting. Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining was used to detect the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RPE treated with HG. MitoTracker and LysoTracker probes were used to label mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively, to observe the occurrence of autophagy. Sirt3-dependent regulation of mitophagy through the Foxo3a/PINK1-Parkin pathway was further investigated by virus transfection-mediated Sirt3 overexpression and PINK1 silencing. The effect of Sirt3 overexpression on apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The Sirt3 expression was decreased, the Foxo3a/PINK1-Parkin pathway was inhibited, intracellular ROS level was increased, and mitophagy was attenuated in RPE under HG condition. Sirt3 overexpression activated the Foxo3a/PINK1-Parkin signaling pathway and mitophagy, and inhibited cell apoptosis. Silencing PINK1 inhibited the effect of Sirt3 overexpression on mitophagy. In summary, Sirt3 can activate mitophagy through the Foxo3a/PINK1-Parkin pathway and reduce HG-induced apoptosis of RPE. This study provides a new direction to understand the pathogenesis and develop a potential therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy."

                "abstract": "With the increasing application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in biological materials, the neurotoxicity caused by these particles has raised serious concerns. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the toxic effect of ZnO NPs on brain cells remain unclear. Mitochondrial damage has been reported to be a factor in the toxicity of ZnO NPs. PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy is a newly emerging additional function of autophagy that selectively degrades impaired mitochondria. Here, a PINK1 gene knockdown BV-2 cell model was established to determine whether PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy was involved in ZnO NP-induced toxicity in BV-2 cells. The expression of total parkin, mito-parkin, cyto-parkin, and PINK1 both in wild type and PINK1-/- BV-2 cells was evaluated using Western blot analysis after the cells were exposed to 10 \u03bcg/mL of 50 nm ZnO NPs for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. The findings suggested that the downregulation of PINK1 resulted in a significant reduction in the survival rate after ZnO NP exposure compared with that of control cells. ZnO NPs were found to induce the transportation of parkin from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria, implying the involvement of mitophagy in ZnO NP-induced toxicity. The deletion of the PINK1 gene inhibited the recruitment of parkin to the mitochondria, causing failure of the cell to trigger mitophagy. The present study demonstrated that apart from autophagy, PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy plays a protective role in ZnO NP-induced cytotoxicity."

                "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, is caused by lipid peroxidation. Noteworthily, accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation are found in the proximity of the neuritic plaque, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the relationship between ferroptosis and neuroinflammation in AD is unclear. Silibinin, extracted from the Silybum marianum, is possibly developed as an agent for AD treatment from its neuroprotective effect, but the effect of silibinin on sporadic AD that accounts for more than 95% of AD remains unclear. To determine whether silibinin alleviates the pathogenesis of sporadic AD and investigate the underlying mechanisms, STZ-treated HT22 murine hippocampal neurons and intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rats, a sporadic AD model, were used in this study. Results show that silibinin not only promotes survival of STZ-treated HT22\u00a0cells, but also ameliorates the cognitive impairment and anxiety/depression-like behavior of ICV-STZ rats. We here demonstrate that silibinin evidently inhibits the protein level of p53 as well as upregulates the protein level of cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 and ferroptosis inhibitor GPX4, but not p21, leading to the protection against STZ-induced ferroptotic damage. Immunofluorescent staining also shows that accumulation of lipid peroxidation induced by ferroptotic damage leads to increased fluorescence of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), a maker of oxidized DNA. The oxidized DNA then leaks to the cytoplasm and upregulates the expression of the stimulator of interferon gene (STING), which triggers the production of IFN-\u03b2 and other inflammatory cascades including NF-\u03baB/TNF\u03b1 and NLRP3/caspase 1/IL-1\u03b2. However, the treatment with silibinin blocks the above pathological changes. Moreover, in HT22\u00a0cells with/without STZ treatment, GPX4-knockdown increases the protein level of STING, indicating that the ferroptotic damage leads to the activation of STING signaling pathway. These results imply that silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect on an STZ-induced sporadic AD model by downregulating ferroptotic damage and thus the downstream STING-mediated neuroinflammation."

            "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in intercellular communication, and the function of EVs mainly depends on the state of source cells. To determine the effect of diabetic microenvironment on EVs secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), this work explores the effect of normal glucose (5.5\u00a0mm) cultured BMSCs derived EVs (NG-EVs) and high glucose (30\u00a0mm) cultured BMSCs derived EVs (HG-EVs) in regulating the migration, proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. In order to improve the bioavailability of EVs, this work constructs a sustained release system of polydopamine (PDA) functionalized 3D printing gelatin/hyaluronic acid/nano-hydroxyapatite (Gel/HA/nHAP) scaffolds (S/PDA) and verifies its function in the calvarial defect model of diabetic rats. This work confirms that both NG-EVs and HG-EVs can promote proliferation and migration, inhibit apoptosis and promote osteogenic differentiation, but the function of HG-EVs is weaker than that of NG-EVs. Therefore, EVs secreted by autologous cells of diabetic patients are not suitable for self-repair. This work hopes that the 3D printing scaffold designed for sustained-release EVs will provide a new strategy for acellular tissue engineering bone repair in diabetic patients."

                "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of concentrated growth factors (CGF) and bone substitutes on the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), as well as the development of a novel 3D-printed biomimetic bone scaffold. Based on the structure of cancellous bone, 3D-printed bionic bone with sustainable release of growth factors and Ca2+ was prepared. Using BMSCs and EA.hy926 in co-culture with the bionic bone scaffold, experimental results demonstrate that this bionic structural design enhances cell proliferation and adhesion, and that the bionic bone possesses the ability to promote bone and vascular regeneration directly. Transcriptomics, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry are employed to investigate the effects of CGF and Ca2+ on the signaling pathways of BMSCs. The study reports that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) released by CGF activated VEGFR2 on BMSCs, leading to Ca2+ influx and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby influencing osteogenesis. Animal experiments confirm the ability of the bionic bone to promote osteogenesis in vivo, and its unique degradation pattern accelerates the in vivo repair of bone defects. In conclusion, this study presents a novel biomimetic strategy and, for the first time, explores the potential mechanism by which VEGF and Ca2+ regulate BMSCs differentiation through the VEGFR2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These insights offer a new perspective for the development of innovative bone substitute materials."

                "abstract": "Senescent mandibular bone repair poses a formidable challenge without a completely satisfactory strategy. Endogenous cell recruitment and osteogenic differentiation are two sequential stages in bone regeneration, and disruptions in these two processes present significant obstacles to senescent bone repair. To address these issues, engineered extracellular vesicles (EV) with sequential stem cell recruitment and osteogenic functions were developed. This study demonstrated that Apt19s-engineered extracellular vesicles (Apt19s-EV) recognize and recruit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived from old rats (O-BMSCs) specifically and effectively. MiR-376b-5p, identified by RNA sequencing and transfection, was significantly decreased in O-BMSCs, and it was selected to construct miR-376b-5p-engineered extracellular vesicles (376b-EV). 376b-EV could promote osteogenesis and alleviate senescence of O-BMSCs by targeting Camsap1. To combine the advantages of Apt19s and miR-376b-5p, dual engineered extracellular vesicles (Apt-376b-EV) comprising both Apt19s and miR-376b-5p modifications were constructed. To further validate its function, Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel was used as a carrier to construct the Apt-376b-EV@GelMA delivery system. The in vitro results have demonstrated that Apt-376b-EV@GelMA could recruit O-BMSCs, alleviate senescence and promote osteogenic differentiation sequentially. Notably, the in vivo study also showed that Apt-376b-EV@GelMA could sequentially recruit endogenous stem cells and enhance new bone formation in senescent bone fracture and critical-sized defect models. In summary, the dual engineered extracellular vesicles, Apt-376b-EV, offer an appealing solution for recruiting endogenous stem cells and promoting bone repair sequentially in the senescent microenvironment, which may broaden the clinical applications of engineered EV and provide valuable strategies for treating senescent bone-related diseases in the future clinical work."

                "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic musculoskeletal disease characterized by joint inflammation and progressive degeneration of articular cartilage. Currently a definitive cure for OA remains to be a challenge due to the very low self-repair capacity of cartilage, thus development of more effective therapies is needed for cartilage repair. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have shown great potential as therapeutic agents for stimulating regeneration of articular cartilage. However, a standardized protocol is still lacking for manufacturing of highly active EVs for clinical applications. This study aimed to investigate the efficient production of highly active EVs by 3-dimensional (3D) MSC culture, verify the reparative efficacy of EVs on cartilage defect and elucidate the repair mechanisms. Umbilical cord MSCs were embedded in alginate to form MSC spheroids for 3D culture in human platelet lysate (hPL)-containing medium, which produced 3D culture-derived EVs (3D-EVs) with a significantly improved yield. The 3D-EVs expressed higher level of VEGF, and appeared superior to two-dimensional (2D) monolayer MSC culture-derived EVs (2D-EVs) to improve migration and proliferation in MSCs and inflammatory chondrocytes, and to suppress expression of cartilage-degrading factors. Importantly, the 3D-EVs and sodium alginate (SA)-hyaluronic acid (HA) composite hydrogel (3D-EVs/SA-HA) demonstrated significantly improved therapeutic efficacy than 2D-EVs/SA-HA hydrogel for repair of cartilage defectin vivo. The underlying mechanisms are associated with the concomitant upregulation of type II collagen and cartilage synthesis and downregulation of MMP13 in cartilage tissues. Collectively, these data showed that highly active MSC EVs could be efficiently manufactured by 3D cell culture with hPL-containing medium, and these EVs were superior to 2D-EVs for the repair of articular cartilage defect."

                "abstract": "Background: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from stem cells demonstrate significant potential in bone regeneration. Adipose tissue is regarded as a stem cell reservoir with abundant reserves and easy accessibility. Compared to adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) possess similar stem cell characteristics but exhibit greater proliferative capacity, higher homogeneity, and an enhanced osteogenic differentiation potential. This study is the first to examine the effect of DFATs-derived EVs on bone regeneration and elucidate their potential mechanisms of action. Methods: Primary DFATs were cultured using the \"ceiling culture\" method and EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized. Experiments were performed to assess the impact of the EVs on the proliferation, migration, and osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Subsequently, high-throughput miRNA sequencing was conducted on the EVs derived from DFATs that had undergone 0 days (0d-EVs) and 14 days (14d-EVs) of osteogenic differentiation. Results: The results indicated that the EVs derived from DFATs which experienced 14 days of osteogenic induction significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. High-throughput sequencing results revealed that up-regulated miRNAs in the 14d-EVs were primarily involved in biological processes such as the Notch signaling pathway and the positive regulation of cell movement and migration. The target genes of these differently expressed miRNAs were enriched in osteogenesis-related signaling pathways. Conclusion: This study innovatively demonstrated that conditioned EVs (14d-EVs) derived from DFATs promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via miRNAs, offering a promising cell-free therapeutic option for bone defect."

                "abstract": "The current clinical applications of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are limited to only a few specific indications. Locally controlled delivery of combinations of growth factors can be a promising strategy to improve BMP-based bone repair. However, the success of this approach requires the development of an effective release system and the correct choice of growth factors capable of enhancing BMP activity. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, also known as FGF-2) has shown promise in promoting bone repair, although conflicting results have been reported. Considering the complex biological activities of FGF-2, we hypothesized that FGF-2 can promote BMP-induced bone regeneration only if the dosage and kinetic parameters of the two factors are individually tailored. In this study, we conducted systematic in vitro studies on cell proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization in response to factor dose, delivery mode (sequential or simultaneous), and release rate. Subsequently, we designed individually controlled BMP-7 and FGF-2 release poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanospheres attached to the poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibrous scaffolds. The data showed that BMP-7-induced bone formation was accelerated by a relatively higher FGF-2 dose (100 ng/scaffold) delivered at a faster release rate, or by a relatively lower FGF-2 dose (10 ng/scaffold) at a slower release rate in an in vivo bone regeneration model. In contrast, a very high dose of FGF-2 (1000 ng/scaffold) inhibited bone regeneration under all conditions. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that FGF-2 improved BMP-7-induced bone regeneration by coordinating FGF-2 dosage and release kinetics to enhance stem cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are the most potent growth/differentiation factors in bone development and regeneration. However, the clinical applications of BMPs have been limited to only a few specific indications due to the required supraphysiological dosages with the current BMP products and their side effects. Locally controlled delivery of BMPs and additional growth factors that can enhance their osteogenic potency are highly desired. However, different growth factors act with different mechanisms. Here we report a nanofibrous scaffold that mimics collagen in size and geometry and is immobilized with biodegradable nanospheres to achieve local and distinct release profiles of BMP7 and FGF2. Systematic studies demonstrated low dose BMP7 and FGF2 with different temporal release profiles can optimally enhance bone regeneration."

                "abstract": "Metal 3D printing is increasingly being used to manufacture titanium-aluminum-vanadium (Ti6Al4V) implants. In vitro studies using 2D substrates demonstrate that the osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) on Ti6Al4V surfaces, with a microscale/nanoscale surface topography that mimics an osteoclast resorption pit, involves non-canonical Wnt signaling; Wnt3a is downregulated and Wnt5a is upregulated, leading to the local production of BMP2 and semaphorin 3A (sema3A). In this study, it was examined whether the regulation of MSCs in a 3D environment occurs by a similar mechanism. Human MSCs from two different donors were cultured for 7, 14, or 21 days on porous (3D) or solid (2D) constructs fabricated by powder-bed laser fusion. mRNA and secretion of osteoblast markers, as well as factors that enhance peri-implant osteogenesis, were analyzed, with a primary focus on the Wnt family, sema3A, and microRNA-145 (miR-145) signaling pathways. MSCs exhibited greater production of osteocalcin, latent and active TGF\u03b21, sema3A, and Wnt16 on the 3D constructs compared to 2D, both of which had similar microscale/nanoscale surface modifications. Wnt3a was reduced on 2D constructs as a function of time; Wnt11 and Wnt5a remained elevated in the 3D and 2D cultures. To better understand the role of Wnt16, cultures were treated with rhWnt16; endogenous Wnt16 was blocked using an antibody. Wnt16 promoted proliferation and inhibited osteoblast differentiation, potentially by reducing production of BMP2 and BMP4. Wnt16 expression was reduced by exogenous Wnt16 in 3D cells. Addition of the anti-Wnt16 antibody to the cultures reversed the effects of exogenous Wnt16, indicating an autocrine mechanism. Wnt16 increased miR-145-5p, suggesting a potential feedback mechanism. The miR-145-5p mimic increased Wnt16 production and inhibited sema3A in a 3D porous substrate-specific manner. Wnt16 did not affect sema3A production, but it was reduced by miR-145-5p mimic on the 3D constructs and stimulated by miR-145-5p inhibitor. Media from 7-, 14-, and 21-day cultures of MSCs grown on 3D constructs inhibited osteoclast activity to a greater extent than media from the 2D cultures. The findings present a significant step towards understanding the complex molecular interplay that occurs in 3D Ti6Al4V constructs fabricated by additive manufacturing. In addition to enhancing osteogenesis, the 3D porous biomimetic structure inhibits osteoclast activities, indicating its role in modulating bone remodeling processes. Our data suggest that the pathway mediated by sema3A/Wnt16/miR145-5p was enhanced by the 3D surface and contributes to bone regeneration in the 3D implants. This comprehensive exploration contributes valuable insights to guide future strategies in implant design, customization, and ultimately aims at improving clinical outcomes and successful osseointegration."

Advancements in three-dimensional (3D) printing technology have propelled the development of several engineering disciplines, such as tissue engineering. Nevertheless, 3D-printed frameworks with conventional materials often lack multifunctional capabilities to promote specific activities for diverse regeneration purposes. In this study, we developed a highly oxidized two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (Ox-gCN) as a nano-photocatalyst to reinforce alginate/gelatin (ALG)-based hydrogel scaffolds (ALG/CN) to achieve an anti-inflammatory and osteo-immunomodulatory niche with superior hemostatic ability for traumatic bone injury repair. Sulfuric acid oxidation enhances the oxygen-containing functional groups of the g-CN surface and promotes cell adhesion and differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in vitro. Moreover, the excellent visible light-activated photocatalytic characteristics of the ALG/CN scaffold were used in antibacterial studies. In addition, the ALG/CN bio/nanocomposite scaffold facilitates M2 polarization of macrophages than did pristine ALG scaffolds. Furthermore, ALG/CN scaffold induced hBMSCs differentiation by upregulating ERK and MAPKs phosphorylation during osteo-immunomodulation. In a rat calvaria defect model, the fabricated ALG/CN scaffolds induced new bone formation through collagen deposition and activation of osteocalcin proteins without inflammation in vivo. These results highlight the potential of 3D-printed functionalized 2D carbon nitrides in regulating the bone immune microenvironment, which may be beneficial for developing advanced tissue constructs, especially for traumatic bone regeneration in clinical settings."

Strategies to safely and efficiently improve the bone regeneration disorder caused by blood glucose fluctuation are still a challenge. Neutral sphingophospholipase 2 (Smpd3) is downregulated in jawbone-derived bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from T2DM patients. Here, we investigated the effect of Smpd3 on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and utilized exosomes from stem cells overexpressing Smpd3 as the main treatment based on the glucose responsiveness of phenylboronic acid-based polyvinyl alcohol crosslinkers and the protease degradability of gelatin nanoparticles. The combined loading of Smpd3-overexpressing stem cell-derived exosomes (Exos-Smpd3) and nanosilver ions (Ns) to construct a hydrogel delivery system (Exos-Smpd3@Ns) promoted osteogenesis and differentiation of BMSCs in a glucose-fluctuating environment, ectopic osteogenesis of BMSCs in a glucose-fluctuating environment and jawbone regeneration of diabetic dogs in vitro. Mechanistically, Smpd3 promoted the osteogenesis and differentiation of jawbone-derived BMSCs by activating autophagy in the jawbone and inhibiting macrophage polarization and oxidative stress caused by blood glucose fluctuations. These results reveal the role and mechanism of Smpd3 and the Smpd3 overexpression exosome delivery system in promoting BMSC function and bone regeneration under blood glucose fluctuations, providing a theoretical basis and candidate methods for the treatment of bone defects in T2DM patients."

Factors such as donor site morbidity from autologous transplantation, slow recovery of long-distance nerve damage, and deficiencies in local cytokines and extracellular matrix contribute to the complexity of effective PNI treatment. It is extremely urgent to develop functional nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) as substitutes for nerve autografts. We fabricate an aligned topological scaffold by combining the E-jet 3D printing and electrospinning to exert synergistic topographical cue for peripheral nerve regeneration. To address the limitation of NGCs with hollow lumens in repairing long-distance nerve defects, we modified the internal microenvironment by filling the lumen with umbilical cord-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels and extracellular vesicles (EVs). This approach led to the development of a functional HE-NGC. Herein, the HE-NGCs provided obvious guidance and proliferation to SCs and PC12 in vitro due to the sustained-release effect of dECM hydrogels and the outstanding proliferation-promoting role of EVs. The HE-NGCs was surgically implanted in vivo to bridge 12-mm gap sciatic nerve defect in rats and it had a satisfactory effect in reestablishment of the sciatic nerve, including the recovery of motor functions and the myelination. Further studies revealed that HE-NGCs might promoted axon growth by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathways. These findings indicate that HE-NGCs effectively promote nerve regeneration, offering a promising strategy for applications in peripheral nerve repair.

By leveraging the natural extracellular matrix (ECM), we significantly enhanced the efficacy and longevity of EVs encapsulated within a dECM hydrogel. Our provided strategy involves utilizing EVs to support nerve cell migration and proliferation along aligned NGCs. As the dECM hydrogel degrades, EVs are gradually released, facilitating the deposition of new ECM and enabling the repair of nerve defects up to 12-mm in length."

Combined use of three-dimensional (3D)-printed scaffolds and bioactive factors is an emerging strategy for the treatment of bone defects. Scaffolds can be printed using 3D cryogenic printing technology to create a microarchitecture similar to trabecular bone. Melatonin (MT) has attracted attention in recent years as an excellent factor for promoting cell viability and tissue repair. In this study, porous scaffolds were prepared by cryogenic printing with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and ultralong hydroxyapatite nanowires. The hierarchical pore size distribution of the scaffolds was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Sleep-inspired small extracellular vesicles (MT-sEVs) were then obtained from MT-stimulated cells and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol)-inorganic pyrophosphate (DSPE-PEG-PPi) was used to modify the membrane of MT-sEVs to obtain PPi-MT-sEVs. RNA sequencing was performed to explore the potential mechanisms. The results demonstrated that PPi-MT-sEVs not only enhanced cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis, but also regulated the osteogenic/adipogenic fate determination and M1/M2 macrophage polarization switch in vitro. PPi-MT-sEVs were used to coat scaffolds, enabled by the capacity of PPi to bind to hydroxyapatite, and computational simulations were used to analyze the interfacial bonding of PPi and hydroxyapatite. The macrophage phenotype-modulating and osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling effects were evaluated in vivo. In summary, this study suggests that the combination of hierarchical porous scaffolds and PPi-MT-sEVs could be a promising candidate for the clinical treatment of bone defects."

It has been widely approved to be beneficial to the repair of bone injury by procedurally inhibiting the inflammatory response in the early stage and promoting bone regeneration in the late stage. In this study, the nano-hydroxyapatite/Poly(glycolide-co-caprolactone) (n-HA/PGCL) scaffold loaded with icariin was fabricated by fused deposition modeling technique, and the quercetin-loaded GelMA was further filled into the scaffold pores via light-curing methods to form a biphasic scaffold loaded with dual molecules (PHI\u2009+\u2009GQ scaffold). The releases of icariin and quercetin were sequential due to different degradation rates of GelMA and PGCL. In vitro, the scaffold not only scavenged reactive oxygen species production, but also promoted osteogenic differentiation of the MC-3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, in vivo bone reconstruction of PHI\u2009+\u2009GQ scaffold was better than other groups by assessment of micro-CT data. In addition, the immunofluorescence staining of Arg-1 and iNOS indicated that PHI\u2009+\u2009GQ scaffold created an immune microenvironment conducive to bone repair due to the release of quercetin in the early stage, and HE and Masson staining suggested that PHI\u2009+\u2009GQ scaffold induced more new bone formation. These results demonstrated that the biphasic scaffold loaded with icariin and quercetin had both antioxidants in the early stage and osteogenesis properties in the late stage, obtaining satisfactory bone repair outcomes. Thus, the biphasic scaffold loaded with icariin and quercetin for sequential release could provide a promising solution for the restoration of bone defects and represent a potential strategy for bone regeneration."

                "abstract": "With the rise of bone tissue engineering (BET), 3D-printed HA/PCL scaffolds for bone defect repair have been extensively studied. However, little research has been conducted on the differences in osteogenic induction and regulation of macrophage (MPs) polarisation properties of HA/PCL scaffolds with different fibre orientations. Here, we applied 3D printing technology to prepare three sets of HA/PCL scaffolds with different fibre orientations (0-90, 0-90-135, and 0-90-45) to study the differences in physicochemical properties and to investigate the response effects of MPs and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on scaffolds with different fibre orientations. The results showed that multi-angle staggered fibres affected the overall porosity and compressive strength of the scaffolds. Compared with the other two groups, the 0-90-45 scaffold induced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs more significantly, while promoting the polarisation of MPs towards the M2 phenotype to form an osteogenic-friendly immune microenvironment. Unexpectedly, the 0-90-45 scaffold significantly upregulated the expression of angiogenic genes (PDGF, VEGF). Therefore, we conclude that the multi-angle interlaced fibres better mimic the physiological structure of cancellous bone, and that the excellent biomimetic properties reflect the best in vitro osteogenic, immunomodulatory and angiogenic effects. In conclusion, this study is a step forward in the exploration of BET scaffolds and provides a very promising bone filling material."

                "abstract": "Osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) is essential for bone tissue regeneration and repair. However, this process is often hindered by an unstable differentiation influenced by local microenvironmental factors. While small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from osteogenically induced adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) reportedly can promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the mRNA expression profile of ADSC-sEVs+ and explored the role of specific mRNAs in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. We first validated the osteogenic induction activity of ADSC-sEVs+ through both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we compared mRNA expression between ADSC-sEVs+ and ADSC-sEVs and further assessed the impact of specific mRNAs on the differentiation of BMSCs through a series of in\u00a0vitro experiments. One of our key findings was that osterix mRNA was highly enriched in ADSC-sEVs+, which significantly enhanced alkaline phosphatase staining and upregulated downstream osteoblastic markers in BMSCs. Both overexpression and knockdown experiments confirmed that osterix mRNA is a critical signalling molecule that facilitates the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts through ADSC-sEVs+. This finding expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and offers a promising strategy for targeted osteoblastic differentiation in clinical applications."

In this study, strontium-containing hydroxyapatite (SrHA) powder was synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and then poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL)/HA and PCL/SrHA composite scaffolds were prepared by the high-temperature melt extrusion 3D printing technology. The basic physical and chemical properties, in vitro biological properties, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis abilities of the scaffold were studied. The results showed that HA and SrHA were uniformly embedded in the composite scaffold, and the scaffold exhibited a 3D interconnected porous structure and rough microsurface. The in vitro release curve showed that Sr2+ and Ca2+ were continuously released from the PCL/SrHA scaffold. In order to verify the performance of the composite scaffold in bone regeneration, the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic osteoblasts (MC3T3E1) grown on the scaffold were evaluated. The experimental results showed that the incorporation of SrHA significantly promoted cell proliferation. Compared with the PCL/HA scaffold, the PCL/SrHA scaffold could better promote cell osteogenic differentiation. Deferoxamine (DFO) was loaded on the surface of the PCL/SrHA scaffold. By studying the proliferation, angiogenesis, and expression of osteogenesis and angiogenesis-related genes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on PCL/SrHA@DFO scaffold, it was verified that DFO had the ability to promote angiogenesis. It could induce angiogenesis in vitro in combination with Sr2+. Therefore, we believe that the composite scaffold has potential application prospects in the field of bone tissue engineering."

                "abstract": "Background: Delayed healing and non-healing of bone defects pose significant challenges in clinical practice, with metal materials increasingly recognized for their significance in addressing these issues. Among these materials, Strontium (Sr) and Zinc (Zn) have emerged as promising agents for promoting bone repair. Building upon this insight, this research evaluates the impact of a porous Sr@Zn@SiO2 nanocomposite implant on bone regeneration, aiming to advance the field of bone repair. Methods: The preparation of the Sr@Zn@SiO2 composite implant involves various techniques such as roasting, centrifugation, and washing. The material's composition is examined, and its microstructure and element distribution are analyzed using TEM and elemental scanning technology. In vitro experiments entail the isolation and characterization of BMSCs followed by safety assessments of the implant material, evaluation of cell migration capabilities, and relevant proliferation markers. Mechanistically, this study delves into key targets associated with significant changes in the osteogenic process. In vivo experiments involve establishing a rat femur bone defect model, followed by assessment of the osteogenic potential of Sr@Zn@SiO2 using Micro-CT imaging and tissue section staining. Results: Through in vivo and in vitro investigations, we validate the osteogenic efficacy of the Sr@Zn@SiO2 composite implant. In vitro analyses demonstrate that porous Sr@Zn@SiO2 nanocomposite materials upregulate BMP-2 expression, leading to the activation of Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream osteogenic genes, culminating in BMSCs osteogenic differentiation and bone proliferation. And the migration of BMSCs is closely related to the high expression of CXCL12/CXCR4, which will also provide the conditions for osteogenesis. In vivo, the osteogenic ability of Sr@Zn@SiO2 was also confirmed in rats. Conclusion: In our research, the porous Sr@Zn@SiO2 composite implant displays prominent osteogenic effect and promotes the migration and differentiation of BMSCs to promote bone defect healing. This bioactive implant has surgical application potential in the future."

However, low retention of sEVs affects their therapeutic effects. Clinically used natural substitute inorganic bovine bone mineral (Bio-Oss) bone powder lacks high compactibility and efficient osteo-inductivity that limit its clinical application in repairing large bone defects. In this study, a poly ethylene glycol/hyaluronic acid (PEG/HA) hydrogel was used to stabilize Bio-Oss and incorporate rat bone marrow stem cell-derived sEVs (rBMSCs-sEVs) to engineer a PEG/HA-Bio-Oss (PEG/HA-Bio) composite scaffold. Encapsulation and sustained release of sEVs in hydrogel scaffold can enhance the retention of sEVs in targeted area, achieving long-lasting repair effect. Meanwhile, synergistic administration of sEVs and Bio-Oss in cranial defect can improve therapeutic effects. The PEG/HA-Bio composite scaffold showed good mechanical properties and biocompatibility, supporting the growth of rBMSCs. Furthermore, sEVs enhancedin vitrocell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. Implantation of sEVs/PEG/HA-Bio in rat cranial defect model promotedin vivobone regeneration, suggesting the great potential of sEVs/PEG/HA-Bio composite scaffold for bone repair and regeneration.

With this objective in mind, this study aimed to evaluate the osteogenic potential of 3D-printed allograft-alginate-gelatin scaffolds coated with stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). The primary goal was to develop a tissue-engineered construct capable of facilitating efficient bone regeneration through the utilization of biomaterials with advantageous properties and patient-derived products. To achieve this goal, 3D-printed gelatin, allograft, and alginate scaffolds were utilized, along with stem cells derived from the buccal fat pad and human-derived components (PRF, SVF). Cells were seeded onto scaffolds, both with and without SVF/PRF, and subjected to comprehensive assessments including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation (gene expression and protein secretion levels), penetration, and gene expression analysis over 14 days. The data was reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Two-way or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by a Tukey post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was determined as a p value below 0.05. The scaffolds demonstrated structural integrity, and the addition of PRF coatings significantly enhanced cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation compared to other groups. Gene expression analysis showed increased expression of osteogenic and angiogenic markers in the PRF-coated scaffolds. These findings highlight the promising role of PRF-coated scaffolds in promoting osteogenesis and facilitating bone tissue regeneration. This study emphasizes the development of patient-specific tissue-engineered constructs as a valuable approach for effective bone regeneration."

This study aims to develop and investigate the properties of 3D scaffolds composed of PLGA and adenoviral constructs carrying the BMP2 gene (Ad-BMP2), both in vitro and in vivo. The elastic modulus of the disk-shaped PLGA scaffolds created using a specialized 3D printer was determined by compressive testing in both axial and radial directions. In vitro cytocompatibility was assessed using adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). The ability of Ad-BMP2 to transduce cells was evaluated. The osteoinductive and biocompatible properties of the scaffolds were also assessed in vivo. The Young's modulus of the 3D-printed PLGA scaffolds exhibited comparable values in both axial and radial compression directions, measuring 3.4 \u00b1 0.7 MPa for axial and 3.17 \u00b1 1.4 MPa for radial compression. The scaffolds promoted cell adhesion and had no cytotoxic effect on ADSCs. Ad-BMP2 successfully transduced the cells and induced osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated that the 3D-printed PLGA scaffolds had osteoinductive properties, promoting bone formation within the scaffold filaments as well as at the center of a critical calvarial bone defect."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) have great potential to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis during bone defect repair through paracrine effects, but their therapeutic efficacy depends on effective cellular assembly and delivery. In this work, we developed various microspheres with different pore sizes for multi-cellular delivery to enhance the angiogenic and osteogenic capability via combining microfluidic and gradient freeze-drying techniques. The particle and pore size of fabricated porous gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based hydrogel microspheres (PGMS) could be controllable through adjusting the freezing time of hydrogel microspheres, the range of particles and pores size are 150-250\u00a0\u03bcm and 10-100\u00a0\u03bcm with different freezing time from 0\u00a0min to 30\u00a0min.

Furthermore, the co-assembly and delivery of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on the PGMS was achieved and an optimal cellular ratio of BMSCs to HUVECs (20:2) was established for co-culturing of them to achieve optimal paracrine effects, further promoting osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis. Finally, results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the developed PGMS with co-assembly of BMSCs to HUVECs contributed to accelerate bone regeneration and vascularization process daringly, exhibited great potential in vascularized bone tissue reconstruction."

            "abstract": "Current rodent models of menopause fail to adequately recapitulate the menopause transition. The intact aging model fails to achieve very low estrogen levels, and the ovariectomy model lacks a perimenopause phase. A new rodent model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) successfully replicates human perimenopause and postmenopause, including estrous acyclicity and fluctuating, followed by undetectable, estrogen levels, and allows for the dissociation of the effects of hormone levels from the effects of aging. In this model, an ovotoxic chemical, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), selective for primary and primordial follicles, is injected intraperitonelly in animals for 15 days. As the mature follicle population is depleted through natural cycling, ovarian failure follows increasing periods of acyclity. Administered at low doses, VCD specifically causes apoptotic cell death of primordial follicles but does not affect other peripheral tissues, including the liver and spleen, nor does it affect brain inflammation markers. In addition to reducing confounds associated with genetic and surgical manipulations, the AOF model maintains the presence of ovarian tissue which importantly parallels to the menopause transition in humans. The VCD injection procedure can be applied to studies using transgenic or knockout mice strains, or in other disease-state models (e.g., ischemia, atherosclerosis, or diabetes). This AOF model of menopause will generate new insights into women's health particularly in determining the critical periods (i.e., a window of opportunity) during perimenopause for restoring ovarian hormones for the most efficacious effect on memory and mood disorders as well as other menopausal symptoms."

                "abstract": "Women are born with an abundant but finite pool of ovarian follicles, which naturally and progressively decreased during their reproductive years until menstrual periods stop permanently (menopause). Perimenopause represents the transition from reproductive to non-reproductive life. It is usually characterized by neuroendocrine, metabolic and behavioral changes, which result from a follicular depletion and reduced number of ovarian follicles. During this period, around 45-50 years old, women are more likely to express mood disorders, anxiety, irritability and vasomotor symptoms. The current animal models of reproductive aging do not successfully replicate human perimenopause and the gradual changes that occur in this phase. While the traditional rat model of menopause involves ovariectomy or surgical menopause consisting of the rapid and definitive removal of the ovaries resulting in a complete loss of all ovarian hormones, natural or transitional menopause is achieved by the selective loss of ovarian follicles (perimenopause period). However, the natural aging rodent (around 18-24 months) model fails to reach very low estrogen concentrations and overlaps the processes of somatic and reproductive aging. The chronic exposure of young rodents to 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) is a well-established experimental model for perimenopause and menopause studies. VCD induces loss of ovarian small follicles (primary and primordial) in mice and rats by accelerating the natural process of atresia (apoptosis). The VCD, ovary-intact or accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) model is the experimental model that most closely matches natural human progression to menopause mimicking both hormonal and behavioral changes typically manifested by women in perimenopause. Graphical abstract: The female reproductive system is regulated by a series of neuroendocrine events controlled by central and peripheral components. (A). The mechanisms involved in this control are extremely complex and have not yet been fully clarified. In female mammals whose ovulation (the most important event in a reproductive cycle) occurs spontaneously, reproductive success is achieved through the precise functional and temporal integration of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary (HPO) axis. (B). In women, loss of fertility appears to be primarily associated with exhaustion of ovarian follicles, and this process occurs progressively until complete follicular exhaustion marked by the final menstrual period (FMP). (C). While in female rodents, reproductive aging seems to begin as a neuroendocrine process, in which changes in hypothalamic/pituitary function appear independently of follicular atresia. The traditional rat model of menopause, ovariectomy or surgical menopause consists of the rapid and definitive removal of the ovaries resulting in a complete loss of all ovarian hormones. (D). The chronic exposure (15-30 days) to the chemical compound 4-vinylcyclehexene diepoxide (VCD) in young rodents accelerates gradual failure of ovarian function by progressive depletion of primordial and primary follicles, but retains residual ovarian tissue before brain alterations that occurs in women in perimenopause. Low doses of VCD cause the selective destruction of the small preantral follicles of the ovary without affecting other peripheral tissues."

Current animal models of perimenopause fail to adequately replicate this particular stage in female life, while current in vitro models are too simplistic and cannot account for systemic effects. Neither the naturally-ageing animal model, nor the ovariectomised animal model, mimic the natural transitional process that is the menopause. In vivo and in vitro studies have confirmed that the occupational chemical, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), can cause selective destruction of the ovarian primordial and primary follicles of rats and mice by accelerating the apoptotic process, which successfully mimics the perimenopausal state in women. However, it is the in vivo VCD-induced rodent perimenopausal models that are currently the most widely used in research, rather than any of the available in vitro models. Studies on the mechanisms involved have found that VCD induces ovotoxicity via interference with the c-kit/kit ligand and apoptotic signalling pathways, among others. Overall, the VCD-induced perimenopausal animal models have provided some insight into female perimenopause, but they are far from ideal models of the human situation. "

                "abstract": "Perimenopause, a transition period that precedes menopause, is characterized by neuroendocrine, metabolic and behavioral changes, and is associated with increased vulnerability to affective disorders. The decrease in ovarian follicles during perimenopause contributes to a dynamic and complex hormonal milieu that is not yet well characterized. In rodents, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) induces a gradual depletion of ovarian follicles, modeling the transition to menopause in women. This study was aimed to investigate, in VCD-treated rats, the hormonal status and the behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM), a widely used test to assess anxiety-like behavior. From the postnatal day 28, rats were treated with VCD or vehicle for 15 days. At 80\u00b15 days after the beginning of treatment the experiments were performed at proestrus and diestrus. In the first experiment rats were decapitated, ovary was collected and blood samples were taken for estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulant hormone (FSH), testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and corticosterone measurements. In the second experiment, rats were subjected to the EPM for 5 min, and behavioral categories recorded. Administration of VCD induced follicular depletion as well as an increase of the number of atretic follicles demonstrating the treatment efficacy. The transitional follicular depletion was accompanied by lower progesterone, testosterone and DHT with no changes in the FSH, estradiol and corticosterone plasma levels. On the EPM, rats showed decreased open arm exploration and increased risk assessment behavior, indicating increased anxiety. These findings show that administration of VCD to induce ovarian failure results in endocrine and anxiety-related changes that are similar to the symptoms exhibited by women during menopause transition. Thus, this model seems to be promising in the study of perimenopause-related changes."

                "abstract": "Premenopausal females are resistant to the development of hypertension, and this protection is lost after the onset of menopause, resulting in a sharp increase in disease onset and severity. However, it is unknown how a fluctuating ovarian hormone environment during the transition from perimenopause to menopause impacts the onset of hypertension, and whether interventions during perimenopause prevent disease onset after menopause. A gradual transition to menopause was induced by repeated daily injections of 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD). ANG II (800 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) was infused into perimenopausal and menopausal female mice for 14 days. A separate cohort of mice received 17\u03b2-estradiol replacement during perimenopause. ANG II infusion produced significantly higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) in menopausal vs. cycling females, and 17\u03b2-estradiol replacement prevented this increase. In contrast, MAP was not significantly different when ANG II was infused into perimenopausal and cycling females, suggesting that female resistance to ANG II-induced hypertension is intact during perimenopause. ANG II infusion caused a significant glomerular hypertrophy, and hypertrophy was not impacted by hormonal status. Expression levels of aquaporin-2 (AQP2), a collecting duct protein, have been suggested to reflect blood pressure. AQP2 protein expression was significantly downregulated in the renal cortex of the ANG II-infused menopause group, where blood pressure was increased. AQP2 expression levels were restored to control levels with 17\u03b2-estradiol replacement. This study indicates that the changing hormonal environment in the VCD model of menopause impacts the severity of ANG II-induced hypertension. These data highlight the utility of the ovary-intact VCD model of menopause as a clinically relevant model to investigate the physiological mechanisms of hypertension that occur in women during the transition into menopause.

Chemicals that destroy primordial follicles are of concern to women because exposure can result in premature ovarian failure (early menopause). Initial studies using in vivo exposure of rats determined that VCD specifically targets primordial and primary (small pre-antral) follicles and that repeated dosing is required. Through a method of isolation of ovarian small follicles, biochemical and molecular studies determined that intracellular pro-apoptotic pathways are activated following VCD dosing in rats. Subsequently an in vitro system using cultured whole neonatal rat ovaries was developed to provide more mechanistic information. That approach was used to demonstrate that the cell survival c-kit/kit ligand signaling pathway is the direct target for VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Specifically, VCD directly interacts with the oocyte-associated c-kit receptor to inhibit its autophosphorylation, and thereby impair oocyte viability. The cellular and molecular approach developed to determine these findings is described in this article."

                "abstract": "As both perimenopausal and menopausal periods are recognized critical windows of susceptibility for breast carcinogenesis, development of a physiologically relevant model has been warranted. The traditional ovariectomy model causes instant removal of the entire hormonal repertoire produced by the ovary, which does not accurately approximate human natural menopause with gradual transition. Here, we characterized the mammary glands of 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-treated animals at different time points, revealing that the model can provide the mammary glands with both perimenopausal and menopausal states. The perimenopausal gland showed moderate regression in ductal structure with no responsiveness to external hormones, while the menopausal gland showed severe regression with hypersensitivity to hormones. Leveraging the findings on the VCD model, effects of a major endocrine disruptor (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs) on the mammary gland were examined during and after menopausal transition, with the two exposure modes; low-dose, chronic (environmental) and high-dose, subacute (experimental). All conditions of PBDE exposure did not augment or compromise the macroscopic ductal reorganization resulting from menopausal transition and/or hormonal treatments. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the experimental PBDE exposure during the post-menopausal period caused specific transcriptomic changes in the non-epithelial compartment such as Errfi1 upregulation in fibroblasts. The environmental PBDE exposure resulted in similar transcriptomic changes to a lesser extent. In summary, the VCD mouse model provides both perimenopausal and menopausal windows of susceptibility for the breast cancer research community. PBDEs, including all tested models, may affect the post-menopausal gland including impacts on the non-epithelial compartments."

                "abstract": "AIM: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is lower in pre-menopausal females vs age matched males. After menopause risk equals or exceeds that of males. CVD protection of pre-menopausal females is ascribed to high circulating oestrogen levels. Despite experimental evidence that oestrogen are cardioprotective, oestrogen replacement therapy trials have not shown clear benefits. One hypothesis to explain the discrepancy proposed hearts remodel during peri-menopause. Peri-menopasual myocardial changes have never been investigated, nor has the ability of oestrogen to regulate heart function during peri-menopause. METHODS: We injected female mice with 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD, 160 mg/kg/d IP) to cause gradual ovarian failure over 120d and act as a peri-menopausal model RESULTS: Left ventricular function assessed by Langendorff perfusion found no changes in VCD-injected mice at 60 or 120 days compared to intact mice. Cardiac myofilament activity was altered at 60 and 120 days indicating a molecular remodelling in peri-menopause. Myocardial TGF-\u03b21 increased at 60 days post-VCD treatment along with reduced Akt phosphorylation. Acute activation of oestrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) or -\u03b2 (ER\u03b2) depressed left ventricular contractility in hearts from intact mice. ER-regulation of myocardial and myofilament function, and myofilament phosphorylation, were disrupted in the peri-menopausal model. Disruption occurred without alterations in total ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate remodelling of the heart in a model of peri-menopause, along with a disruption in ER-dependent regulation of the heart. These data indicate that oestrogen replacement therapy initiated after menopause affects a heart that is profoundly different from that found in reproductively intact animals."

Investigating VCD's pathogenic mechanisms can offer insights for the prevention of ovarian impairment and the treatment of POI. This study established a mouse model of POI through intraperitoneal injection of VCD into female C57BL/6 mice for 15 days. The results were then compared with those of the control group, including a comparison of phenotypic characteristics and transcriptome differences, at two time points: day 15 and day 30. Through a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), key genes were identified and validated some using RT-PCR. The results revealed significant impacts on sex hormone levels, follicle number, and the estrous cycle in VCD-induced POI mice on both day 15 and day 30. The DEGs and enrichment results obtained on day 15 were not as significant as those obtained on day 30. The results of this study provide a preliminary indication that steroid hormone synthesis, DNA damage repair, and impaired oocyte mitosis are pivotal in VCD-mediated ovarian dysfunction. This dysfunction may have been caused by VCD damage to the primordial follicular pool, impairing follicular development and aggravating ovarian damage over time, making it gradually difficult for the ovaries to perform their normal functions."

                "abstract": "Female mammals are born with a finite number of ovarian primordial follicles that cannot be regenerated; thus, chemicals that destroy oocytes contained in these follicles can produce premature ovarian failure (early menopuase in women). Exposure of women to known ovotoxicants, such as contaminants in cigarette smoke, is associated with early menopause. Thus, the potential risks posed by ovotoxic chemicals is of concern. Our studies have focused on the environmental chemical 4-vinylcyclohexene (VCH), which is produced during the manufacture of rubber tires, flame retardants, insecticides, plasticizers, and antioxidants. Dosing of female rats and mice with the ovotoxic diepoxide metabolite of VCH, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), for 30 days destroyed the majority of ovarian primordial follicles. Using VCD in rats as a generalized model for ovotoxicity, we determined that 1) repeated daily dosing is required, 2) cell death is via apoptosis, and 3) altered expression of specific genes is involved. An integrated approach at the morphologic, biochemical, and molecular level was used to support these conclusions. Studies in isolated rat small preantral follicles (targeted for VCD-induced ovotoxicity) focused on the role of cell death genes, mitochondrion-associated events, and VCD metabolism. We also evaluated how this information relates to human risk for early menopause. These animal research results provide a better understanding of the potential risk of human exposure to environmental ovarian toxicants and greater insight as to the impact of these toxicants on reproductive health in women."

                "abstract": "Our goal is to understand how loss of circulating estrogens and estrogen replacement affect brain physiology and function, particularly in brain regions involved in cognitive processes. We recently conducted a large metabolomics study characterizing the effects of rodent models of menopause and treatment with estrogen receptor (ER) agonists on neurochemical targets in hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum. Here we characterize effects on levels of several key enzymes involved in glucose utilization and energy production, specifically phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase. We also evaluated effects on levels of \u03b2-actin and \u03b1-tubulin, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and levels of ATP citrate lyase. All experiments were conducted in young adult rats. Experiment 1 compared the effects of ovariectomy (OVX), a model of surgical menopause, and 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-treatments, a model of transitional menopause, with tissues collected at proestrus and at diestrus. Experiment 2 used a separate cohort of rats to evaluate the same targets in OVX and VCD-treated rats treated with estradiol or with selective ER agonists. Differences in the expression of metabolic enzymes between cycling animals and models of surgical and transitional menopause were detected. These differences were model-, region- and time- dependent, and were modulated by selective ER agonists. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that loss of ovarian function and ER agonist treatments have differing effects in OVX vs. VCD-treated rats. Differences may help to explain differences in the effects of estrogen treatments on brain function and cognition in women who have experienced surgical vs. transitional menopause."

                "abstract": "Accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) can be induced in young mice with low doses of 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), modeling the hormone changes observed across menopause. We assessed markers of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial learning longitudinally at 4 time points across the AOF model: premenopause, early perimenopause, late perimenopause, and postmenopause (POST). As others have shown, VCD administration decreased ovarian follicle counts and increased acyclicity as the model progressed to POST but with no impact on organ or body weights. The morphology of Iba1 immunoreactive microglia did not differ between vehicle- and VCD-administered mice. Hippocampal postsynaptic density 95 levels were minimally altered across the AOF model but decreased at POST in CA3b 24 hours after exogenous estradiol benzoate (EB). In contrast, hippocampal phosphorylated AKT levels transiently decreased in premenopause but increased at POST after 24 hours of EB in select subregions. Electron microscopy revealed fewer estrogen receptor \u03b1 containing dendritic spines and terminals in CA1 stratum radiatum at POST. mRNA levels of most brain-derived neurotrophic factor exons (except V and VI) were lower in POST compared with ovariectomized mice. Exon V was sensitive to 24 hours of EB administration in POST-VCD. Anxiety-like behavior was unaffected at any menopause phase. Spatial learning was unaffected in all groups, but POST-VCD mice performed below chance. Our results suggest that the AOF model is suitable for longitudinal studies of neurobiological changes across the menopause transition in mice. Our findings also point to complex interactions between estrogen receptors and pathways involved in synaptic plasticity. "

                "abstract": "17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-containing hormone therapy is a safe, effective way to alleviate unwanted menopause symptoms. Preclinical research has focused upon the role of E2 in learning and memory using a surgically menopausal rodent model whereby the ovaries are removed. Given that most women retain their reproductive tract and undergo a natural menopause transition, it is necessary to understand how exogenous E2 impacts a structurally intact, but follicle-deplete, system. In the current study, 8\u00a0month old female rats were administered the ovatoxin 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), which accelerates ovarian follicular depletion, to model the human menopause transition. After follicular depletion, at 11\u00a0months old, rats were administered Vehicle or tonic E2 treatment for 12 days prior to behavioral evaluation on spatial working and reference memory tasks. Results demonstrated that E2 had both enhancing and impairing effects on taxed working memory depending upon the learning or retention phases of the water radial-arm maze, with no impact on reference memory. Relationships between memory scores and circulating estrogen levels were specific to follicle-depleted rats without E2 treatment. Collectively, findings demonstrate the complexity of E2 administration in a follicle-depleted background, with cognitive effects specific to working memory; furthermore, E2 administration altered circulating hormonal milieu and relationships between hormone profiles and memory. In sum, menopausal etiology impacts the parameters of E2 effects on cognition, complementing prior work with other estrogen compounds. Deciphering estrogenic actions in a system wherein the reproductive tract remains intact with follicle-depleted ovaries, thus modeling the majority or menopausal women, is critical for translational perspectives."

                "abstract": "Hypertension in male and aging female rodents is associated with glutamate-dependent plasticity in the hypothalamus, but existing models have failed to capture distinct transitional menopausal phases that could have a significant impact on the synaptic plasticity and emergent hypertension. In rodents, accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) induced by systemic injection of 4-vinylcyclohexane diepoxide mimics the estrogen fluctuations seen in human menopause including the perimenopause transition (peri-AOF) and postmenopause (post-AOF). Thus, we used the mouse AOF model to determine the impact of slow-pressor angiotensin II (AngII) administration on blood pressure and on the subcellular distribution of obligatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor GluN1 subunits in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), a key estrogen-responsive cardiovascular regulatory area. Estrogen-sensitive neuronal profiles were identified in mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein under the promoter for estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b2, a major ER in the PVN. Slow-pressor AngII increased arterial blood pressure in mice at peri- and post-AOF time points. In control oil-injected (nonhypertensive) mice, AngII decreased the total number of GluN1 in ER\u03b2-containing PVN dendrites. In contrast, AngII resulted in a reapportionment of GluN1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of ER\u03b2-containing PVN dendrites in peri-AOF mice. Moreover, in post-AOF mice, AngII increased total GluN1, dendritic size and radical production in ER\u03b2-containing neurons. These results indicate that unique patterns of hypothalamic glutamate receptor plasticity and dendritic structure accompany the elevated blood pressure in peri- and post-AOF time points. Our findings suggest the possibility that distinct neurobiological processes are associated with the increased blood pressure during perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods."

                "abstract": "Clinical research suggests that type of ovarian hormone loss at menopause influences cognition. Until recently ovariectomy (OVX) has been the primary rodent model to examine effects of ovarian hormone loss on cognition. This model limits evaluations to abrupt and complete ovarian hormone loss, modeling less than 13% of women who receive surgical menopause. The majority of women do not have their ovaries surgically removed and undergo transitional hormone loss via ovarian follicular depletion. 4-Vinylcyclohexene-diepoxide (VCD) produces gradual ovarian follicular depletion in the rodent, with hormone profiles more similar to naturally menopausal women vs. OVX. We directly compared VCD and OVX models to examine whether type of hormone loss (transitional vs. surgical) impacted cognition as assessed on a maze battery as well as the cholinergic system tested via scopolamine mnemonic challenge and brain acetylcholinesterase activity. Middle-aged rats received either sham surgery, OVX surgery, VCD, or VCD then OVX to assess effects of removal of residual ovarian output after transitional menopause and follicular depletion. VCD-induced transitional menopause impaired learning of a spatial recent memory task; surgical removal of residual ovarian hormones by OVX abolished this negative effect of transitional menopause. Furthermore, transitional menopause before OVX was better for memory than an abrupt loss of hormones via OVX only. Surgical ovarian hormone loss, regardless of menopause history, increased hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity. Circulating gonadotropin and androstenedione levels were related to cognitive competence. Collectively, findings suggest that in the rat, initiation of transitional menopause before surgical ovary removal can benefit mnemonic function and could obviate some negative cognitive consequences of surgical menopause alone."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed in women after menopause when the levels of the serum gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are increased because of the depletion of growing follicles within the ovary. The ability of FSH and LH to modulate the disease has not been well studied owing to a lack of physiologically relevant models of ovarian cancer. In this study, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) was used to deplete ovarian follicles and increase the levels of circulating FSH and LH in the tgCAG-LS-TAg mouse model of ovarian cancer. METHODS: VCD-induced follicle depletion was performed either before or after induction of the oncogene SV40 large and small T-antigens in the ovarian surface epithelial cells of tgCAG-LS-TAg mice, which was mediated by the intrabursal delivery of an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre). RESULTS: tgCAG-LS-TAg mice injected with AdCre developed undifferentiated ovarian tumors with mixed epithelial and stromal components and some features of sex cord stromal tumors. Treatment with VCD before or after AdCre injection yielded tumors of similar histology, but with the unique appearance of Sertoli cell nests. In mice treated with VCD before the induction of tumorigenesis, the ovarian tumors tended to grow more slowly. The human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and OVCAR3 responded similarly to increased levels of gonadotropins in a second model of menopause, growing more slowly in ovariectomized mice compared with cycling controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that follicle depletion and increased gonadotropin levels can alter the histology and the rate of growth of ovarian tumors."

                "abstract": "Menopause is an important public health issue because of its association with a number of disorders. Androgens produced by residual ovarian tissue after menopause could impact the development of these disorders. It has been unclear, however, whether the postmenopausal ovary retains steroidogenic capacity. Thus, an ovary-intact mouse model for menopause that uses the occupational chemical 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) was used to characterize the expression of steroidogenic genes in residual ovarian tissue of follicle-depleted mice. Female B6C3F1 mice (age, 28 days) were dosed daily for 20 days with either vehicle or VCD (160 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) to induce ovarian failure. Ovaries were collected on Day 181 and analyzed for mRNA and protein. Acyclic aged mice were used as controls for natural ovarian senescence. Relative to cycling controls, expression of mRNA encoding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star); cholesterol side-chain cleavage (Cyp11a1); 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b); 17alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp17a1); scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (Scarb1); low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr); and luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) was enriched in VCD-treated ovaries. In acyclic aged ovaries, mRNA expression for only Cyp17a1 and Lhcgr was greater than that in controls. Compared to cycling controls, ovaries from VCD-treated and aged mice had similar levels of HSD3B, CYP17A1, and LHCGR protein. The pattern of protein immunofluorescence staining for HSD3B in follicle-depleted (VCD-treated) ovaries was homogeneous, whereas that for CYP17A1 was only seen in residual interstitial cells. Circulating levels of FSH and LH were increased, and androstenedione levels were detectable following follicle depletion in VCD-treated mice. These findings support the idea that residual ovarian tissue in VCD-treated mice retains androgenic capacity."

                "abstract": "AIMS: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a phenomenon in which the ovaries fail before the age of 40\u00a0years. Prior research has used a wide range of mouse models designed to reflect different causes of POF, including genetic factors, iatrogenic factors, and immune factors. The current study employed a mouse model of POF induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD). VCD can specifically kill primordial and primary ovarian follicles, which destroys the follicular reserve and causes POF. The current study sought to specify and extend the applications of this model by examining the effect of timing and VCD dose and by exploring the effect of the model on systems outside of the ovaries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VCD-induced mouse model of POF was constructed using established methods (VCD injected continuously at a concentration of 160\u00a0mg/kg for 15\u00a0days). Evidence for a graded effect of VCD was observed using a range of concentrations, and the best windows for examining VCD's effects on follicles and associated tissues were identified. KEY FINDINGS: The mouse model used here successfully simulated two common complications of POF - emotional changes and decreased bone density. The model's application was then extended to examine the links between disease and intestinal microorganisms, and evidence was found linking POF to the reproductively relevant composition of the gut microbiota. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide novel methodological guidance for future research, and they significantly extend the applications and scope of VCD-induced POF mouse models."

                "abstract": "Cognitive changes that occur during mid-life and beyond are linked to both aging and the menopause transition. Studies in women suggest that the age at menopause onset can impact cognitive status later in life; yet, little is known about memory changes that occur during the transitional period to the postmenopausal state. The 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) model simulates transitional menopause in rodents by depleting the immature ovarian follicle reserve and allowing animals to retain their follicle-deplete ovarian tissue, resulting in a profile similar to the majority of perimenopausal women. Here, Vehicle or VCD treatment was administered to ovary-intact adult and middle-aged Fischer-344 rats to assess the trajectory of cognitive change across time with normal aging and aging with transitional menopause via VCD-induced follicular depletion, as well as to evaluate whether age at the onset of follicular depletion plays a role in cognitive outcomes. Animals experiencing the onset of menopause at a younger age exhibited impaired spatial memory early in the transition to a follicle-deplete state. Additionally, at the mid- and post- follicular depletion time points, VCD-induced follicular depletion amplified an age effect on memory. Overall, these findings suggest that age at the onset of menopause is a critical parameter to consider when evaluating learning and memory across the transition to reproductive senescence. From a translational perspective, this study illustrates how age at menopause onset might impact cognition in menopausal women, and provides insight into time points to explore for the window of opportunity for hormone therapy during the menopause transition period. Hormone therapy during this critical juncture might be especially efficacious at attenuating age- and menopause- related cognitive decline, producing healthy brain aging profiles in women who retain their ovaries throughout their lifespan."

                "abstract": "Genetic and biochemical analyses have uncovered an essential role for nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in regulating phase II xenobiotic metabolism and antioxidant response. Here we show that Nrf2 protects against the ovarian toxicity of 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) in mice. Nrf2-/- female mice exposed to VCD exhibit an age-dependent decline in reproduction leading to secondary infertility accompanied by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism after 30 weeks of age. VCD is shown to selectively destroy small ovarian follicles, resulting in early depletion of functional follicles. Treatment with VCD induces apoptotic death in cultured cells and in ovarian follicles, suggesting apoptosis as a mechanism of follicle loss. Loss of Nrf2 function blocks the basal and inducible expression of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, a key enzyme in the detoxification of VCD, and increases the oxidative stress in cells that is further exacerbated by VCD. Foxo3a, a repressor in the early stages of follicle activation, displays reduced expression in Nrf2-/- ovaries, causing accelerated growth of follicles in the absence of exposure to exogenous chemicals. Furthermore, Foxo3a is degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway in untreated cells and is induced by VCD via both Nrf2-dependent transcription and protein stabilization. This study demonstrates that Nrf2 serves as an essential sensor and regulator of chemical homeostasis in ovarian cells, protecting the cells from toxic chemicals by controlling metabolic detoxification, reactive oxygen species defense, and Foxo3a expression. In addition, these findings raise the possibility that exposure to environmental or occupational ovotoxicants plays a role in the premature ovarian failure commonly associated with infertility and premature aging in women."

EAO was not induced by repeated injection of TH alone or KO3 LPS alone. At 10 days after the secondary injection of TH + KO3 LPS, there was marked infiltration with neutrophils in the seminiferous tubules and in the interstitium of the testis accompanied by destruction of the architecture of the seminiferous tubules and hypospermatogenesis. At 20 days after the secondary injection, infiltration with neutrophils in these areas had been replaced mostly by mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages). Histopathological changes of the testes became severer by further injections until the 10th injection. The EAO lesions in the terminal stage were characterized by complete destruction of the tubular architecture of the testis, fibrosis, and aspermatogenesis. Lesions in the terminal stage were not restored at all. Spermagglutinating antibody titers in the serum increased and delayed-type hypersensitivity against TH estimated by footpad swelling developed in mice injected repeatedly with TH + KO3 LPS.

This hypothesis was tested in relation to the autoimmune form of Addison's disease by studying autopsy adrenal glands from eight patients who had died of recent onset idiopathic Addison's disease. Using an immunohistochemical technique, class II MHC expression was found in a minority of adrenal cortical cells in the zona reticularis in 25 normal and four hyperplastic glands, while in Addison's disease almost all residual cortical cells expressed class II MHC. Three tuberculous adrenals showed increased staining of cortical cells around areas of chronic inflammation. It is concluded that since adrenal cortical cells of the normal gland express class II MHC, aberrant expression of this product cannot be invoked as an initiating mechanism in autoimmune adrenalitis. The increased cortical expression of class II MHC seen in idiopathic Addison's disease and tuberculosis may be due to local release of lymphokines by inflammatory cells."

This study was performed to seek a correlation between cellular and humoral immunity in experimental adrenalitis of the guinea pig. 34 guinea pigs (GP) were arranged into 4 experimental groups. One group (11 GP) was immunized with a single injection of 250 mg homologous adrenal antigen (HAA) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). A second group (6 GP) was similarly immunized at 1 and 14 days. A third group (9 GP) received 3 such injections at 1, 14, and 21 days. The fourth group (8 control GP) received RPMI-1640 in CFA. The following were performed on all groups 10 days after the last injection: lymphocyte response to PHA and HAA; HAA-specific macrophage migration inhibition (MIF); antibody titers to HAA by hemagglutination; and histopathology of adrenal, thyroid and testis. Antibody titers reached a mean level of 500 in each of the 3 HAA-immunized groups. In the single injection group, MIF activity and response to PHA were significantly increased when compared to the other immunized groups and to controls. Histopathologic changes were seen in adrenal glands of all immunized groups, but were most remarkable in the single injection group. Progressively fewer changes were observed in double and triple immunized groups. Antibody titers and histological changes were not found in controls. Histopathology correlated better with cell-mediated immune parameters than with specific antibody titers; this suggests that cell-mediated mechanisms may be the more important factor in pathologic lesions of experimental adrenalitis."

                "abstract": "Hypoadrenocorticism or Addison's disease (AD) is a functional disorder in which insufficient mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones are produced by the adrenal cortex. Human AD is usually attributed to lymphoplasmacytic adrenalitis with autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex. Lymphoplasmacytic adrenalitis is also reported in some descriptions of canine AD; however, the histological aspects of adrenalitis or adrenocortical atrophy have not been well characterized because microscopical examination is not required for diagnosis of AD. In this study, sections of adrenal glands from 33 dogs with adrenalitis were compared with those of 37 dogs without adrenal lesions. The affected dogs were classified clinically as having AD (n = 3), being suspected of having AD (n = 17), not having AD (n = 11) or were unclassified (n = 2). The adrenal inflammation was lymphoplasmacytic in 17 dogs, lymphocytic in four, lymphohistiocytic in one, granulomatous in three and neutrophilic in eight cases. Adrenal glands from control dogs lacked leucocyte infiltration and had a cortical to medullary area ratio of 1.1-7.2. All three dogs with AD, 8/17 dogs with suspected AD and 1/11 dogs without AD had a cortical to medullary area ratio <1.1. Because the area ratio was correlated (r = 0.94) with a linear cortical to medullary thickness ratio, a thickness ratio <1.1 could also indicate severe adrenocortical atrophy. Severe adrenocortical atrophy was associated typically with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and nearly complete loss of cortical cells; however, the zona glomerulosa was partially spared in three dogs with lymphoplasmacytic adrenalitis and severe cortical atrophy. In contrast, non-lymphoid inflammation was generally part of systemic disease, multifocal and was unaccompanied by severe adrenocortical atrophy."

Autoimmune lymphocytic adrenalitis is often combined with other autoimmune diseases and the most frequent cause of Addison's disease; however, it only becomes clinically apparent when more than 90\u2009% of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. Histological features are characterized by lymphoplasmacytic inflammation leading to an increased destruction of adrenocortical tissue but less severe courses can also occur. The second most frequent form of adrenalitis is adrenal tuberculosis, showing typical granulomatous findings that are nearly always caused by spreading from a tuberculous pulmonary focus. Other bacterial as well as viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and others, generally affect the adrenal glands only in patients with immunodeficiency disorders. In these infections, the adrenal cortex and medulla are frequently involved to roughly the same extent. Although surgical specimens from inflammatory adrenal lesions are extremely rare, the various forms of adrenalitis play an important role in the post-mortem examination of the adrenal glands for clarification of unclear causes of death (e.g. death during an Addisonian crisis).

This study looked at the adrenal glands of NOD and control mice both indirectly in vivo for hormone secretion, and directly in vitro for histological examination. Adrenal glands were taken from NOD mice, of both sexes, at different ages and corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) plasma levels evaluated by radioimmunoassay. There was evidence of lymphocytic infiltration of the adrenal glands, which however, was not accompanied by changes in corticosterone levels. There was a reduction in ACTH levels with age (R2 = 0.98). Mice from other strains (TFW, CBA and Balb/c) showed no lymphocytic infiltration in the adrenal glands and had lower levels of corticosterone than NOD mice of similar ages, but the differences were not significant. In conclusion, since the NOD mouse shows histological signs of adrenalitis, thyroiditis, sialitis and parathyroiditis, this animal can be regarded as a model to investigate mechanisms involved in diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of peripheral endocrine glands (polyendocrine autoimmunity). In addition, if diabetes in the NOD mouse is the result of a polyendocrine disorder rather than a process specific for diabetes, then this finding may have implications for attempts to prevent type-1 diabetes in humans."

When the surface IFL was done on established monolayers, the positive sera gave variable staining suggesting that more than one antigen may be expressed under different conditions. These results suggest that adrenal-specific 'microsomal' antigens are also represented on the plasma membrane, and support the hypothesis that organ-specific autoantibodies reacting with the surface of living target cells may have a pathogenic role in the development of autoimmune adrenalitis."

The lenticular proteins with MW of 15K to 25K correspond to the subunits of crystalline. These findings clearly demonstrated that our experimental model for autoimmune ophthalmitis was classified as the lens-induced uveitis.

On day 40 after the first injection of TC, the lesions induced were characterized by interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells and severe hypospermatogenesis in the testis with resulting whole organ atrophy and, in contrast, by a complete lack of epididymitis. Immunological studies revealed that this form of immunization caused both delayed-type hypersensitivity and humoral antibody responses to syngeneic TC. We compared the susceptibilities to the induction of this type of EAO among six different strains of inbred mice comprising A/J, AKR, BALB/c, C3H/He, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice. All strains except for DBA/2 mice developed lesions of EAO to a greater or lesser extent, and severe disease was induced with high frequency in two strains, C3H/He and A/J. As this murine model of EAO can be induced without the use of Freund's complete adjuvant and B. pertussis vaccine, it is simply 'autoimmune' in nature and may provide new ways for further investigation into the immunological mechanisms which regulate deleterious autoimmune reactions to germ cell antigens leading to the male infertility."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunotherapeutic modalities to bolster tumor immunity by targeting specific sites of the immune network often result in immune dysregulation with adverse autoimmune sequelae. To understand the relative risk for opportunistic autoimmune disorders, we studied established breast cancer models in mice resistant to experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT). EAT is a murine model of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune syndrome with established MHC class II control of susceptibility. The highly prevalent Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a prominent autoimmune sequela in immunotherapy, and its relative ease of diagnosis and treatment could serve as an early indicator of immune dysfunction. Here, we examined EAT-susceptible mice as a combined model for induction of tumor immunity and EAT under the umbrella of disrupted regulatory T cell (Treg) function. METHODS: Tumor immunity was evaluated in female CBA/J mice after depleting Tregs by intravenous administration of CD25 monoclonal antibody and/or immunizing with irradiated mammary adenocarcinoma cell line A22E-j before challenge; the role of T cell subsets was determined by injecting CD4 and/or CD8 antibodies after tumor immunity induction. Tumor growth was monitored 3\u00d7/week by palpation. Subsequent EAT was induced by mouse thyroglobulin (mTg) injections (4 daily doses/week over 4 weeks). For some experiments, EAT was induced before establishing tumor immunity by injecting mTg+interleukin-1, 7 days apart. EAT was evaluated by mTg antibodies and thyroid infiltration. RESULTS: Strong resistance to tumor challenge after Treg depletion and immunization with irradiated tumor cells required participation of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This immunity was not altered by induction of mild thyroiditis with our protocol of Treg depletion and adjuvant-free, soluble mTg injections. However, the increased incidence of mild thyroiditis can be directly related to Treg depletion needed to achieve strong tumor immunity. Moreover, when a subclinical, mild thyroiditis was induced with soluble mTg and low doses of interleukin-1, to simulate pre-existing autoimmunity in patients subjected to cancer immunotherapy, mononuclear infiltration into the thyroid was enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: Our current findings indicate that genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease could enhance autoimmunity during induction of tumor immunity in thyroiditis-susceptible mice. Thus, HLA genotyping of cancer patients should be part of any risk assessment."

This study aimed to explore the role of fatty acid oxidation and its pathway in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis and the immune mechanism. METHODS: In in vitro experiments, a total of 60 HT patients and 20 healthy controls were selected and their CD4+T cells were sorted by magnetic beads. All 80 samples were divided into 4 groups on average: HC group (Healthy control group), HT group (Hashimoto thyroiditis CD4+T cell inactive group), TCC group(Hashimoto thyroiditis CD4+T cell activation), TCC + ETO group(Hashimoto thyroiditis CD4+T cell activation + Etomoxir group). In in vivo experiments, the mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: Con group(Control group), mTg group (CBA/J mice were injected with mTg for modeling, that is EAT mice group), and mTg + ETO group (Etomoxir intervention in EAT mice group). Fatty acid oxidation substrates of CD4+T cells in human peripheral blood were detected by targeted metabolomics. The expressions of key fatty acid oxidation proteins mTOR, ACC1 and CPT1A were detected by Western blotting. The proportion of CD4+T cell subtype differentiation in human and mouse models was detected by flow cytometry. The severity of EAT was detected by HE staining. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the level of CPT1A in CD4+T cells of HT patients was increased, and the intracellular fatty acid content was significantly decreased, indicating that the level of fatty acid oxidation was enhanced in HT patients. After adding Etomoxir, the level of fatty acid oxidation was significantly inhibited, and the imbalance of CD4+T cell subpopulation differentiation in HT patients was reversed. In EAT mice, the mTOR/ACC1/CPT1A pathway was significantly activated, and its expression level was decreased after adding Etomoxir. At the same time, Etomoxir could reverse the reprogramming of abnormal metabolism in EAT mice cells, reduce the spleen index, and improve lymphocyte infiltration in the thyroid. CONCLUSIONS: The mTOR/ACC1/CPT1A fatty acid oxidation pathway of CD4+T cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis was increased, and treatment with Etomoxir could inhibit the activation of this pathway, and reverse the reprogramming of abnormal metabolism in CD4+T cells, thereby reducing Hashimoto's thyroiditis."

                "title": "Defining the optimum strategy for identifying adults and children with coeliac disease: systematic review and economic modelling.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingesting gluten. It affects approximately 1% of the UK population, but only one in three people is thought to have a diagnosis. Untreated coeliac disease may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis and lymphoma. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to define at-risk groups and determine the cost-effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in primary care. DESIGN: (1) Systematic review of the accuracy of potential diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease. (2) Routine data analysis to develop prediction models for identification of people who may benefit from testing for coeliac disease. (3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives. DATA SOURCES: For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE\u00ae (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA), Embase\u00ae (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library, Web of Science\u2122 (Clarivate\u2122, Philadelphia, PA, USA), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( WHO ICTRP ) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For the second systematic review, the following databases were searched from January 1990 to August 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews ( KSR ) Evidence, WHO ICTRP and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For prediction model development, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and a subcohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used; for estimates for the economic models, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum was used. REVIEW METHODS: For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed. RESULTS: People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (n\u2009=\u2009472) wanted to be 66% certain of the diagnosis from a blood test before starting a gluten-free diet if symptomatic, and 90% certain if asymptomatic. Cost-effectiveness analyses found that, among adults, and using serological testing alone, immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase was most cost-effective at a 1% pre-test probability (equivalent to population screening). Strategies using immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody plus human leucocyte antigen or human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability had similar cost-effectiveness results, which were also similar to the cost-effectiveness results of immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase at a 1% pre-test probability. The most practical alternative for implementation within the NHS is likely to be a combination of human leucocyte antigen and immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing among those with a pre-test probability above 1.5%. Among children, the most cost-effective strategy was a 10% pre-test probability with human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, but there was uncertainty around the most cost-effective pre-test probability. There was substantial uncertainty in economic model results, which means that there would be great value in conducting further research. LIMITATIONS: The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia). FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies. Large prospective cohort studies in which all participants receive accurate tests for coeliac disease are needed.

                "title": "Can a Liquid Biopsy Detect Circulating Tumor DNA With Low-passage Whole-genome Sequencing in Patients With a Sarcoma? A Pilot Evaluation.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A liquid biopsy is a test that evaluates the status of a disease by analyzing a sample of bodily fluid, most commonly blood. In recent years, there has been progress in the development and clinical application of liquid biopsy methods to identify blood-based, tumor-specific biomarkers for many cancer types. However, the implementation of these technologies to aid in the treatment of patients who have a sarcoma remains behind other fields of cancer medicine. For this study, we chose to evaluate a sarcoma liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). All human beings have normal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the blood. In contrast with cfDNA, ctDNA is genetic material present in the blood stream that is derived from a tumor. ctDNA carries the unique genomic fingerprint of the tumor with changes that are not present in normal circulating cfDNA. A successful ctDNA liquid biopsy must be able to target these tumor-specific genetic alterations. For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common in lung cancers, and ctDNA liquid biopsies are currently in clinical use to evaluate the status of disease in patients who have a lung cancer by detecting EGFR mutations in the blood. As opposed to many carcinomas, sarcomas do not have common recurrent mutations that could serve as the foundation to a ctDNA liquid biopsy. However, many sarcomas have structural changes to their chromosomes, including gains and losses of portions or entire chromosomes, known as copy number alterations (CNAs), that could serve as a target for a ctDNA liquid biopsy. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) amplification in select lipomatous tumors or parosteal osteosarcoma is an example of a CNA due to the presence of extra copies of a segment of the long arm of chromosome 12. Since a majority of sarcomas demonstrate a complex karyotype with numerous CNAs, a blood-based liquid biopsy strategy that searches for these CNAs may be able to detect the presence of sarcoma ctDNA. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a next-generation sequencing technique that evaluates the entire genome. The depth of coverage of WGS refers to how detailed the sequencing is, like higher versus lower power on a microscope. WGS can be performed with high-depth sequencing (that is, > 60\u00d7), which can detect individual point mutations, or low-depth sequencing (that is, 0.1\u00d7 to 5\u00d7), referred to as low-passage whole-genome sequencing (LP-WGS), which may not detect individual mutations but can detect structural chromosomal changes including gains and losses (that is, CNAs). While similar strategies have shown favorable early results for specific sarcoma subtypes, LP-WGS has not been evaluated for applicability to the broader population of patients who have a sarcoma. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Does an LP-WGS liquid biopsy evaluating for CNAs detect ctDNA in plasma samples from patients who have sarcomas representing a variety of histologic subtypes? METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted at a community-based, tertiary referral center. Nine paired (plasma and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue) and four unpaired (plasma) specimens from patients who had a sarcoma were obtained from a commercial biospecimen bank. Three control specimens from individuals who did not have cancer were also obtained. The paired and unpaired specimens from patients who had a sarcoma represented a variety of sarcoma histologic subtypes. cfDNA was extracted, amplified, and quantified. Libraries were prepared, and LP-WGS was performed using a NextSeq 500 next-generation sequencing machine at a low depth of sequencing coverage (\u223c1\u00d7). The ichorCNA bioinformatics algorithm, which was designed to detect CNAs from low-depth genomic sequencing data, was used to analyze the data. In contrast with the gold standard for diagnosis in the form of histopathologic analysis of a tissue sample, this test does not discriminate between sarcoma subtypes but detects the presence of tumor-derived CNAs within the ctDNA in the blood that should not be present in a patient who does not have cancer. The liquid biopsy was positive for the detection of cancer if the ichorCNA algorithm detected the presence of ctDNA. The algorithm was also used to quantitatively estimate the percent ctDNA within the cfDNA. The concentration of ctDNA was then calculated from the percent ctDNA relative to the total concentration of cfDNA. The CNAs of the paired FFPE tissue and plasma samples were graphically visualized using aCNViewer software. RESULTS: This LP-WGS liquid biopsy detected ctDNA in 9 of 13 of the plasma specimens from patients with a sarcoma. The other four samples from patients with a sarcoma and all serum specimens from patients without cancer had no detectable ctDNA. Of those 9 patients with positive liquid biopsy results, the percent ctDNA ranged from 6% to 11%, and calculated ctDNA quantities were 0.04 to 5.6 ng/mL, which are levels to be expected when ctDNA is detectable. CONCLUSION: In this small pilot study, we were able to detect sarcoma ctDNA with an LP-WGS liquid biopsy searching for CNAs in the plasma of most patients who had a sarcoma representing a variety of histologic subtypes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results suggest that an LP-WGS liquid biopsy evaluating for CNAs to identify ctDNA may be more broadly applicable to the population of patients who have a sarcoma than previously reported in studies focusing on specific subtypes. Large prospective clinical trials that gather samples at multiple time points during the process of diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance will be needed to further assess whether this technique can be clinically useful. At our institution, we are in the process of developing a large prospective clinical trial for this purpose."

                "title": "Comparison of Two Modern Survival Prediction Tools, SORG-MLA and METSSS, in Patients With Symptomatic Long-bone Metastases Who Underwent Local Treatment With Surgery Followed by Radiotherapy and With Radiotherapy Alone.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Survival estimation for patients with symptomatic skeletal metastases ideally should be made before a type of local treatment has already been determined. Currently available survival prediction tools, however, were generated using data from patients treated either operatively or with local radiation alone, raising concerns about whether they would generalize well to all patients presenting for assessment. The Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithm (SORG-MLA), trained with institution-based data of surgically treated patients, and the Metastases location, Elderly, Tumor primary, Sex, Sickness/comorbidity, and Site of radiotherapy model (METSSS), trained with registry-based data of patients treated with radiotherapy alone, are two of the most recently developed survival prediction models, but they have not been tested on patients whose local treatment strategy is not yet decided. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which of these two survival prediction models performed better in a mixed cohort made up both of patients who received local treatment with surgery followed by radiotherapy and who had radiation alone for symptomatic bone metastases? (2) Which model performed better among patients whose local treatment consisted of only palliative radiotherapy? (3) Are laboratory values used by SORG-MLA, which are not included in METSSS, independently associated with survival after controlling for predictions made by METSSS? METHODS: Between 2010 and 2018, we provided local treatment for 2113 adult patients with skeletal metastases in the extremities at an urban tertiary referral academic medical center using one of two strategies: (1) surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy or (2) palliative radiotherapy alone. Every patient's survivorship status was ascertained either by their medical records or the national death registry from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration. After applying a priori designated exclusion criteria, 91% (1920) were analyzed here. Among them, 48% (920) of the patients were female, and the median (IQR) age was 62 years (53 to 70 years). Lung was the most common primary tumor site (41% [782]), and 59% (1128) of patients had other skeletal metastases in addition to the treated lesion(s). In general, the indications for surgery were the presence of a complete pathologic fracture or an impending pathologic fracture, defined as having a Mirels score of \u2265 9, in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of less than or equal to IV and who were considered fit for surgery. The indications for radiotherapy were relief of pain, local tumor control, prevention of skeletal-related events, and any combination of the above. In all, 84% (1610) of the patients received palliative radiotherapy alone as local treatment for the target lesion(s), and 16% (310) underwent surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Neither METSSS nor SORG-MLA was used at the point of care to aid clinical decision-making during the treatment period. Survival was retrospectively estimated by these two models to test their potential for providing survival probabilities. We first compared SORG to METSSS in the entire population. Then, we repeated the comparison in patients who received local treatment with palliative radiation alone. We assessed model performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration analysis, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUROC measures discrimination, which is the ability to distinguish patients with the event of interest (such as death at a particular time point) from those without. AUROC typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating random guessing and 1.0 a perfect prediction, and in general, an AUROC of \u2265 0.7 indicates adequate discrimination for clinical use. Calibration refers to the agreement between the predicted outcomes (in this case, survival probabilities) and the actual outcomes, with a perfect calibration curve having an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1. A positive intercept indicates that the actual survival is generally underestimated by the prediction model, and a negative intercept suggests the opposite (overestimation). When comparing models, an intercept closer to 0 typically indicates better calibration. Calibration can also be summarized as log(O:E), the logarithm scale of the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) survivors. A log(O:E) > 0 signals an underestimation (the observed survival is greater than the predicted survival); and a log(O:E) < 0 indicates the opposite (the observed survival is lower than the predicted survival). A model with a log(O:E) closer to 0 is generally considered better calibrated. The Brier score is the mean squared difference between the model predictions and the observed outcomes, and it ranges from 0 (best prediction) to 1 (worst prediction). The Brier score captures both discrimination and calibration, and it is considered a measure of overall model performance. In Brier score analysis, the \"null model\" assigns a predicted probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome and represents a model that adds no new information. A prediction model should achieve a Brier score at least lower than the null-model Brier score to be considered as useful. The DCA was developed as a method to determine whether using a model to inform treatment decisions would do more good than harm. It plots the net benefit of making decisions based on the model's predictions across all possible risk thresholds (or cost-to-benefit ratios) in relation to the two default strategies of treating all or no patients. The care provider can decide on an acceptable risk threshold for the proposed treatment in an individual and assess the corresponding net benefit to determine whether consulting with the model is superior to adopting the default strategies. Finally, we examined whether laboratory data, which were not included in the METSSS model, would have been independently associated with survival after controlling for the METSSS model's predictions by using the multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: Between the two models, only SORG-MLA achieved adequate discrimination (an AUROC of > 0.7) in the entire cohort (of patients treated operatively or with radiation alone) and in the subgroup of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy alone. SORG-MLA outperformed METSSS by a wide margin on discrimination, calibration, and Brier score analyses in not only the entire cohort but also the subgroup of patients whose local treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone. In both the entire cohort and the subgroup, DCA demonstrated that SORG-MLA provided more net benefit compared with the two default strategies (of treating all or no patients) and compared with METSSS when risk thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 at both 90 days and 1 year, indicating that using SORG-MLA as a decision-making aid was beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting for treatment was 0.2 to 0.9. Higher albumin, lower alkaline phosphatase, lower calcium, higher hemoglobin, lower international normalized ratio, higher lymphocytes, lower neutrophils, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, higher sodium, and lower white blood cells were independently associated with better 1-year and overall survival after adjusting for the predictions made by METSSS. CONCLUSION: Based on these discoveries, clinicians might choose to consult SORG-MLA instead of METSSS for survival estimation in patients with long-bone metastases presenting for evaluation of local treatment. Basing a treatment decision on the predictions of SORG-MLA could be beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting to undergo a particular treatment strategy ranged from 0.2 to 0.9. Future studies might investigate relevant laboratory items when constructing or refining a survival estimation model because these data demonstrated prognostic value independent of the predictions of the METSSS model, and future studies might also seek to keep these models up to date using data from diverse, contemporary patients undergoing both modern operative and nonoperative treatments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, diagnostic study."

We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin."

                "abstract": "QUESTIONS: In patients with multiple myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, or lymphoma, what is the efficacy of bortezomib alone or in combination as measured by survival, quality of life, disease control (for example, time to progression), response duration, or response rate?What is the toxicity associated with the use of bortezomib?Which patients are more or less likely to benefit from treatment with bortezomib? PERSPECTIVES: Evidence was selected and reviewed by two members of the Hematology Disease Site Group and by methodologists from the Program in Evidence-based Care (pebc) at Cancer Care Ontario. The practice guideline report was reviewed and approved by the Hematology Disease Site Group, which comprises hematologists, medical and radiation oncologists, and a patient representative. As part of an external review process, the report was disseminated to practitioners throughout Ontario to obtain their feedback. OUTCOMES: Outcomes of interest were overall survival, quality of life, response rates and duration, and rates of adverse events. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was conducted of the medline, embase, HealthStar, cinahl, and Cochrane Library databases for primary articles and practice guidelines. The resulting evidence informed the development of clinical practice recommendations. Those recommendations were appraised by a sample of practitioners in Ontario and modified in response to the feedback received. The systematic review and modified recommendations were approved by a review body w theithin pebc. RESULTS: The literature review found one randomized controlled trial (rct)-the only published rct of bortezomib in relapsed myeloma. A number of phase ii studies were also retrieved, including a randomized phase ii study. No randomized trials were retrieved for lymphoma. The rct found bortezomib to be superior to high-dose dexamethasone for median time to progression and 1-year survival in patients with relapsed myeloma, although grade 3 adverse events were more common in the bortezomib arm. Bortezomib is recommended as the preferred treatment option in patients with myeloma relapsing within 1 year of the conclusion of initial treatment; it may also be a reasonable option in patients relapsing at least 1 year after autologous stem-cell transplantation. PRACTICE GUIDELINE: This evidence-based series applies to adult patients with myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, or lymphoma of any type, stage, histology, or performance status. RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on the results of a large well-conducted rct, which represents the only published randomized study in relapsed myeloma, the Hematology Disease Site Group (dsg) offers the following recommendations: For patients with myeloma refractory to or relapsing within 1 year of the conclusion of initial or subsequent treatment or treatments, including autologous stem-cell transplantation, and who are candidates for further chemotherapy, bortezomib is recommended as the preferred treatment option.Bortezomib is also a reasonable option for patients relapsing at least 1 year after autologous stem-cell transplantation. The dsg is aware that thalidomide, alkylating agents, or repeat transplantation may also be options for these patients. However, evaluation of these other options is beyond the scope of this practice guideline.For patients with myeloma relapsing at least 1 year after the conclusion of alkylating agent-based chemotherapy who are candidates for further chemotherapy, further treatment with alkylating agent-based chemotherapy is recommended.Evidence is insufficient to support the use of bortezomib in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia outside of clinical trials. QUALIFYING STATEMENTS: Limited evidence supports the appropriateness of a specific time-to-relapse period as being indicative of treatment-insensitive disease. The 1-year threshold provided in the foregoing recommendations is based on the opinion of the Hematology dsg. For specific details related to the administration of bortezomib therapy, the dsg suggests that clinicians refer to the protocols used in major trials. Some of those details are provided here for informational purposes. DOSAGE: Bortezomib 1.3,g/m(2) is given as a rapid intravenous bolus over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle; a minimum of 72 hours between doses is required to allow for recovery of normal proteasome function. Vital signs should be checked before and after each dose. A complete blood count is recommended before each dose, with blood chemistries (including electrolyte and creatinine levels) monitored at a minimum on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. The dose of bortezomib should be reduced or held immediately upon development of painful neuropathy, as described in the product monograph; dose modification may also be required for peripheral sensory neuropathy without pain or for other toxicities. Most toxicities are reversible if dose modification guidelines are followed.  RESPONSE TO TREATMENT: Responses are usually apparent by 6 weeks (2 cycles). For patients achieving complete remission (determined by negative electrophoresis and immunofixation), bortezomib should be given for 2 additional cycles beyond the date of confirmed complete remission. In patients with progressive disease after 2 cycles or stable disease after 4 cycles, dexamethasone added to the bortezomib regimen (20 mg by mouth the day of and the day after each bortezomib dose) may produce an objective response. Bortezomib (with or without dexamethasone) should be continued in patients showing benefit from therapy (excluding those in complete remission) unless disease progression or significant toxicity is observed. Therapy should be discontinued in patients who do not respond to bortezomib alone if disease progression is seen within 2 cycles of the addition of dexamethasone. The Hematology dsg recognizes that thalidomide is an active agent in multiple myeloma patients who have relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation or who are refractory to alkylating agent-based chemotherapy. To date, no reported rcts have evaluated thalidomide in this role, and specifically, no trials have compared thalidomide with bortezomib. Given these limitations, the members of the Hematology dsg regard thalidomide or bortezomib as therapy alternatives to dexamethasone."

                "abstract": "Background: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin condition. One of the most common skin disorders in children, atopic dermatitis typically manifests before the age of 5 years, but it can develop at any age. Atopic dermatitis is characterised by dry, inflamed skin accompanied by intense itchiness (pruritus). Objectives: To appraise the clinical and cost effectiveness of abrocitinib, tralokinumab and upadacitinib within their marketing authorisations as alternative therapies for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis compared to systemic immunosuppressants (first-line ciclosporin A or second-line dupilumab and baricitinib). Data sources: Studies were identified from an existing systematic review (search date 2019) and update searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) to November 2021, from bibliographies of retrieved studies, clinical trial registers and evidence provided by the sponsoring companies of the treatments under review. Methods: A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature was carried out and a network meta-analysis undertaken for adults and adolescents at different steps of the treatment pathway. The primary outcome of interest was a combined response of Eczema Area and Severity Index 50 + Dermatology Life Quality Index \u2265 4; where this was consistently unavailable for a step in the pathway, an analysis of Eczema Area and Severity Index 75 was conducted. A de novo economic model was developed to assess cost effectiveness from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. The model structure was informed through systematic review of the economic literature and by consulting clinical experts. Effectiveness data were obtained from the network meta-analysis. Costs and utilities were obtained from the evidence provided by sponsoring companies and standard UK sources. Results: Network meta-analyses indicate that abrocitinib 200 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg may be more effective, and tralokinumab may be less effective than dupilumab and baricitinib as second-line systemic therapies. Abrocitinib 100 mg and upadacitinib 15 mg have a more similar effectiveness to dupilumab. Upadacitinib 30 and 15 mg are likely to be more effective than ciclosporin A as a first-line therapy. Upadacitinib 15 mg, abrocitinib 200 and 100 mg may be more effective than dupilumab in adolescents. The cost effectiveness of abrocitinib and upadacitinib for both doses is dependent on the subgroup of interest. Tralokinumab can be considered cost-effective as a second-line systemic therapy owing to greater cost savings per quality-adjusted life-year lost. Conclusions: The primary strength of the analysis of the three new drugs compared with current practice for each of the subpopulations is the consistent approach to the assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness. However, the conclusions are limited by the high uncertainty around the clinical effectiveness and lack of data for the primary outcome for comparisons with baricitinib and for the adolescent and adult first-line populations. Future work and limitations: The most significant limitation that Eczema Area and Severity Index 50\u2005+\u2005Dermatology Life Quality Index\u2005\u2265\u20054 could not be obtained for the adolescent and adult first-line systemic treatment populations is due to a paucity of data for dupilumab and ciclosporin A. A comparison of the new drugs against one another in addition to current practice would be beneficial to provide a robust view on which treatments are the most cost-effective.

                "abstract": "To investigate the effect of Buzhong Yiqi Decoction on regulatory T cells(Treg) in experimental rats with autoimmune thyroiditis(EAT) through the transforming growth factor-\u03b2(TGF-\u03b2)/Smad signaling pathway. Female SD rats were immunized with iodine-rich drinking water combined with Freund's adjuvant and porcine thyroglobulin(pTG) to establish the EAT model of rats, and the levels of serum thyroperoxidase antibody(TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody(TGAb) were detected. Pathological sections by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining were observed. Treg in the rats' spleen were extracted by immunomagnetic beads after the successful modeling and identified by flow cytometry. The extracted Treg were divided into blank group, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction group, TGF-\u03b2 group, antagonist(LY3200882), and antagonist(LY3200882)+Buzhong Yiqi Decoction group. After the intervention, the cell counting kit-8(CCK-8) experiment was conducted to detect cell viability. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR(RT-qPCR) were used to detect the expression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway-related proteins and genes. The results showed that the levels of TPOAb and TGAb increased in the rats in the model group compared to the rats in the blank group. HE staining showed that part of the follicles in the thyroid tissue of the rats in the model group were destroyed, and a large number of lymphocytes were infiltrated, indicating that the modeling was successful. After Treg were administered in vitro, CCK-8 results showed that the serum concentration of Buzhong Yiqi Decoction was below 40% to promote cell proliferation. The Buzhong Yiqi Decoction-containing serum group could increase the protein expression of TGF-\u03b21, FoxP3, Smad2, and Smad4 compared with the blank serum group, while the expression of p-Smad2, p-Smad3, and Smad3 increased compared with the blank serum group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Compared with the antagonist group, the protein expressions of p-Smad2, Smad2, p-Smad3, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 did not significantly increase or decrease in the antagonist group after adding Buzhong Yiqi Decoction-containing serum. RT-qPCR showed that compared with the blank serum group, the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21, FoxP3, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 in the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction group increased or decreased in the same trend as that in the TGF-\u03b2 group, but there was no statistical significance. After Buzhong Yiqi Decoction-containing serum was added to the antagonist group, the mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21, FoxP3, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 were not statistically significant. In conclusion, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction could promote the stability and activity of Treg cells by promoting the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 and regulating the expression of key signaling molecules TGF-\u03b21, Smad2, and Smad4 in the TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway, thus affecting the immune balance of Th17/Treg and inhibiting the inflammatory response of rats with EAT."

                "title": "Genedrive kit for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism m.1555A>G in neonates and their mothers: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.",
                "abstract": "Background: Neonates with suspected sepsis are commonly treated with gentamicin, an aminoglycoside. These antibiotics are associated with high risk of ototoxicity, including profound bilateral deafness, in people with the m.1555A>G mitochondrial genetic variant. Objective: This early value assessment summarised and critically assessed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the gene m.1555A>G variant in neonates and mothers of neonates needing antibiotics or anticipated to need antibiotics. Following feedback from the scoping workshop and specialist assessment subgroup meeting, we also considered the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the m.1555A>G variant in mothers prior to giving birth. Data sources: For clinical effectiveness, we searched three major databases in October 2022: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). For cost-effectiveness, in addition to the three mentioned databases we searched Cochrane and RePEc-IDEAS. Study selection: Study selection and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers (Ryan PW Kenny and Akvile Stoniute for clinical effectiveness and Hosein Shabaninejad and Tomos Robinson for cost-effectiveness). Any differences were resolved through discussion, or by a third reviewer (Nick Meader). Study appraisal: Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. One study (n\u2005=\u2005751 neonates recruited) was included in the clinical effectiveness review and no studies were included in the cost-effectiveness review. All except one outcome (test failure rate: low risk of bias) were rated as being at moderate risk of bias. The study reported accuracy of the test (sensitivity 100%, 95% confidence interval 29.2% to 100%; specificity 99.2%, 95% confidence interval 98% to 99.7%), number of neonates successfully tested (n\u2005=\u2005424/526 admissions), test failure rate (17.1%, although this was reduced to 5.7%), impact on antibiotic use (all those with a m.1555A>G genotype avoided aminoglycosides), time taken to obtain a sample (6 minutes), time to genotyping (26 minutes), time to antibiotic treatment (55.18 minutes) and the number of neonates with m.1555A>G (n\u2005=\u20053). Limitations: The economic component of this work identified key evidence gaps for which further data are required before a robust economic evaluation can be conducted. These include the sensitivity of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit for identifying the gene m.1555A>G variant in neonates, the magnitude of risk for aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in neonates with m.1555A>G, and the prevalence of the m.1555A>G variant. Other potentially important gaps include how data regarding maternal inheritance may potentially be used in the clinical pathway. Conclusions: This early value assessment suggests that the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit has the potential to identify the m.1555A>G variant and to be cost-effective. The Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit dominates the current standard of care over the lifetime, as it is less costly and more effective. For a 50-year time horizon, the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit was also the dominant strategy. For a 10-year time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be \u00a3103 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Nevertheless, as anticipated, there is insufficient evidence to conduct a full diagnostic assessment of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Genedrive MT-RNR1 ID Kit in neonates directly or in their mothers. This report includes a list of research priorities to reduce the uncertainty around this early value assessment and to provide the additional data needed to inform a full diagnostic assessment, including cost-effectiveness modelling.

                "title": "Impact of residual disease as a prognostic factor for survival in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer after primary surgery.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer among women and a leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type, accounting for around 90% of all ovarian cancers. This specific type of ovarian cancer starts in the surface layer covering the ovary or lining of the fallopian tube. Surgery is performed either before chemotherapy (upfront or primary debulking surgery (PDS)) or in the middle of a course of treatment with chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval debulking surgery (IDS)), with the aim of removing all visible tumour and achieving no macroscopic residual disease (NMRD). The aim of this review is to investigate the prognostic impact of size of residual disease nodules (RD) in women who received upfront or interval cytoreductive surgery for advanced (stage III and IV) epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognostic impact of residual disease after primary surgery on survival outcomes for advanced (stage III and IV) epithelial ovarian cancer. In separate analyses, primary surgery included both upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). Each residual disease threshold is considered as a separate prognostic factor. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 8), MEDLINE via Ovid (to 30 August 2021) and Embase via Ovid (to 30 August 2021). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included survival data from studies of at least 100 women with advanced EOC after primary surgery. Residual disease was assessed as a prognostic factor in multivariate prognostic models. We excluded studies that reported fewer than 100 women, women with concurrent malignancies or studies that only reported unadjusted results. Women were included into two distinct groups: those who received PDS followed by platinum-based chemotherapy and those who received IDS, analysed separately. We included studies that reported all RD thresholds after surgery, but the main thresholds of interest were microscopic RD (labelled NMRD), RD 0.1 cm to 1 cm (small-volume residual disease (SVRD)) and RD > 1 cm (large-volume residual disease (LVRD)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we synthesised the data in meta-analysis. To assess the adequacy of adjustment factors used in multivariate Cox models, we used the 'adjustment for other prognostic factors' and 'statistical analysis and reporting' domains of the quality in prognosis studies (QUIPS) tool. We also made judgements about the certainty of the evidence for each outcome in the main comparisons, using GRADE. We examined differences between FIGO stages III and IV for different thresholds of RD after primary surgery. We considered factors such as age, grade, length of follow-up, type and experience of surgeon, and type of surgery in the interpretation of any heterogeneity. We also performed sensitivity analyses that distinguished between studies that included NMRD in RD categories of < 1 cm and those that did not. This was applicable to comparisons involving RD < 1 cm with the exception of RD < 1 cm versus NMRD. We evaluated women undergoing PDS and IDS in separate analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We found 46 studies reporting multivariate prognostic analyses, including RD as a prognostic factor, which met our inclusion criteria: 22,376 women who underwent PDS and 3697 who underwent IDS, all with varying levels of RD. While we identified a range of different RD thresholds, we mainly report on comparisons that are the focus of a key area of clinical uncertainty (involving NMRD, SVRD and LVRD). The comparison involving any visible disease (RD > 0 cm) and NMRD was also important. SVRD versus NMRD in a PDS setting In PDS studies, most showed an increased risk of death in all RD groups when those with macroscopic RD (MRD) were compared to NMRD. Women who had SVRD after PDS had more than twice the risk of death compared to women with NMRD (hazard ratio (HR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 2.29; I2 = 50%; 17 studies; 9404 participants; moderate-certainty). The analysis of progression-free survival found that women who had SVRD after PDS had nearly twice the risk of death compared to women with NMRD (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.16; I2 = 63%; 10 studies; 6596 participants; moderate-certainty). LVRD versus SVRD in a PDS setting When we compared LVRD versus SVRD following surgery, the estimates were attenuated compared to NMRD comparisons. All analyses showed an overall survival benefit in women who had RD < 1 cm after surgery (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.32; I2 = 0%; 5 studies; 6000 participants; moderate-certainty). The results were robust to analyses of progression-free survival. SVRD and LVRD versus NMRD in an IDS setting The one study that defined the categories as NMRD, SVRD and LVRD showed that women who had SVRD and LVRD after IDS had more than twice the risk of death compared to women who had NMRD (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.66; 310 participants; I2 = 56%, and HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.34; 343 participants; I2 = 35%; very low-certainty, for SVRD versus NMRD and LVRD versus NMRD, respectively). LVRD versus SVRD + NMRD in an IDS setting Meta-analysis found that women who had LVRD had a greater risk of death and disease progression compared to women who had either SVRD or NMRD (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.11; 6 studies; 1572 participants; I2 = 58% for overall survival and HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.52; 1145 participants; I2 = 60% for progression-free survival; very low-certainty). However, this result is biased as in all but one study it was not possible to distinguish NMRD within the < 1 cm thresholds. Only one study separated NMRD from SVRD; all others included NMRD in the SVRD group, which may create bias when comparing with LVRD, making interpretation challenging. MRD versus NMRD in an IDS setting Women who had any amount of MRD after IDS had more than twice the risk of death compared to women with NMRD (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.29, I2 = 81%; 906 participants; very low-certainty). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In a PDS setting, there is moderate-certainty evidence that the amount of RD after primary surgery is a prognostic factor for overall and progression-free survival in women with advanced ovarian cancer. We separated our analysis into three distinct categories for the survival outcome including NMRD, SVRD and LVRD. After IDS, there may be only two categories required, although this is based on very low-certainty evidence, as all but one study included NMRD in the SVRD category. The one study that separated NMRD from SVRD showed no improved survival outcome in the SVRD category, compared to LVRD. Further low-certainty evidence also supported restricting to two categories, where women who had any amount of MRD after IDS had a significantly greater risk of death compared to women with NMRD. Therefore, the evidence presented in this review cannot conclude that using three categories applies in an IDS setting (very low-certainty evidence), as was supported for PDS (which has convincing moderate-certainty evidence)."

                "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers."

                "title": "Enabling Systemic Identification and Functionality Profiling for Cdc42 Homeostatic Modulators.",
                "abstract": "Homeostatic modulation is pivotal in modern therapeutics. However, the discovery of bioactive materials to achieve this functionality is often random and unpredictive. Here, we enabled a systemic identification and functional classification of chemicals that elicit homeostatic modulation of signaling through Cdc42, a classical small GTPase of Ras superfamily. Rationally designed for high throughput screening, the capture of homeostatic modulators (HMs) along with molecular re-docking uncovered at least five functionally distinct classes of small molecules. This enabling led to partial agonists, hormetic agonists, bona fide activators and inhibitors, and ligand-enhanced agonists. Novel HMs exerted striking functionality in bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin remodelingand modified Alzheimer's disease-like behavior in mouse model. This concurrent computer-aided and experimentally empowered HM profiling highlights a model path for predicting HM landscape. One Sentence Summary: With concurrent experimental biochemical profiling and in silico computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) analysis, this study enabled a systemic identification and holistic classification of Cdc42 homeostatic modulators (HMs) and demonstrated the power of CADD to predict HM classes that can mimic the pharmacological functionality of interests. Introduction: Maintainingbody homeostasisis the ultimate keyto health. Thereare rich resources of bioactive materials for this functionality from both natural and synthetic chemical repertories including partial agonists (PAs) and various allosteric modulators. These homeostatic modulators (HMs) play a unique role in modern therapeutics for human diseases such as mental disorders and drug addiction. Buspirone, for example, acts as a PA for serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor but is an antagonist of the dopamine D 2 receptor. Such medical useto treat general anxietydisorders (GADs) has become one of the most-commonly prescribed medications. However, most HMs in current uses target membrane proteins and are often derived from random discoveries. HMs as therapeutics targeting cytoplasmic proteins are even more rare despite that they are in paramount needs (e. g. targeting Ras superfamily small GTPases). Rationale: Cdc42, a classical member of small GTPases of Ras superfamily, regulates PI3K-AKT and Raf-MEK-ERK pathways and has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and mental disorders as well as addictive diseases and cancer. We previously reported the high-throughput in-silico screening followed by biological characterization of novel small molecule modulators (SMMs) of Cdc42-intersectin (ITSN) protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Based on a serendipitously discovered SMM ZCL278 with PA profile as a model compound, we hypothesized that there are more varieties of such HMs of Cdc42 signaling, and the model HMs can be defined by their distinct Cdc42-ITSN binding mechanisms using computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) analysis. We further reasoned that molecular modeling coupled with experimental profiling can predict HM spectrum and thus open the door for the holistic identification and classification of multifunctional cytoplasmic target-dependent HMs as therapeutics. Results: The originally discovered Cdc42 inhibitor ZCL278 displaying PA properties prompted the inquiry whether this finding represented a random encounter of PAs or whether biologically significant PAs can be widely present. The top ranked compounds were initially defined by structural fitness and binding scores to Cdc42. Because higher binding scores do not necessarily translate to higher functionality, we performed exhaustive experimentations with over 2,500 independent Cdc42-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) assays to profile the GTP loading activities on all 44 top ranked compounds derived from the SMM library. The N-MAR-GTP fluorophore-based Cdc42-GEF assay platform provided the first glimpse of the breadth of HMs. A spectrum of Cdc42 HMs was uncovered that can be categorized into five functionally distinct classes: Class I-partial competitive agonists, Class II-hormetic agonists, Class III- bona fide inhibitors (or inverse agonists), Class IV- bona fide activators or agonists, and Class V-ligand-enhanced agonists. Remarkably, model HMs such as ZCL278, ZCL279, and ZCL367 elicited striking biological functionality in bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin remodeling and modified Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavior in mouse model. Concurrently, we applied Schr\u00f6dinger-enabled analyses to perform CADD predicted classification of Cdc42 HMs. We modified the classic molecular docking to instill a preferential binding pocket order (PBPO) of Cdc42-ITSN, which was based on the five binding pockets in interface of Cdc42-ITSN. We additionally applied a structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis generation for the model compounds. Then, using Schr\u00f6dinger's Phase Shape, 3D ligand alignments assigned HMs to Class I, II, III, IV, and V compounds. In this HM library compounds, PBPO, matching pharmacophoric featuring, and shape alignment, all put ZCL993 in Class II compound category, which was confirmed in the Cdc42-GEF assay. Conclusion: HMs can target diseased cells or tissues while minimizing impacts on tissues that are unaffected. Using Cdc42 HM model compounds as a steppingstone, GTPase activation-based screening of SMM library uncovered five functionally distinct Cdc42 HM classes among which novel efficacies towards alleviating dysregulated AD-like features in mice were identified. Furthermore, molecular re-docking of HM model compounds led to the concept of PBPO. The CADD analysis with PBPO revealed similar profile in a color-coded spectrum to these five distinct classes of Cdc42 HMs identified by biochemical functionality-based screening. The current study enabled a systemic identification and holistic classification of Cdc42 HMs and demonstrated the power of CADD to predict an HM category that can mimic the pharmacological functionality of interests. With artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) on the horizon to mirror experimental pharmacological discovery like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, our study highlights a model path to actively capture and profile HMs in potentially any PPI landscape. Graphic Abstract:  Identification and functional classification of Cdc42 homeostatic modulators HMs: Using Cdc42 HM model compounds as reference, GTPase activation-based screening of compound libraries uncovered five functionally distinct Cdc42 HM classes. HMs showed novel efficacies towards alleviating dysregulated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavioral and molecular deficits. In parallel, molecular re-docking of HM model compounds established their preferential binding pocket orders (PBPO). PBPO-based profiling (Red reflects the most, whereas green reflects the least, preferable binding pocket) revealed trends of similar pattern to the five classes from the functionality-based classification."

                "title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-traumatic stress disorder in adults.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The estimated lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults worldwide has been estimated at 3.9%. PTSD appears to contribute to alterations in neuronal network connectivity patterns. Current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are associated with inadequate symptom improvement and high dropout rates. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive therapy involving induction of electrical currents in cortical brain tissue, may be an important treatment option for PTSD to improve remission rates and for people who cannot tolerate existing treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two clinical trials registers. We checked reference lists of relevant articles. The most recent search was January 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of rTMS versus sham rTMS for PTSD in adults from any treatment setting, including veterans. Eligible trials employed at least five rTMS treatment sessions with both active and sham conditions. We included trials with combination interventions, where a pharmacological agent or psychotherapy was combined with rTMS for both intervention and control groups. We included studies meeting the above criteria regardless of whether they reported any of our outcomes of interest. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane standards. Primary outcomes were PTSD severity immediately after treatment and serious adverse events during active treatment. Secondary outcomes were PTSD remission, PTSD response, PTSD severity at two follow-up time points after treatment, dropouts, and depression and anxiety severity immediately after treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs in the review (12 published; 1 unpublished dissertation), with 577 participants. Eight studies included stand-alone rTMS treatment, four combined rTMS with an evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment, and one investigated rTMS as an adjunctive to treatment-as-usual. Five studies were conducted in the USA, and some predominantly included white, male veterans. Active rTMS probably makes little to no difference to PTSD severity immediately following treatment (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.54 to 0.27; 3 studies, 99 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence by one level for imprecision (sample size insufficient to detect a difference of medium effect size). We deemed one study as having a low risk of bias and the remaining two as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias. A sensitivity analysis of change-from-baseline scores enabled inclusion of a greater number of studies (6 studies, 252 participants). This analysis yielded a similar outcome to our main analysis but also indicated significant heterogeneity in efficacy across studies, including two studies with a high risk of bias. Reported rates of serious adverse events were low, with seven reported (active rTMS: 6; sham rTMS: 1). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of active rTMS on serious adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 5.26, 95% CI 0.26 to 107.81; 5 studies, 251 participants; very low-certainty evidence [Active rTMS: 23/1000, sham rTMS: 4/1000]). We downgraded the evidence by one level for risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. We rated four of five studies as having a high risk of bias, and the fifth as 'some concerns' for bias. We were unable to assess PTSD remission immediately after treatment as none of the included studies reported this outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on moderate-certainty evidence, our review suggests that active rTMS probably makes little to no difference to PTSD severity immediately following treatment compared to sham stimulation. However, significant heterogeneity in efficacy was detected when we included a larger number of studies in sensitivity analysis. We observed considerable variety in participant and protocol characteristics across studies included in this review. For example, studies tended to be weighted towards inclusion of either male veterans or female civilians. Studies varied greatly in terms of the proportion of the sample with comorbid depression. Study protocols differed in treatment design and stimulation parameters (e.g. session number/duration, treatment course length, stimulation intensity/frequency, location of stimulation). These differences may affect efficacy, particularly when considering interactions with participant factors. Reported rates of serious adverse events were very low (< 1%) across active and sham conditions. It is uncertain whether rTMS increases the risk of serious adverse event occurrence, as our certainty of evidence was very low. Studies frequently lacked clear definitions for serious adverse events, as well as detail on tracking/assessment of data and information on the safety population. Increased reporting on these elements would likely aid the advancement of both research and clinical recommendations of rTMS for PTSD. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to meta-analyze PTSD remission, PTSD treatment response, and PTSD severity at different periods post-treatment. Further research into these outcomes could inform the clinical use of rTMS. Additionally, the relatively large contribution of data from trials that focused on white male veterans may limit the generalizability of our conclusions. This could be addressed by prioritizing recruitment of more diverse participant samples."

                "title": "Workplace interventions to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of healthcare settings.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) experience no or mild symptoms, some individuals can develop severe illness and may die, particularly older people and those with underlying medical problems. Providing evidence-based interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection has become more urgent with the potential psychological toll imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is the fundamental method of protecting workers. When it comes to the transmission of viruses, workplaces should first consider control measures that can potentially have the most significant impact. According to the hierarchy of controls, one should first consider elimination (and substitution), then engineering controls, administrative controls, and lastly, personal protective equipment. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published 6 May 2022, with one new study added. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of interventions in non-healthcare-related workplaces aimed at reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other interventions or no intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collections, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv to 13 April 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions. We included adult workers, both those who come into close contact with clients or customers (e.g. public-facing employees, such as cashiers or taxi drivers), and those who do not, but who could be infected by coworkers. We excluded studies involving healthcare workers. We included any intervention to prevent or reduce workers' exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace, defining categories of intervention according to the hierarchy of hazard controls (i.e. elimination; engineering controls; administrative controls; personal protective equipment). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (or other respiratory viruses), SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, adverse events, and absenteeism from work. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, quality of life, hospitalisation, and uptake, acceptability, or adherence to strategies. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias, and GRADE methods to evaluate the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 2 studies including a total of 16,014 participants. Elimination-of-exposure interventions We included one study examining an intervention that focused on elimination of hazards, which was an open-label, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority trial, conducted in England in 2021. The study compared standard 10-day self-isolation after contact with an infected person to a new strategy of daily rapid antigen testing and staying at work if the test is negative (test-based attendance). The trialists hypothesised that this would lead to a similar rate of infections, but lower COVID-related absence. Staff (N = 11,798) working at 76 schools were assigned to standard isolation, and staff (N = 12,229) working at 86 schools were assigned to the test-based attendance strategy. The results between test-based attendance and standard 10-day self-isolation were inconclusive for the rate of symptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (rate ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.21; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The results between test-based attendance and standard 10-day self-isolation were inconclusive for the rate of any PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.21; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). COVID-related absenteeism rates were 3704 absence days in 566,502 days-at-risk (6.5 per 1000 working days) in the control group and 2932 per 539,805 days-at-risk (5.4 per 1000 working days) in the intervention group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.25). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision. Uptake of the intervention was 71% in the intervention group, but not reported for the control intervention. The trial did not measure our other outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, adverse events, all-cause mortality, quality of life, or hospitalisation. We found seven ongoing studies using elimination-of-hazard strategies, six RCTs and one non-randomised trial. Administrative control interventions We found one ongoing RCT that aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection and reducing disease severity. Combinations of eligible interventions We included one non-randomised study examining a combination of elimination of hazards, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment. The study was conducted in two large retail companies in Italy in 2020. The study compared a safety operating protocol, measurement of body temperature and oxygen saturation upon entry, and a SARS-CoV-2 test strategy with a minimum activity protocol. Both groups received protective equipment. All employees working at the companies during the study period were included: 1987 in the intervention company and 1798 in the control company. The study did not report an outcome of interest for this systematic review. Other intervention categories We did not find any studies in this category. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether a test-based attendance policy affects rates of PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (any infection; symptomatic infection) compared to standard 10-day self-isolation amongst school and college staff. A test-based attendance policy may result in little to no difference in absenteeism rates compared to standard 10-day self-isolation. The non-randomised study included in our updated search did not report any outcome of interest for this Cochrane review. As a large part of the population is exposed in the case of a pandemic, an apparently small relative effect that would not be worthwhile from the individual perspective may still affect many people, and thus become an important absolute effect from the enterprise or societal perspective. The included RCT did not report on any of our other primary outcomes (i.e. SARS-CoV-2-related mortality and adverse events). We identified no completed studies on any other interventions specified in this review; however, eight eligible studies are ongoing. More controlled studies are needed on testing and isolation strategies, and working from home, as these have important implications for work organisations."

                "title": "Multiomics analysis reveals the involvement of NET1 in tumour immune regulation and malignant progression.",
                "abstract": "Neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1 (NET1) is a member of the Ras homologue family member A\u00a0(RhoA) subfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and a key protein involved in the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases, which act as regulators of cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and cell movement and are crucial for cancer spread. Research has shown that NET1 can regulate the malignant biological functions of tumour cells, such as growth, invasion, and metastasis, and it is closely related to the progression of pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer. However, the comprehensive role and mechanistic function of NET1 in other types of cancer remain largely unexplored. A deeper understanding of the role of NET1 may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression and metastasis.\u00a0This study aims to fill this knowledge gap and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of NET1 in cancer biology. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were utilized to analyse the differential expression of NET1 in normal and cancer tissues. The prognostic value of NET1 in cancer was evaluated through log-rank tests and Cox regression models. Further analysis was conducted to assess the relationships between NET1 expression and clinical features, as well as its diagnostic value. We investigated potential factors contributing to genetic alterations in NET1 to elucidate the role of NET1 in cancer progression. We also explored the relationships between NET1 and genes associated with epigenetic modifications, oncogenes, and tumour characteristics, such as RNA stemness scores (RNAss), DNA stemness scores (DNAss), the tumour mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Additionally, we analysed the associations between NET1 expression and immune cell infiltration, immunoregulatory genes, and sensitivity to therapeutic drugs. We conducted gene set enrichment analysis to further investigate the signalling pathways that might be affected by changes in NET1. The prognostic value of NET1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was further validated using real-world and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data. Finally, through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we confirmed that the overexpression of NET1 contributed to the malignant progression of TNBC cells, and we explored the potential mechanism by which NET1 regulates malignant biological behaviour through cellular experiments. Our study revealed a higher expression level of NET1 in 18 types of tumour tissues than in their corresponding normal tissues. Specifically, we observed high expression of NET1 in LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA tumour tissues, which was associated with a poor prognosis. In terms of gene alterations, \"amplification\", \"mutation\", and \"deep deletion\" were identified as the main types of changes occurring in NET1. Among these, \"amplification\" was predominantly observed in LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between copy number variations and the NET1 expression level in various tumours, including LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA. We also discovered that NET1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to epigenetic modification in almost all types of cancer and was related to the expression levels of numerous oncogenes. In certain tumours, a significant positive correlation was noted between the expression of NET1 and TMB, MSI, DNAss, and RNAss. Intriguingly, in most tumours, NET1 expression was strongly negatively correlated with the levels of infiltrating natural killer cells and M1 macrophages. Moreover, NET1 expression was significantly positively correlated with the expression of immune genes in nearly all types of cancer. An analysis of single-cell data revealed that NET1 was expressed primarily in malignant tumour cells in most tumours, with little to no expression in immune cells. Additionally, the expression level of NET1 was associated with sensitivity to various therapeutic drugs. Data from GEO and real-world studies indicated high expression of NET1 in TNBC tissues, which was correlated with a poor prognosis. Cellular experiments indicated that NET1 could regulate the proliferation, invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis of TNBC cells. Furthermore, NET1 may mediate the malignant proliferation of tumour cells through the AKT signalling pathway. NET1 can serve as a potential prognostic marker for LIHC, LUSC, PAAD, and BRCA tumours. Real-world data further suggest that NET1 can also serve as a prognostic indicator for TNBC. High expression of NET1 may contribute to the malignant proliferation of TNBC cells, potentially through the AKT signalling pathway. Moreover, NET1 may contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that can promote tumour progression. Therefore, targeting NET1 may represents a promising approach for inhibiting tumour progression."

                "title": "Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for multiple sclerosis: a network meta-analysis.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Different therapeutic strategies are available for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) including immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies. Their relative effectiveness in the prevention of relapse or disability progression is unclear due to the limited number of direct comparison trials. A summary of the results, including both direct and indirect comparisons of treatment effects, may help to clarify the above uncertainty. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative efficacy and acceptability of interferon \u00df-1b (IFN\u00df-1b) (Betaseron), interferon \u00df-1a (IFN\u00df-1a) (Rebif and Avonex), glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulins, and long-term corticosteroids versus placebo or another active agent in participants with MS and to provide a ranking of the treatments according to their effectiveness and risk-benefit balance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports. The most recent search was run in February 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that studied one of the 11 treatments for use in adults with MS and that reported our pre-speci\ufb01ed efficacy outcomes were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Identifying search results and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Data synthesis was performed by pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis that was performed within a Bayesian framework. The body of evidence for outcomes within the pairwise meta-analysis was assessed according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high quality. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four trials were included in this review, in which 17,401 participants had been randomised. Twenty-three trials included relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (9096 participants, 52%), 18 trials included progressive MS (7726, 44%), and three trials included both RRMS and progressive MS (579, 3%). The majority of the included trials were short-term studies, with the median duration being 24 months. The results originated mostly from 33 trials on IFN\u00df, glatiramer acetate, and natalizumab that overall contributed outcome data for 9881 participants (66%).From the pairwise meta-analysis, there was high quality evidence that natalizumab and IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) were effective against recurrence of relapses in RRMS during the first 24 months of treatment compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.43; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.71, respectively); they were more effective than IFN\u00df-1a (Avonex) (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.36; OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.60, respectively). IFN\u00df-1b (Betaseron) and mitoxantrone probably decreased the odds of the participants with RRMS having clinical relapses compared to placebo (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.54, respectively) but the quality of evidence for these treatments was graded as moderate. From the network meta-analysis, the most effective drug appeared to be natalizumab (median OR versus placebo 0.29, 95% credible intervals (CrI) 0.17 to 0.51), followed by IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) (median OR versus placebo 0.44, 95% CrI 0.24 to 0.70), mitoxantrone (median OR versus placebo 0.43, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.87), glatiramer acetate (median OR versus placebo 0.48, 95% CrI 0.38 to 0.75), IFN\u00df-1b (Betaseron) (median OR versus placebo 0.48, 95% CrI 0.29 to 0.78). However, our confidence was moderate for direct comparison of mitoxantrone and IFNB-1b vs placebo and very low for direct comparison of glatiramer vs placebo. The relapse outcome for RRMS at three years' follow-up was not reported by any of the included trials.Disability progression was based on surrogate markers in the majority of included studies and was unavailable for RRMS beyond two to three years. The pairwise meta-analysis suggested, with moderate quality evidence, that natalizumab and IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) probably decreased the odds of the participants with RRMS having disability progression at two years' follow-up, with an absolute reduction of 14% and 10%, respectively, compared to placebo. Natalizumab and IFN\u00df-1b (Betaseron) were significantly more effective (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70, respectively) than IFN\u00df-1a (Avonex) in reducing the number of the participants with RRMS who had progression at two years' follow-up, and confidence in this result was graded as moderate. From the network meta-analyses, mitoxantrone appeared to be the most effective agent in decreasing the odds of the participants with RRMS having progression at two years' follow-up, but our confidence was very low for direct comparison of mitoxantrone vs placebo. Both pairwise and network meta-analysis revealed that none of the individual agents included in this review were effective in preventing disability progression over two or three years in patients with progressive MS.There was not a dose-effect relationship for any of the included treatments with the exception of mitoxantrone. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review should provide some guidance to clinicians and patients. On the basis of high quality evidence, natalizumab and IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) are superior to all other treatments for preventing clinical relapses in RRMS in the short-term (24 months) compared to placebo. Moderate quality evidence supports a protective effect of natalizumab and IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) against disability progression in RRMS in the short-term compared to placebo. These treatments are associated with long-term serious adverse events and their benefit-risk balance might be unfavourable. IFN\u00df-1b (Betaseron) and mitoxantrone probably decreased the odds of the participants with RRMS having relapses, compared with placebo (moderate quality of evidence). The benefit-risk balance with azathioprine is uncertain, however this agent might be effective in decreasing the odds of the participants with RRMS having relapses and disability progression over 24 to 36 months, compared with placebo. The lack of convincing efficacy data shows that IFN\u00df-1a (Avonex), intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide and long-term steroids have an unfavourable benefit-risk balance in RRMS. None of the included treatments are effective in decreasing disability progression in patients with progressive MS. It is important to consider that the clinical effects of all these treatments beyond two years are uncertain, a relevant point for a disease of 30 to 40 years duration. Direct head-to-head comparison(s) between natalizumab and IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) or between azathioprine and IFN\u00df-1a (Rebif) should be top priority on the research agenda and follow-up of the trial cohorts should be mandatory."

                "title": "Unfractionated heparin versus low molecular weight heparins for avoiding heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in postoperative patients.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse drug reaction presenting as a prothrombotic disorder related to antibody-mediated platelet activation. It is a paradoxical immune reaction resulting in thrombin generation in vivo, which leads to a hypercoagulable state and the potential to initiate venous or arterial thrombosis. A number of factors are thought to influence the incidence of HIT including the type and preparation of heparin (unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)) and the heparin-exposed patient population, with the postoperative patient population at higher risk.Although LMWH has largely replaced UFH as a front-line therapy, there is evidence supporting a lack of superiority of LMWH compared with UFH regarding prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following surgery, and similar frequencies of bleeding have been described with LMWH and UFH. The decision as to which of these two preparations of heparin to use may thus be influenced by harmful effects such as HIT. We therefore sought to determine the relative impact of UFH and LMWH on HIT in postoperative patients receiving thromboembolism prophylaxis. This is an update of a review first published in 2012. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to compare the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and HIT complicated by venous thromboembolism in postoperative patients exposed to unfractionated heparin (UFH) versus low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). SEARCH METHODS: For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (May 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4) and trials registries. The authors searched Lilacs (June 2016) and additional trials were sought from reference lists of relevant publications. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were postoperative patients allocated to receive prophylaxis with UFH or LMWH, in a blinded or unblinded fashion. Studies were excluded if they did not use the accepted definition of HIT. This was defined as a relative reduction in the platelet count of 50% or greater from the postoperative peak (even if the platelet count at its lowest remained greater than 150 x 109/L) occurring within five to 14 days after the surgery, with or without a thrombotic event occurring in this timeframe. Additionally, we required circulating antibodies associated with the syndrome to have been investigated through laboratory assays. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with participation of a third author. MAIN RESULTS: In this update, we included three trials involving 1398 postoperative participants. Participants were submitted to general surgical procedures, minor and major, and the minimum mean age was 49 years. Pooled analysis showed a significant reduction in the risk of HIT with LMWH compared with UFH (risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.73); low-quality evidence. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 59. The risk of HIT was consistently reduced comparing participants undergoing major surgical procedures exposed to LMWH or UFH (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.75); low-quality evidence. The occurrence of HIT complicated by venous thromboembolism was significantly lower in participants receiving LMWH compared with UFH (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.84); low-quality evidence. The NNTB was 75. Arterial thrombosis occurred in only one participant who received UFH. There were no amputations or deaths documented. Although limited evidence is available, it appears that HIT induced by both types of heparins is common in people undergoing major surgical procedures (incidence greater than 1% and less than 10%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This updated review demonstrated low-quality evidence of a lower incidence of HIT, and HIT complicated by venous thromboembolism, in postoperative patients undergoing thromboprophylaxis with LMWH compared with UFH. Similarily, the risk of HIT in people undergoing major surgical procedures was lower when treated with LMWH compared to UFH (low-quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to concerns about the risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the study results. These findings may support current clinical use of LMWH over UFH as front-line heparin therapy. However, our conclusions are limited and there was an unexpected paucity of RCTs including HIT as an outcome. To address the scarcity of clinically-relevant information on HIT, HIT must be included as a core harmful outcome in future RCTs of heparin."

                "title": "MIC distribution analysis identifies differences in AMR between population sub-groups.",
                "abstract": "Background: Phenotypic data, such as the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical samples, are widely available through routine surveillance. MIC distributions inform antibiotic dosing in clinical care by determining cutoffs to define isolates as susceptible or resistant. However, differences in MIC distributions between patient sub-populations could indicate strain variation and hence differences in transmission, infection, or selection. Methods: The Vivli AMR register contains a wealth of MIC and metadata for a vast range of bacteria-antibiotic combinations. Using a generalisable methodology followed by multivariate regression, we explored MIC distribution variations across 4 bacteria, covering 7,135,070 samples, by key population sub-groups such as age, sex and infection type, and over time. Results: We found clear differences between MIC distributions across various patient sub-groups for a subset of bacteria-antibiotic pairings. For example, within Staphylococcus aureus, MIC distributions by age group and infection site displayed clear trends, especially for levofloxacin with higher resistance levels in older age groups (odds of 2.17 in those aged 85+ compared to 19-64), which appeared more often in men. This trend could reflect greater use of fluoroquinolones in adults than children but also reveals an increasing MIC level with age, suggesting either transmission differences or accumulation of resistance effects. We also observed high variations by WHO region, and over time, with the latter likely linked to changes in surveillance. Conclusions: We found that MIC distributions can be used to identify differences in AMR levels between population sub-groups. Our methodology could be used more widely to unveil hidden transmission sources and effects of antibiotic use in different patient sub-groups, highlighting opportunities to improve stewardship programmes and interventions, particularly at local scales."

                "title": "Ceftazidime with avibactam for treating severe aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections: technology evaluation to inform a novel subscription-style payment model.",
                "abstract": "Background: To limit the use of antimicrobials without disincentivising the development of novel antimicrobials, there is interest in establishing innovative models that fund antimicrobials based on an evaluation of their value as opposed to the volumes used. The aim of this project was to evaluate the population-level health benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam in the NHS in England, for the treatment of severe aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections when used within its licensed indications. The results were used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance in support of commercial discussions regarding contract value between the manufacturer and NHS England. Methods: The health benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam was first derived for a series of high-value clinical scenarios. These represented uses that were expected to have a significant impact on patients' mortality risks and health-related quality of life. Patient-level costs and health-related quality of life of ceftazidime-avibactam under various usage scenarios compared with alternative management strategies in the high-value clinical scenarios were quantified using decision modelling. Results were reported as incremental net health effects expressed in quality-adjusted life-years, which were scaled to 20-year population in quality-adjusted life-years using infection number forecasts based on data from Public Health England. The outcomes estimated for the high-value clinical scenarios were extrapolated to other expected uses for ceftazidime-avibactam. Results: The clinical effectiveness of ceftazidime-avibactam relative to its comparators was estimated by synthesising evidence on susceptibility of the pathogens of interest to the antimicrobials in a network meta-analysis. In the base case, ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with a statistically significantly higher susceptibility relative to colistin (odds ratio 7.24, 95% credible interval 2.58 to 20.94). The remainder of the treatments were associated with lower susceptibility than colistin (odds ratio < 1). The results were sensitive to the definition of resistance and the studies included in the analysis. In the base case, patient-level benefit of ceftazidime-avibactam was between 0.08 and 0.16 quality-adjusted life-years, depending on the site of infection and the usage scenario. There was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the benefits of ceftazidime-avibactam across all subgroups, and the results were sensitive to assumptions in the meta-analysis used to estimate susceptibility. There was substantial uncertainty in the number of infections that are suitable for treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam, so population-level results are presented for a range of scenarios for the current infection numbers, the expected increases in infections over time, and rates of emergence of resistance. The population-level benefit varied substantially across the scenarios, from 531 to 2342 quality-adjusted life-years over 20 years. Conclusion: This work has provided quantitative estimates of the value of ceftazidime-avibactam within its areas of expected usage within the NHS. Limitations: Given existing evidence, the estimates of the value of ceftazidime-avibactam are highly uncertain. Future work: Future evaluations of antimicrobials would benefit from improvements to NHS data linkages, research to support appropriate synthesis of susceptibility studies, and application of routine data and decision modelling to assess enablement value.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This is an update of the original review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011, Issue 11, and updated in 2015, Issue 4.Chemotherapy has significantly improved prognosis for women with malignant and some non-malignant conditions. This treatment, however, is associated with ovarian toxicity. The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, both agonists and antagonists, may have a protective effect on the ovaries. The primary mechanism of action of GnRH analogues is to suppress the gonadotropin levels to simulate pre-pubertal hormonal milieu and subsequently prevent primordial follicles from maturation and therefore decrease the number of follicles that are more vulnerable to chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of GnRH analogues given before or in parallel to chemotherapy to prevent chemotherapy-related ovarian damage in premenopausal women with malignant or non-malignant conditions. SEARCH METHODS: The search was run for the original review in July 2011, and for the first update in July 2014. For this update we searched the following databases in November 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in all languages, which examined the effect of GnRH analogues for chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure in premenopausal women, were eligible for inclusion in the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed binary data using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and for continuous data, we used the standardized mean difference (SMD) to combine trials. We applied the random-effects model in our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table for our main outcomes of interest. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs involving 1369 women between the ages of 12 and 51.1 years. Participants were diagnosed with breast malignancy, ovarian malignancy, or Hodgkin's lymphoma, and most of them received alkylating, or platinum complexes, based chemotherapy. The included studies were funded by a university (n = 1), research centres (n = 4), and pharmaceutical companies (n = 1). Trials were at high or unclear risk of bias.Comparison 1: GnRH agonist plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy aloneThe incidence of menstruation recovery or maintenance was 178 of 239 (74.5%) in the GnRH agonist group and 110 of 221 (50.0%) in the control group during a follow-up period no longer than 12 months (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.24; 5 studies, 460 participants; I2 = 79%; low-certainty evidence), with an overall effect favouring treatment with GnRH agonist (P = 0.006). However, we observed no difference during a follow-up period longer than 12 months between these two groups (P = 0.24). In the GnRH agonist group, 326 of 447 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (72.9%) in comparison to the control group, in which 276 of 422 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (65.4%) during a follow-up period longer than 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.22; 8 studies, 869 participants; I2 = 56%; low-certainty evidence).The incidence of premature ovarian failure was 43 of 401 (10.7%) in the GnRH agonist group and 96 of 379 (25.3%) in the control group (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.61; 4 studies, 780 participants; I2 = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence), with an overall effect favouring treatment with GnRH agonist (P < 0.00001).The incidence of pregnancy was 32 of 356 (9.0%) in the GnRH agonist group and 22 of 347 (6.3%) in the control group (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.70; 7 studies, 703 participants; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 0.09). However, we are cautious about this conclusion because there were insufficient data about whether the participants intended to become pregnant.The incidence of ovulation was 29 of 47 (61.7%) in the GnRH agonist group and 12 of 48 (25.0%) in the control group (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.26; 2 studies, 95 participants; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GnRH (P = 0.001).The most common adverse effects of GnRH analogues included hot flushes, vaginal dryness, urogenital symptoms, and mood swings. The pooled analysis of safety data showed no difference in adverse effects between GnRH agonist group and control group.Comparison 2: GnRH agonist-antagonist cotreatment plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy aloneOnly one RCT discussed GnRH agonist-antagonist cotreatment. The limited evidence showed the incidence of menstruation recovery or maintenance was 20 of 25 (80%) in both cotreatment group and control group during a 12-month follow-up period (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 1.00). In the cotreatment group, 13 of 25 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (52.0%) in comparison to the control group, in which 14 of 25 participants had menstruation recovery or maintenance (56.0%) during a follow-up period longer than 12 months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.55; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 0.78). The incidence of pregnancy was 1 of 25 (4.0%) in the cotreatment group and 0 of 25 (0%) in the control group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.30; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with no difference between groups (P = 0.49). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: GnRH agonist appears to be effective in protecting the ovaries during chemotherapy, in terms of maintenance and resumption of menstruation, treatment-related premature ovarian failure and ovulation. Evidence for protection of fertility was insufficient and needs further investigation. Evidence was also insufficient to assess the effect of GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist cotreatment on ovarian protection against chemotherapy. The included studies differed in some important aspects of design, and most of these studies had no age-determined subgroup analysis. Large and well-designed RCTs with longer follow-up duration should be conducted to clarify the effects of GnRH analogues in preventing chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, especially on different age groups or different chemotherapy regimens. Furthermore, studies should address the effects on pregnancy rates and anti-tumour therapy."

            "abstract": "Activating autoantibodies to the \u03b21-adrenergic and M2 muscarinic receptors are present in a very high percentage of patients with Graves' disease and atrial fibrillation (AF). The objective of this study was to develop a reproducible animal model and thereby to examine the impact of these endocrine-like autoantibodies alone and with thyroid hormone on induction of thyroid-associated atrial tachyarrhythmias. Five New Zealand white rabbits were coimmunized with peptides from the second extracellular loops of the \u03b21-adrenergic and M2 muscarinic receptors to produce both sympathomimetic and parasympathomimetic antibodies. A catheter-based electrophysiological study was performed on anesthetized rabbits before and after immunization and subsequent treatment with thyroid hormone. Antibody expression facilitated the induction of sustained sinus, junctional and atrial tachycardias, but not AF. Addition of excessive thyroid hormone resulted in induced sustained AF in all animals. AF induction was blocked acutely by the neutralization of these antibodies with immunogenic peptides despite continued hyperthyroidism. The measured atrial effective refractory period as one parameter of AF propensity shortened significantly after immunization and was acutely reversed by peptide neutralization. No further decrease in the effective refractory period was observed after the addition of thyroid hormone, suggesting other cardiac effects of thyroid hormone may contribute to its role in AF induction. This study demonstrates autonomic autoantibodies and thyroid hormone potentiate the vulnerability of the heart to AF, which can be reversed by decoy peptide therapy. These data help fulfill Witebsky's postulates for an increased autoimmune/endocrine basis for Graves' hyperthyroidism and AF. "

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We studied activating autoantibodies to beta-1 adrenergic receptors (AAbeta1AR) and activating autoantibodies to M2 muscarinic receptors (AAM2R) in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) in Graves' hyperthyroidism. BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation frequently complicates hyperthyroidism. Both AAbeta1AR and AAM2R have been described in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and AF. We hypothesized that their copresence would facilitate AF in autoimmune Graves' hyperthyroidism. METHODS: Immunoglobulin G purified from 38 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism with AF (n=17) or sinus rhythm (n=21) and 10 healthy control subjects was tested for its effects on isolated canine Purkinje fiber contractility with and without atropine and nadolol. Immunoglobulin G electrophysiologic effects were studied using intracellular recordings from isolated canine pulmonary veins. Potential cross-reactivity of AAbeta1AR and AAM2R with stimulating thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) antibodies was evaluated before and after adsorption to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human TSHRs using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The frequency of AAbeta1AR and/or AAM2R differed significantly between patients with AF and sinus rhythm (AAbeta1AR=94% vs. 38%, p<0.001; AAM2R=88% vs. 19%, p<0.001; and AAbeta1AR+AAM2R=82% vs. 10%, p<0.001). The copresence of AAbeta1AR and AAM2R was the strongest predictor of AF (odds ratio: 33.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 964.11, p=0.04). Immunoglobulin G from autoantibody-positive patients induced hyperpolarization, decreased action potential duration, enhanced early afterdepolarization formation, and facilitated triggered firing in pulmonary veins by local autonomic nerve stimulation. Immunoadsorption studies showed that AAbeta1AR and AAM2R were immunologically distinct from TSHR antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: When present in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, AAbeta1AR and AAM2R facilitate development of AF."

Immunization of rabbits with a \u03b21AR or \u03b22AR second extracellular loop peptide produced high titers of \u03b21AR-AAb or \u03b22AR-AAb. Thyroid hormone in combination with \u03b21AR-AAb or \u03b22AR-AAb induced a significant number of sustained sinus tachycardia and atrial tachycardia, respectively. Both combinations resulted in significantly increased inductions of sustained arrhythmias compared to AAb alone. Thyroid hormone alone induced sustained sinus and junctional tachycardia. Sera from immunized rabbits specifically bound to and activated \u03b21AR or \u03b22AR in transfected cells in vitro. This study demonstrates thyroid hormone qualitatively accentuates the specific arrhythmogenic action of these AAb and quantitatively enhances their rate.

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Previous studies demonstrated that burst pacing and subthreshold infusion of acetylcholine in \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR)-immunized rabbits induced sustained sinus tachycardia. The aim of this study was to examine the anti-arrhythmogenic effect of a newly designed retro-inverso (RI) peptidomimetic inhibitor that specifically targets the \u03b21AR antibodies in the rabbit. METHODS: Six New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with a \u03b21AR second extracellular loop peptide to produce sympathomimetic \u03b21AR antibodies. A catheter-based electrophysiological study was performed on anesthetized rabbits before and after immunization and subsequent treatment with the RI peptide inhibitor. Each rabbit served as its own control. RESULTS: No sustained arrhythmias were induced at preimmune baseline. At 6\u00a0weeks after immunization, there was a marked increase in induced sustained tachyarrhythmias, predominantly sinus tachycardia, which was largely suppressed by the RI peptide. The atrial effective refractory period was shortened significantly in immunized rabbits compared to their preimmune state. The RI peptide reversed and prolonged this shortening. \u03b21AR antibody levels were negatively correlated with the atrial effective refractory period. Postimmune sera-induced \u03b21AR activation in transfected cells in vitro was also blocked by the RI peptide. CONCLUSIONS: \u03b21AR-activating autoantibodies are associated with reduction of the atrial effective refractory period and facilitate arrhythmia induction in this model. The RI peptide reversal may have important therapeutic implications in subjects who harbor these autoantibodies."

                "abstract": "NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Do autoantibodies to the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R-AAbs) have the potential to facilitate specific sustained tachyarrhythmias in the presence of thyroxine\u00a0(T4 ) in rabbits? What is the main finding and its importance? The M2R-AAb and T4 jointly destabilized the electrophysiological properties, thus promoting the occurrence of atrial and sinus tachyarrhythmias in rabbits. These findings provide a practical basis for understanding the pathophysiological role of M2R-AAb alone and with T4 in arrhythmia induction and might provide an innovative option for treatment of Graves' disease with rhythm disturbance. ABSTRACT: Activating autoantibodies toward the \u03b21/2 -adrenergic receptors (\u03b21/2AR-AAbs) and M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R-AAbs) are present in a high proportion of patients with Graves' disease. We previously demonstrated that \u03b21/2AR-AAbs with or without the presence of M2R-AAbs in combination with excessive thyroxine\u00a0(T4 ) increased the induction of sustained tachyarrhythmias in an autoimmune rabbit model. However, the separate role of M2R-AAbs and their interaction with T4 are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of M2R-AAbs and T4 on the induction of cardiac arrhythmias in a similar rabbit model. Ten New Zealand White rabbits were randomly divided into two groups. In group\u00a0A (n\u00a0=\u00a06), the rabbits were immunized with the second extracellular loop peptide of M2R and subjected to 2\u00a0weeks of T4 treatment. In group\u00a0B (n\u00a0=\u00a04), the rabbits were treated only with T4 for 2\u00a0weeks. After induction of general anaesthesia, rabbits were subjected to an electrophysiological study at 0 (pre-immune), 6 (post-immune) and 8\u00a0weeks (post-immune+T4 treatment) in group\u00a0A and at 0 (baseline) and 8\u00a0weeks (T4 treatment) in group\u00a0B. Each rabbit served as its own control. In group\u00a0A, high levels and activity of M2R-AAbs were detected in all immunized animals. Thyroxine in combination with immunization significantly increased induction of sustained sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation in comparison to the pre-immune state. In group\u00a0B, T4 predominantly induced sustained sinus tachycardia. This study demonstrated that M2R-AAbs and T4 jointly increased the susceptibility to both sinus and atrial tachyarrhythmias. The data supported the pathophysiological role of M2R-AAbs in hyperthyroidism-associated supraventricular tachyarrhythmias."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown that autoantibodies against M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors may play a role in the development of atrial fibrillation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of anti-M2 receptor autoantibodies on rabbit atria in vivo. METHODS: Rabbits were immunized monthly with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the M2 receptor. The atrial electrophysiology of the isolated perfused rabbit hearts was studied. Western blots and RT-PCR were performed to determine the expression of the atrial muscarinic receptor and the acetylcholine-activated potassium channel. Atrial tissue was stained with Masson's trichrome stain for fibrosis detection. RESULTS: Autoantibodies were persistently detected in immunized rabbits. M2 rabbits showed a significantly shorter atrial effective refractory period and a longer intra-atrial activation time than control rabbits. Electrical stimuli induced a significantly larger number of repetitive atrial responses in M2 rabbits. The protein levels of the M2 receptor and GIRK4 were upregulated in M2 rabbits. The mRNA levels of GIRK1 and GIRK4 were also upregulated. Histological examination revealed significantly increased diffuse fibrotic deposition in M2 rabbit atria compared with control rabbits. CONCLUSION: The M2 receptor autoantibody-positive rabbits showed altered atrial electrophysiology, overexpression of the M2 receptor-I(K,ACh) pathway and atrial fibrosis, which indicates that the autoantibodies against M2 receptors may participate in the induction and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation."

                "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea, which involves chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), is a major risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether or not CIH alone alters cardiac mechanisms to support AF is unknown. This study investigated the effects of CIH on atrial electrophysiology and arrhythmia vulnerability and evaluated the role of autonomics in CIH promotion of AF. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 8 h/day of CIH or normoxia for 7 days. After exposure, rats were anesthetized for intracardiac electrophysiological experiments. Atrial effective refractory periods (AERPs) and AF inducibility were determined using programmed electrical stimulation and burst pacing in the absence and presence of autonomic receptor agonists and antagonists. Western blot analysis measured atrial protein expression of muscarinic M2, M3, and \u03b21-adrenergic receptors. Compared with normoxia-exposed control rats, CIH-exposed rats had enhanced AF vulnerability using both programmed electrical stimulation and burst pacing, accompanied by greater AERP responses to carbachol and propranolol, lesser responses to isoproterenol, and higher atrial M2 receptor protein levels. Enhanced atrial vulnerability was accentuated by carbachol and abolished by atropine, indicating that the AF-promoting effects of CIH depended principally on parasympathetic activation. Enhancement of atrial vulnerability and AERP shortening with cholinergic agonists in CIH-exposed rats is consistent with sensitivity to parasympathetic activation. Higher responses to adrenergic receptor blockade in CIH-exposed rats is consistent with sympathetic potentiation. These findings implicate CIH as an important mediator of enhanced AF susceptibility in obstructive sleep apnea and provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that chronic intermittent hypoxia alone enhances vulnerability to atrial arrhythmia induction, which depends principally on parasympathetic activation. Enhanced atrial vulnerability was accompanied by heightened electrophysiological responses of the atrial myocardium to carbachol and isoproterenol, dampened responses to propranolol, and increased atrial M2 receptor protein levels."

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that activating autoantibodies to the \u03b22AR in the rabbit atrium are arrhythmogenic. METHODS: Five New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with a \u03b22AR second extracellular loop peptide to raise \u03b22AR antibody titers. A catheter-based electrophysiologic study was performed on anesthetized rabbits before and after immunization. Arrhythmia occurrence was determined in response to burst pacing before and after the infusion of acetylcholine in incremental concentrations of 10 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, and 1 mM at 1 mL/min. RESULTS: In the preimmune studies when \u03b22AR antibody titers were undetectable, of a total of 20 events, only 3 episodes of nonsustained (<10 seconds) atrial arrhythmias were induced. In the postimmune studies when \u03b22AR antibody titers ranged from 1:160,000 to 1:1.28 million, burst pacing induced 10 episodes of nonsustained or sustained (\u226510 seconds) arrhythmias in 20 events (P = .04 vs preimmune; \u03c7(2) and Fisher exact test). Taking into account only the sustained arrhythmias, there were 6 episodes in 20 events in the postimmune studies compared with 0 episodes in 20 events in the preimmune studies (P = .02). Immunized rabbits demonstrated immunoglobulin G deposition in the atria, and their sera induced significant activation of \u03b22AR in transfected cells in vitro compared to the preimmune sera. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced autoantibody activation of \u03b22AR in the rabbit atrium leads to atrial arrhythmias mainly in the form of sustained atrial tachycardia."

However, the pathophysiological role of these autoantibodies in the development of cardiomyopathy is unknown. We previously reported an experimental model of early-stage DCM-like cardiomyopathy induced by immunizing rabbits for 1 year with synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence of the second extracellular loop of either beta1-adrenoceptor or M2-muscarinic receptor. Because approximately half the sera of patients with DCM that recognize one of the two receptor sequences also recognize the second sequence, a model was created in rabbits simultaneously immunized with the synthetic peptides corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the beta1-adrenoceptor and M2-muscarinic receptor. METHODS AND RESULTS: All rabbits (n = 8) immunized with both peptides had a high titer of both anti-beta1-adrenoceptor and anti-M2-muscarinic receptor autoantibodies in their sera, whereas none of the sera from control rabbits injected with saline (n = 9) was positive. No significant cross-reaction with peptides other than those used for immunization was found. The weight of the hearts of immunized rabbits increased significantly. The hearts of immunized rabbits showed marked concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild inflammatory cell infiltration. In these rabbits, mild or moderate interstitial fibrosis was also observed. In electron micrographs, immunized rabbits showed focal myofibrillar lysis, loss of myofilament, and a marked increase in the number of mitochondria and deposition of dense granules in both sarcoplasm and myofibrils. Conversely, one of the control rabbits showed scant mononuclear cell infiltration. However, in this control rabbit, no significant alteration was found by electron microscopy. CONCLUSION: Our results showed the coexistence of both anti-beta1-adrenoceptor and anti-M2-muscarinic receptor autoantibodies in the sera has pathophysiological importance, shown by their ability to induce cardiac hypertrophy in rabbits."

The objective of this study was to examine the arrhythmogenic effect of \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR)-activating autoantibodies in the rabbit. Eight New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with a \u03b21AR second extracellular loop peptide to raise \u03b21AR antibody titers.

Arrhythmia occurrence was determined in response to burst pacing before and after ACh infusion in incremental concentrations of 10 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, and 1 mM. The baseline sinus heart rate before and after immunization averaged 149 \u00b1 17 per min and 169 \u00b1 16 per min, respectively (P < 0.05). In the preimmune studies, there were five sustained (\u226510 s) arrhythmias in 32 induction attempts, which occurred in only four of eight rabbits. In the postimmune studies, there were 22 sustained arrhythmias in 32 induction attempts, which occurred in all eight rabbits (P < 0.0001 for the independent effect of immunization). Of the 22 sustained arrhythmias postimmunization, 15 were sinus tachycardia compared with only two before immunization (P < 0.01 for the independent effect of immunization). Postimmune (but not preimmune) rabbit sera demonstrated specific binding to \u03b21AR and induced significant \u03b21AR activation in transfected cells in vitro. No cross-reactivity with \u03b22AR was observed. In conclusion, in contrast with rabbits with \u03b22AR-activating autoantibodies that demonstrate predominantly atrial tachycardias, enhanced autoantibody activation of \u03b21AR in the rabbit leads to tachyarrhythmias mainly in the form of sustained sinus tachycardia.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmias among old people. It causes serious long-term health problems affecting the quality of life. It has been suggested that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the onset and maintenance of AF in human. However, investigation of its pathogenesis and potential treatment has been hampered by the lack of suitable AF models in experimental animals. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to establish a long-lasting AF model in mice. We also investigated the role of adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes, which may be involved in the onset and duration of AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Trans-esophageal atrial burst pacing in mice could induce AF, as previously shown, but with only a short duration (29.0 \u00b1 8.1 sec). We found that adrenergic activation by intraperitoneal norepinephrine (NE) injection strikingly increased the AF duration. It increased the duration to more than 10 minutes, i.e., by more than 20-fold (656.2 \u00b1 104.8 sec; P<0.001). In this model, a prior injection of a specific \u03b21-AR blocker metoprolol and an \u03b11-AR blocker prazosin both significantly attenuated NE-induced elongation of AF. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these receptors' effects on AF, we assessed the SR Ca(2+) leak, a major trigger of AF, and consequent spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release (SCR) in atrial myocytes. Consistent with the results of our in-vivo experiments, both metoprolol and prazosin significantly inhibited the NE-induced SR Ca(2+) leak and SCR. These findings suggest that both \u03b21-AR and \u03b11-AR may play important roles in the development of AF. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a long-lasting AF model in mice induced by adrenergic activation, which will be valuable in future AF study using experimental animals, such as transgenic mice. We also revealed the important role of \u03b21- and \u03b11-AR-mediated signaling in the development of AF through in-vivo and in-vitro experiments."

                "abstract": "Background Previous studies have demonstrated that functional autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors may be involved in the pathogenesis of postural tachycardia syndrome. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of these autoantibodies on cardiovascular responses to postural changes and adrenergic orthosteric ligand infusions in immunized rabbits. Methods and Results Eight New Zealand white rabbits were coimmunized with peptides from the \u03b11-adrenergic receptor and \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR). Tilt test and separate adrenergic agonist infusion studies were performed on conscious animals before and after immunization and subsequent treatment with epitope-mimetic peptide inhibitors. At 6\u00a0weeks after immunization, there was a greater percent increase in heart rate upon tilting compared with preimmune baseline. No significant difference in blood pressure response to tilting was observed. The heart rate response to infusion of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol was significantly enhanced in immunized animals, suggesting a positive allosteric effect of \u03b21AR antibodies. In contrast, the blood pressure response to infusion of the \u03b11-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine was attenuated in immunized animals, indicating a negative allosteric effect of \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antibodies. Injections of antibody-neutralizing peptides suppressed the postural tachycardia and reversed the altered heart rate and blood pressure responses to orthosteric ligand infusions in immunized animals at 6 and 30\u00a0weeks. Antibody production and suppression were confirmed with in\u00a0vitro bioassays. Conclusions The differential allosteric effect of \u03b11-adrenergic receptor and \u03b21AR autoantibodies would lead to a hyperadrenergic state and overstimulation of cardiac \u03b21AR. These data support evidence for an autoimmune basis for postural tachycardia syndrome."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is independently associated with increased risk of stroke and death. Although the exact mechanisms of AF are not completely elucidated, a large number of evidences demonstrate that autoimmunity may play an important role in the initiation, the progression, and the maintenance of AF. In this study, we aimed to compare anti-\u03b21-adrenergic receptor autoantibody (anti-\u03b21-R) and anti-M2-muscarinic receptor autoantibody (anti-M2-R) levels between nonvalvular AF patients and healthy control subjects. METHODS: The levels of serum anti-\u03b21-R, antinuclear antibodies, and anti-M2-R were measured in both groups by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 concentration were measured, respectively, by immunoturbidimetry and chemiluminescence. RESULTS: Anti-\u03b21-R and anti-M2-R levels were significantly higher in patients with nonvalvular AF than in healthy controls (anti-\u03b21-R 221.11 [132.38-291.69] ng/mL vs 198.14 [125.70-278.40] ng/mL, P < 0.01; anti-M2-R 271.81 [144.99-378.20] ng/mL vs 235.01 [121.53-358.99] ng/mL, P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the serum levels of IL-6 and hs-CRP were higher in the nonvalvular AF group (IL-6 19.65 \u00b1 5.6\u00a0pg/mL vs 6.79 \u00b1 1.09 pg/mL, hs-CRP 6.03 \u00b1 1.35 mg/L vs 2.73 \u00b1 0.63 mg/L, P < 0.05). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) levels were similar between two groups (ANA 10.55 [1.86-271.8] U/mL vs 10.49 [1.303-161.7]\u00a0U/mL, P > 0.05). The baseline value of serum anti-\u03b21-R (odds ratio [OR]: 13.176, P < 0.001), anti-M2-R (OR: 4.41, P < 0.001), IL-6 (OR: 6.126, P < 0.05) levels, and left atrial diameter (OR: 5.781, P < 0.05) were independent predictors of nonvalvular AF by multivariable analyses. CONCLUSION: We found a significant association between circulating serum anti-\u03b21-R, anti-M2-R, IL-6 levels, and nonvalvular AF. We presume that the autoimmunity and inflammation might take part in electrical remodeling and structural remodeling of left atrium."

                "abstract": "Aging plays an important role in increased vulnerability to atrial fibrillation (AF). Mediated by activity at the muscarinic type 2 receptor (M2R), the parasympathetic nerve contributes to the onset of AF. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether aging changes the distribution of M2R in the atrial myocardium and to determine the impact of these changes on AF vulnerability. Expression of M2R in the atrial myocardium was evaluated by immunostaining and Western blot in three groups-young (3 months old), mature (8 months old) and senescent (36-48 months old) rabbits. AF inducibility was recorded with and without cervical vagal stimulation (VS) in vivo in all groups. AF inducibility, the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and the monophasic action potential (MAP) were recorded in an additional seven senescent rabbits before and after topical administration of tropicamide. The results showed that the density of M2R in the left atrial free wall (LAFW) was significantly higher than that in other parts of the atria. The left atrial appendage had a higher level of M2R expression than the right atrium. The M2R density of the epicardial side was greater than that of endocardial side in both atria. The senescent group had a significant increase in M2R expression in the LAFW relative to the mature group. AF inducibility was also higher in the senescent group than in the other two groups. After tropicamide administration in the senescent rabbits, AF inducibility decreased significantly, the VS-induced decrease in AERP and MAP duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) of LAFW was attenuated, and the dispersion of the AERP and MAPD90 increase was attenuated. In conclusion, our results suggested that there is spatial heterogeneity in the M2R distribution in the atria of the rabbit. The density of M2R in the LAFW increased with the aging of rabbits. This change in M2R enhanced the heterogeneity of the M2R distribution and contributed to the change in age-related AF vulnerability."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vagal activity is thought to influence atrial electrophysiological properties and play a role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). In this study, we assessed the effects of acute vagal stimulation (vagus_stim) on atrial conduction times, atrial and pulmonary vein (PV) refractoriness, and vulnerability to induction of AF in the rabbit heart with intact autonomic innervation. METHODS: An open-chest epicardial approach was performed in 11 rabbits (New Zealand; 3.9-5.0 kg), anesthetized and artificially ventilated after neuromuscular blockade. A 3-lead ECG was obtained. Atrial electrograms were recorded along the atria, from right to left (four monopolar electrodes), together with a circular electrode adapted for proximal left PV assessment. Acute vagus nerve stimulation was obtained with bipolar electrodes (20 Hz). Epicardial activation was recorded in sinus rhythm, and the conduction time from right (RA) to left atrium (LA), and from RA to PVs, was measured in basal conditions and during vagus_stim. The atrial effective refractory period (ERP) and dispersion of refractoriness (Disp_A) were analyzed. Vulnerability to AF induction was assessed at the right (RAA) and left (LAA) atrial appendages and the PVs. Atrial stimulation (50 Hz) was performed alone or combined with vagus_stim. Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored. RESULTS: In basal conditions, there was a significant delay in conduction from RA to PVs, not influenced by vagus_stim, and the PV ERPs were shorter than those measured in LA and LAA, but without significant differences compared to RA and RAA. During vagus_stim, conduction times between RA and LA increased from 16+8 ms to 27+6 ms (p < 0.05) and ERPs shortened significantly in RA, LAA and LA (p < 0.05), but not in RAA. There were no significant differences in Disp_A. AF induction was reproducible in 45% of cases at 50 Hz and in 100% at 50 Hz+vagus_stim (p < 0.05). The duration of inducible AF increased from 1.0 +/- 0.2 s to 12.0 +/- 4.5 s with 50 Hz+vagus_stim (p < 0.01). AF lasted >10 s in 45.4% of rabbits during vagus_stim, and ceased after vagus_stim in 4 out of these 5 cases. In 3 animals, PV tachycardia, with fibrillatory conduction, induced with 50 Hz PV pacing during vagus_stim. CONCLUSIONS: Vagus_stim reduces interatrial conduction velocity and significantly shortens atrial ERP, contributing to the induction and duration of AF episodes in the in vivo rabbit heart. This model may be useful for the assessment of autonomic influence on the pathophysiology of AF,"

DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty premenopausal women with Graves' disease were analyzed for IgG autoantibodies against \u03b21-adrenergic, muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 and angiotensin II type 1 receptors using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays based on cell membranes overexpressing receptors in their native conformations. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and heart symptoms were analyzed in hyperthyroidism and after 7.5 months of antithyroid treatment. Matched thyroid healthy controls were also assessed. RESULTS: Serum levels of antibodies against the \u03b21-adrenergic and the muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptors were higher in hyperthyroid patients than in controls (median \u03b21-adrenergic receptor antibodies 1.9 [IQR 1.3-2.7] vs. 1.1 [0.8-1.7] \u03bcg/mL, P<0.0001; muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor 20.5 [14.0-38.3] vs. 6.0 [3.2-9.9] U/mL, P<0.0001). These antibodies decreased in euthyroidism (P<0.01), but were still higher than in controls (P<0.01). Angiotensin II type 1 receptor levels did not differ. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was higher in hyperthyroidism (240 [134-372] vs. <35 [<35-67] ng/L, P<0.0001), normalized after treatment and did not correlate with autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies against the \u03b21-adrenergic and the muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptors were increased in Graves' patients, decreased with treatment, but did not correlate with cardiac function. However, an autoimmune effect on the heart cannot be excluded in subpopulations, as the functional properties of the analyzed antibodies remain to be determined."

We evaluated the effects of acute vagal stimulation on atrial conduction, refractoriness of atrial and pulmonary veins (PVs) and inducibility of AF. An open-chest epicardial approach was performed in New Zealand White rabbits with preserved autonomic innervation. Atrial electrograms were obtained with four unipolar electrodes placed epicardially along the atria (n = 22) and an electrode adapted to the proximal left PV (n = 10). The cervical vagus nerve was stimulated with bipolar platinum electrodes (20 Hz). Epicardial activation was recorded in sinus rhythm, and effective refractory periods (ERPs), dispersion of refractoriness and conduction times from high-lateral right atrium (RA) to high-lateral left atrium (LA) and PVs assessed at baseline and during vagal stimulation. Burst pacing (50 Hz, 10 s), alone or combined with vagal stimulation, was applied to the right (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) and PVs to induce AF. At baseline, ERPs were lower in PVs than in LA and LAA, but did not differ significantly from RA and RAA, and there was a significant delay in the conduction time from RA to PVs compared with the activation time from RA to LA (P < 0.01). During vagal stimulation, ERP decreased significantly at all sites, without significant differences in the dispersion of refractoriness, and the atrial conduction times changed from 39 \u00b1 19 to 49 \u00b1 9 ms (RA to PVs; n.s.) and from 14 \u00b1 7 to 28 \u00b1 12 ms (RA to LA; P = 0.01). Induction of AF was reproducible in 50% of cases with 50 Hz and in 82% with 50 Hz combined with vagal stimulation (P < 0.05). During vagal stimulation, AF cycle length decreased at all sites, and AF duration changed from 1.0 \u00b1 0.9 to 14.0 \u00b1 10.0 s (P < 0.01), with documentation of PV tachycardia in three cases. In 70% of the animals, AF ceased immediately after interruption of vagal stimulation. We conclude that in the intact rabbit heart, vagal activity prolongs interatrial conduction and shortens atrial and PV ERP, contributing to the vulnerability to the induction and maintenance of AF. This model may be useful in the assessment of the autonomic influence in the mechanisms underlying AF."

The predictive value of preprocedural autoantibodies against beta-1 adrenergic receptor (anti-\u03b21-R) and M2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (anti-M2-R) for AF recurrence following cryoballoon-based pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is still unclear. We aimed to determine the predictive value of preprocedural anti-\u03b21-R and anti-M2-R levels for AF recurrence. METHODS: Eighty patients (mean age 54.25 \u00b1 7.70 years; 40% female) with paroxysmal AF and preserved left ventricular function who underwent cryoballoon-based PVI were included in the study. Preprocedural anti-M2-R and anti-\u03b21-R levels were measured with ELISA. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up after ablation, late AF recurrence was observed in 17 (21.25%) patients. In the Cox regression model, including number of antiarrhythmic drugs, early AF recurrence, anti-\u03b21-R levels >159.88 ng/mL, anti-M2-R levels >277.65 ng/mL, AF duration, and left atrial volume index, only anti-\u03b21-R levels >159.88 ng/mL (HR: 4.281, P = 0.039) and anti-M2-R levels >277.65 ng/mL (HR: 4.313, P = 0.030) were found to be independent predictors of late AF recurrence. Anti-\u03b21-R level >159.88 ng/mL was shown to predict late AF recurrence with a sensitivity of 70.59% and specificity of 90.48%. A cut-off value of 277.65 ng/mL for anti-M2-R level predicted AF recurrence with a sensitivity of 70.59% and specificity of 95.24%. CONCLUSION: Preprocedural serum anti-\u03b21-R and anti-M2-R levels are independent predictors of late AF recurrence following cryoballoon-based PVI in paroxysmal AF patients. Detection of preprocedural anti-\u03b21-R and anti-M2-R levels may serve as a novel method for determination of paroxysmal AF patients who may not benefit from cryoballoon-based PVI."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inducibility of atrial fibrillation (AF) after pulmonary vein isolation has been used to guide additional left atrial ablation in paroxysmal AF. The sensitivity and specificity of AF induction in this setting remains uncertain. We examined the incidence and characteristics of inducible AF in patients without structural heart disease or clinical AF and the effect of different induction protocols on AF inducibility. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 44 patients with supraventricular tachycardia with no history of AF or risk factors for AF, atrial refractoriness and conduction were measured, followed by AF induction attempts (10/patient). Each induction was performed after a waiting time that exceeded twice the duration of induced AF from the preceding induction. AF\u22651 minute was considered inducible, and \u22655 minutes as sustained. Burst pacing (at 200 ms for 10 seconds) was compared to decremental pacing (from 200 ms to shortest cycle length, resulting in 1:1 atrial capture for 10 seconds). After 10 inductions, AF was inducible in 49.5%, and sustained in 29.5% of patients. The incidence of both inducible and sustained AF increased with each induction. Apart from male gender, no clinical or electrophysiological features were associated with sustained AF. Decremental pacing was associated with a higher incidence of sustained AF (41.2% versus 14.8%, P=0.049), longer duration of AF (P=0.006), and shorter mean AF cycle length (P<0.001) compared with burst pacing. CONCLUSIONS: Inducible and sustained AF is common in patients in the absence of structural heart disease or clinical AF, and its incidence varies according to gender, method of induction, and number of inductions. There is a direct relationship between AF persistence and number of inductions, which has not reached a plateau after 10 inductions."

            "abstract": "AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Hyperglycaemia is associated with alpha cell dysfunction, leading to dysregulated glucagon secretion in type 1 and type 2 diabetes; however, the mechanisms involved are still elusive. The nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a major role in the maintenance of alpha cell mass and function. We studied the regulation of alpha cell mTORC1 by nutrients and its role in the development of hyperglucagonaemia in diabetes. METHODS: Alpha cell mTORC1 activity was assessed by immunostaining for phosphorylation of its downstream target, the ribosomal protein S6, and glucagon, followed by confocal microscopy on pancreatic sections and flow cytometry on dispersed human and mouse islets and the alpha cell line, \u03b1TC1-6. Metabolomics and metabolic flux were studied by 13C glucose labelling in 2.8 or 16.7 mmol/l glucose followed by LC-MS analysis. To study the role of mTORC1 in mediating hyperglucagonaemia in diabetes, we generated an inducible alpha cell-specific Rptor knockout in the Akita mouse model of diabetes and tested the effects on glucose tolerance by IPGTT and on glucagon secretion. RESULTS: mTORC1 activity was increased in alpha cells from diabetic Akita mice in parallel to the development of hyperglycaemia and hyperglucagonaemia (two- to eightfold increase). Acute exposure of mouse and human islets to amino acids stimulated alpha cell mTORC1 (3.5-fold increase), whereas high glucose concentrations inhibited mTORC1 (1.4-fold decrease). The mTORC1 response to glucose was abolished in human and mouse diabetic alpha cells following prolonged islet exposure to high glucose levels, resulting in sustained activation of mTORC1, along with increased glucagon secretion. Metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis showed that exposure to high glucose levels enhanced glycolysis, glucose oxidation and the synthesis of glucose-derived amino acids. In addition, chronic exposure to high glucose levels increased the expression of Slc7a2 and Slc38a4, which encode amino acid transporters, as well as the levels of branched-chain amino acids and methionine cycle metabolites (~1.3-fold increase for both). Finally, conditional Rptor knockout in alpha cells from adult diabetic mice inhibited mTORC1, thereby inhibiting glucagon secretion (~sixfold decrease) and improving diabetes, despite persistent insulin deficiency. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Alpha cell exposure to hyperglycaemia enhances amino acid synthesis and transport, resulting in sustained activation of mTORC1, thereby increasing glucagon secretion. mTORC1 therefore plays a major role in mediating alpha cell dysfunction in diabetes.

                "title": "The hepatokine fetuin-A disrupts functional maturation of pancreatic beta cells.",
                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Neonatal beta cells carry out a programme of postnatal functional maturation to achieve full glucose responsiveness. A partial loss of the mature phenotype of adult beta cells may contribute to a reduction of functional beta cell mass and accelerate the onset of type 2 diabetes. We previously found that fetuin-A, a hepatokine increasingly secreted by the fatty liver and a determinant of type 2 diabetes, inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of human islets. Since fetuin-A is a ubiquitous fetal glycoprotein that declines peripartum, we examined here whether fetuin-A interferes with the functional maturity of beta cells. METHODS: The effects of fetuin-A were assessed during in vitro maturation of porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICCs) and in adult human islets. Expression alterations were examined via microarray, RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), proteins were analysed by western blotting and immunostaining, and insulin secretion was quantified in static incubations. RESULTS: NICC maturation was accompanied by the gain of glucose-responsive insulin secretion (twofold stimulation), backed up by mRNA upregulation of genes governing beta cell identity and function, such as NEUROD1, UCN3, ABCC8 and CASR (Log2 fold change [Log2FC]\u2009>\u20091.6). An active TGF\u03b2 receptor (TGFBR)-SMAD2/3 pathway facilitates NICC maturation, since the TGFBR inhibitor SB431542 counteracted the upregulation of aforementioned genes and de-repressed ALDOB, a gene disallowed in mature beta cells. In fetuin-A-treated NICCs, upregulation of beta cell markers and the onset of glucose responsiveness were suppressed. Concomitantly, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was inhibited. Transcriptome analysis confirmed inhibitory effects of fetuin-A and SB431542 on TGF\u03b2-1- and SMAD2/3-regulated transcription. However, contrary to SB431542 and regardless of cMYC upregulation, fetuin-A inhibited beta cell proliferation (0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08% vs 1.0 \u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% Ki67-positive\u2009cells in control NICCs). This effect was sustained by reduced expression (Log2FC\u2009\u2264\u2009-2.4) of FOXM1, CENPA, CDK1 or TOP2A. In agreement, the number of insulin-positive cells was lower in fetuin-A-treated NICCs than in control NICCs (14.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2% and 22.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1%, respectively). In adult human islets fetuin-A abolished glucose responsiveness, i.e. 1.7- and 1.1-fold change over 2.8\u00a0mmol/l glucose in control- and fetuin-A-cultured islets, respectively. In addition, fetuin-A reduced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and suppressed expression of proliferative genes. Of note, in non-diabetic humans, plasma fetuin-A was negatively correlated (p\u2009=\u20090.013) with islet beta cell area. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the perinatal decline of fetuin-A relieves TGFBR signalling in islets, a process that facilitates functional maturation of neonatal beta cells. Functional maturity remains revocable in later life, and the occurrence of a metabolically unhealthy milieu, such as liver steatosis and elevated plasma fetuin-A, can impair both function and adaptive proliferation of beta cells.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Components of insulin/IGF-1 receptor-mediated signaling pathways in pancreatic beta-cells have been implicated in the development of diabetes, in part through the regulation of beta-cell mass in vivo. Studies in vitro have shown that the protein Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) plays a key role as a positive upstream regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway in integrating inputs from nutrients and growth factors for cell growth. Our objective was to investigate the role of the mTORC1 pathway in the regulation of beta-cell mass in vivo. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We generated transgenic mice that overexpress Rheb in beta-cells. We examined the activation of the mTORC1 pathway and its effects on beta-cell mass, on glucose metabolism, and on protection against hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Immunoblots of islet extracts revealed that the phosphorylation levels of ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1, downstream effectors for mTORC1, were upregulated in transgenic beta-cells. Immunostaining of the pancreatic sections with anti-phospho-S6 antibody confirmed upregulation of the mTORC1 pathway in beta-cells in vivo. The mice showed improved glucose tolerance with higher insulin secretion. This arose from increased beta-cell mass accompanied by increased cell size. The mice also exhibited resistance to hyperglycemia induced by streptozotocin and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the mTORC1 pathway by Rheb led to increased beta-cell mass in this mouse model without producing obvious unfavorable effects, giving a potential approach for the treatment of beta-cell failure and diabetes."

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of adjudin, a small molecule identified in a beta cell screen using zebrafish, on pancreatic beta cells and diabetes conditions in mice and human spheroids. METHODS: In zebrafish, insulin expression was examined by bioluminescence and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), glucose levels were examined by direct measurements and distribution using a fluorescent glucose analogue, and calcium activity in beta cells was analysed by in vivo live imaging. Pancreatic islets of wild-type postnatal day 0 (P0) and 3-month-old (adult) mice, as well as adult db/db mice (i.e. BKS(D)-Leprdb/JOrlRj), were cultured in vitro and analysed by qPCR, glucose stimulated insulin secretion and whole mount staining. RNA-seq was performed for islets of P0 and db/db mice. For in vivo assessment, db/db mice were treated with adjudin and subjected to analysis of metabolic variables and islet cells. Glucose consumption was examined in primary human hepatocyte spheroids. RESULTS: Adjudin treatment increased insulin expression and calcium response to glucose in beta cells and decreased glucose levels after beta cell ablation in zebrafish. Adjudin led to improved beta cell function, decreased beta cell proliferation and glucose responsive insulin secretion by decreasing basal insulin secretion in in vitro cultured newborn mouse islets. RNA-seq of P0 islets indicated that adjudin treatment resulted in increased glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function, as well as downstream signalling pathways involved in insulin secretion. In islets from db/db mice cultured in vitro, adjudin treatment strengthened beta cell identity and insulin secretion. RNA-seq of db/db islets indicated adjudin-upregulated genes associated with insulin secretion, membrane ion channel activity and exocytosis. Moreover, adjudin promoted glucose uptake in the liver of zebrafish in an insulin-independent manner, and similarly promoted glucose consumption in primary human hepatocyte spheroids with insulin resistance. In vivo studies using db/db mice revealed reduced nonfasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance and strengthened beta cell identity after adjudin treatment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adjudin promoted functional maturation of immature islets, improved function of dysfunctional islets, stimulated glucose uptake in liver and improved glucose homeostasis in db/db mice. Thus, the multifunctional drug adjudin, previously studied in various contexts and conditions, also shows promise in the management of diabetic states.

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The general population is ageing, involving an enhanced incidence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. With ageing, DNA methylation of FHL2 increases, as well as expression of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) protein in human pancreatic islets. We hypothesised that FHL2 is actively involved in glucose metabolism. METHODS: Publicly available microarray datasets from human pancreatic islets were analysed for FHL2 expression. In FHL2-deficient mice, we studied glucose clearance and insulin secretion. Gene expression analysis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were determined in isolated murine FHL2-deficient islets to evaluate insulin-secretory capacity. Moreover, knockdown and overexpression of FHL2 were accomplished in MIN6 cells to delineate the underlying mechanism of FHL2 function. RESULTS: Transcriptomics of human pancreatic islets revealed that individuals with elevated levels of HbA1c displayed increased FHL2 expression, which correlated negatively with insulin secretion pathways. In line with this observation, FHL2-deficient mice cleared glucose more efficiently than wild-type littermates through increased plasma insulin levels. Insulin sensitivity was comparable between these genotypes. Interestingly, pancreatic islets isolated from FHL2-deficient mice secreted more insulin in GSIS assays than wild-type mouse islets even though insulin content and islet size was similar. To support this observation, we demonstrated increased expression of the transcription factor crucial in insulin secretion, MAF BZIP transcription factor A (MafA), higher expression of GLUT2 and reduced expression of the adverse factor c-Jun in FHL2-deficient islets. The underlying mechanism of FHL2 was further delineated in MIN6 cells. FHL2-knockdown led to enhanced activation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and its downstream genes such as Mafa and Pdx1 (encoding pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1), as well as increased glucose uptake. On the other hand, FHL2 overexpression in MIN6 cells blocked GSIS, increased the formation of reactive oxygen species and increased c-Jun activity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that FHL2 deficiency improves insulin secretion from beta cells and improves glucose tolerance in mice. Given that FHL2 expression in humans increases with age and that high expression levels of FHL2 are associated with beta cell dysfunction, we propose that enhanced FHL2 expression in elderly individuals contributes to glucose intolerance and the development of type 2 diabetes.

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of nutritional status at the cellular and organismic level. While mTORC1 mediates beta cell growth and expansion, its hyperactivation has been observed in pancreatic islets from animal models of type 2 diabetes and leads to beta cell loss. We sought to determine whether such mTORC1 activation occurs in humans with type 2 diabetes or in metabolically stressed human islets and whether mTORC1 blockade can restore beta cell function of diabetic islets. METHODS: Human islets isolated from non-diabetic controls and individuals with type 2 diabetes, as well as human islets and INS-1E cells exposed to increased glucose (22.2\u00a0mmol/l), were examined for mTORC1/2 activity by western blotting analysis of phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), S6 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and mTORC2 downstream targets Akt and N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1). mTORC1/2 complexes' integrity was assessed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent western blot analysis. Cell-type specific expression of activated mTORC1 in human islets was examined by immunostaining of pS6 (Ser 235/236) in human islet sections. Beta cell function was measured by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). RESULTS: While mTORC2 signalling was diminished, mTORC1 activity was markedly increased in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes and in islets and beta cells exposed to increased glucose concentrations. Under high-glucose conditions in metabolically stressed human islets, we identified a reciprocal regulation of different mTOR complexes, with functional upregulation of mTORC1 and downregulation of mTORC2. pS6 immunostaining showed beta cell-specific upregulation of mTORC1 in islets isolated from patients with type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of mTORC1-S6K1 signalling improved GSIS and restored mTORC2 activity in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes as well as in islets isolated from diabetic db/db mice and mice fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data show the aberrant mTORC1 activity in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes, in human islets cultured under diabetes-associated increased glucose conditions and in diabetic mouse islets. This suggests that elevated mTORC1 activation is a striking pathogenic hallmark of islets in type 2 diabetes, contributing to impaired beta cell function and survival in the presence of metabolic stress."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation and m6A-related proteins (methyltransferase-like 3 [METTL3], methyltransferase-like 14 [METTL14] and YTH domain containing 1 [YTHDC1]) have been shown to regulate islet beta cell function and the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, whether Wilms' tumour 1-associating protein (WTAP), a key regulator of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex, regulates islet beta cell failure during pathogenesis of diabetes is largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of WTAP in the regulation of islet beta cell failure and diabetes. METHODS: Islet beta cell-specific Wtap-knockout and beta cell-specific Mettl3-overexpressing mice were generated for this study. Blood glucose, glucose tolerance, serum insulin, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (both in vivo and in vitro), insulin levels, glucagon levels and beta cell apoptosis were examined. RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq were performed, and the data were well analysed. RESULTS: WTAP was downregulated in islet beta cells in type 2 diabetes, due to lipotoxicity and chronic inflammation, and islet beta cell-specific deletion of Wtap (Wtap-betaKO) induced beta cell failure and diabetes. Wtap-betaKO mice showed severe hyperglycaemia (above 20 mmol/l [360 mg/dl]) from 8 weeks of age onwards. Mechanistically, WTAP deficiency decreased m6A mRNA modification and reduced the expression of islet beta cell-specific transcription factors and insulin secretion-related genes by reducing METTL3 protein levels. Islet beta cell-specific overexpression of Mettl3 partially reversed the abnormalities observed in Wtap-betaKO mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: WTAP plays a key role in maintaining beta cell function by regulating m6A mRNA modification depending on METTL3, and the downregulation of WTAP leads to beta cell failure and diabetes.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: While the molecular events controlling insulin secretion from \u03b2-cells have been documented in detail, the exact mechanisms governing glucagon release by \u03b1-cells are understood only partially. This is a critical knowledge gap, as the normal suppression of glucagon secretion by elevated glucose levels fails in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, contributing to hyperglycemia through stimulation of hepatic glucose production. A critical role of glycolytic flux in regulating glucagon secretion was supported by recent studies in which manipulation of the activity and expression of the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase altered the setpoint for glucose-suppression of glucagon secretion (GSGS). Given this precedent, we hypothesized that genetic activation of glucokinase specifically in \u03b1-cells would enhance GSGS and mitigate T2D hyperglucagonemia. METHODS: We derived an inducible, \u03b1-cell-specific glucokinase activating mutant mouse model (GckLoxPGck\u2217/LoxPGck\u2217; Gcg-CreERT2; henceforth referred to as \"\u03b1-mutGCK\") in which the wild-type glucokinase gene (GCK) is conditionally replaced with a glucokinase mutant allele containing the ins454A activating mutation (Gck\u2217), a mutation that increases the affinity of glucokinase for glucose by almost 7-fold. The effects of \u03b1-cell GCK activation on glucose homeostasis, hormone secretion, islet morphology, and islet numbers were assessed using both in\u00a0vivo and ex\u00a0vivo assays. Additionally, the effect of \u03b1-cell GCK activation on GSGS was investigated under diabetogenic conditions of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding that dysregulate glucagon secretion. RESULTS: Our study shows that \u03b1-mutGCK mice have enhanced GSGS in\u00a0vivo and ex\u00a0vivo, independent of alterations in insulin levels and secretion, islet hormone content, islet morphology, or islet number. \u03b1-mutGCK mice maintained on HFD displayed improvements in glucagonemia compared to controls, which developed the expected obesity, glucose intolerance, elevated fasting blood glucose, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglucagonemia. CONCLUSIONS: Using our novel \u03b1-cell specific activation of GCK mouse model, we have provided additional support to demonstrate that the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase is a key determinant in glucose sensing within \u03b1-cells to regulate glucagon secretion. Our results contribute to our fundamental understanding of \u03b1-cell biology by providing greater insight into the regulation of glucagon secretion through \u03b1-cell intrinsic mechanisms via glucokinase. Furthermore, our HFD results underscore the potential of glucokinase as a druggable target which, given the ongoing development of allosteric glucokinase activators (GKAs) for T2D treatment, could help mitigate hyperglucagonemia and potentially improve blood glucose homeostasis."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glucagon is a critical hormone regulating glucose metabolism. It stimulates the liver to release glucose under low blood sugar conditions, thereby maintaining blood glucose stability. Excessive glucagon secretion and hyperglycemia is observed in individuals with diabetes. Precise modulation of glucagon is significant to maintain glucose homeostasis. Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel capable of converting extracellular mechanical forces into intracellular signals, thus regulating hormonal synthesis and secretion. This study aims to investigate the role of Piezo1 in regulating glucagon production in \u03b1 cells. METHODS: The effects of Piezo1 on glucagon production were examined in normal- or high-fat diet fed \u03b1 cell-specific Piezo1 knockout mice (Gcg-Piezo1-/-), and the murine pancreatic \u03b1 cell line \u03b1TC1-6. Expression of Proglucagon was investigated by real-time PCR and western blotting. Plasma glucagon and insulin were detected by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Under both normal- and high-fat diet conditions, Gcg-Piezo1-/- mice exhibited increased pancreatic \u03b1 cell proportion, hyperglucagonemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and activated pancreatic mTORC1 signaling. Activation of Piezo1 by its agonist Yoda1 or overexpression of Piezo1 led to decreased glucagon synthesis and suppressed mTOR signaling pathway in \u03b1TC1-6 cells. Additionally, the levels of glucagon in the medium were also reduced. Conversely, knockdown of Piezo1 produced opposite effects. CONCLUSION: Our study uncovers the regulatory role of the Piezo1 ion channel in \u03b1 cells. Piezo1 influences glucagon production by affecting mTOR signaling pathway."

Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is present within all islet cells, mostly in alpha cells, in both mice and humans. Furthermore, IDE can degrade glucagon as well as insulin, suggesting that IDE may play an important role in alpha cell function in vivo. METHODS: We have generated and characterised a novel mouse model with alpha cell-specific deletion of Ide, the A-IDE-KO mouse line. Glucose metabolism and glucagon secretion in vivo was characterised; isolated islets were tested for glucagon and insulin secretion; alpha cell mass, alpha cell proliferation and \u03b1-synuclein levels were determined in pancreas sections by immunostaining. RESULTS: Targeted deletion of Ide exclusively in alpha cells triggers hyperglucagonaemia and alpha cell hyperplasia, resulting in elevated constitutive glucagon secretion. The hyperglucagonaemia is attributable in part to dysregulation of glucagon secretion, specifically an impaired ability of IDE-deficient alpha cells to suppress glucagon release in the presence of high glucose or insulin. IDE deficiency also leads to \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in alpha cells, which may contribute to impaired glucagon secretion via cytoskeletal dysfunction. We showed further that IDE deficiency triggers impairments in cilia formation, inducing alpha cell hyperplasia and possibly also contributing to dysregulated glucagon secretion and hyperglucagonaemia. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We propose that loss of IDE function in alpha cells contributes to hyperglucagonaemia in type 2 diabetes."

Our previous studies have highlighted the role of nutrient signaling via mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulation that controls glucagon secretion and \u03b1-cell mass. In the current studies we investigated the effects of activation of nutrient signaling by conditional deletion of the mTORC1 inhibitor, TSC2, in \u03b1-cells (\u03b1TSC2KO). We showed that activation of mTORC1 signaling is sufficient to induce chronic hyperglucagonemia as a result of \u03b1-cell proliferation, cell size, and mass expansion. Hyperglucagonemia in \u03b1TSC2KO was associated with an increase in glucagon content and enhanced glucagon secretion. This model allowed us to identify the effects of chronic hyperglucagonemia on glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and resistance to glucagon in the liver. Liver glucagon resistance in \u03b1TSC2KO mice was characterized by reduced expression of the glucagon receptor (GCGR), PEPCK, and genes involved in amino acid metabolism and urea production. Glucagon resistance in \u03b1TSC2KO mice was associated with improved glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced \u03b2-cell destruction and high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance. These studies demonstrate that chronic hyperglucagonemia can improve glucose homeostasis by inducing glucagon resistance in the liver."

                "abstract": "The physiological role of the TGR5 receptor in the pancreas is not fully understood. We previously showed that activation of TGR5 in pancreatic \u03b2 cells by bile acids induces insulin secretion. Glucagon released from pancreatic \u03b1 cells and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal L cells regulate insulin secretion. Both glucagon and GLP-1 are derived from alternate splicing of a common precursor, proglucagon by PC2 and PC1, respectively. We investigated whether TGR5 activation in pancreatic \u03b1 cells enhances hyperglycemia-induced PC1 expression thereby releasing GLP-1, which in turn increases \u03b2 cell mass and function in a paracrine manner. TGR5 activation augmented a hyperglycemia-induced switch from glucagon to GLP-1 synthesis in human and mouse islet \u03b1 cells by GS/cAMP/PKA/cAMP-response element-binding protein-dependent activation of PC1. Furthermore, TGR5-induced GLP-1 release from \u03b1 cells was via an Epac-mediated PKA-independent mechanism. Administration of the TGR5 agonist, INT-777, to db/db mice attenuated the increase in body weight and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. INT-777 augmented PC1 expression in \u03b1 cells and stimulated GLP-1 release from islets of db/db mice compared with control. INT-777 also increased pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation and insulin synthesis. The effect of TGR5-mediated GLP-1 from \u03b1 cells on insulin release from islets could be blocked by GLP-1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that TGR5 activation mediates cross-talk between \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells by switching from glucagon to GLP-1 to restore \u03b2 cell mass and function under hyperglycemic conditions. Thus, INT-777-mediated TGR5 activation could be leveraged as a novel way to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. "

Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART, encoded by Cartpt) affects islet hormone secretion and beta cell survival in vitro in rats, and Cart (-/-) mice have diminished insulin secretion. We aimed to test if CART is differentially regulated in human type 2 diabetic islets and if CART affects insulin and glucagon secretion in vitro in humans and in vivo in mice. METHODS: CART expression was assessed in human type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic control pancreases and rodent models of diabetes. Insulin and glucagon secretion was examined in isolated islets and in vivo in mice. Ca(2+) oscillation patterns and exocytosis were studied in mouse islets. RESULTS: We report an important role of CART in human islet function and glucose homeostasis in mice. CART was found to be expressed in human alpha and beta cells and in a subpopulation of mouse beta cells. Notably, CART expression was several fold higher in islets of type 2 diabetic humans and rodents. CART increased insulin secretion in vivo in mice and in human and mouse islets. Furthermore, CART increased beta cell exocytosis, altered the glucose-induced Ca(2+) signalling pattern in mouse islets from fast to slow oscillations and improved synchronisation of the oscillations between different islet regions. Finally, CART reduced glucagon secretion in human and mouse islets, as well as in vivo in mice via diminished alpha cell exocytosis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that CART is a regulator of glucose homeostasis and could play an important role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Based on the ability of CART to increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion, CART-based agents could be a therapeutic modality in type 2 diabetes."

Treatment of dispersed rat islet cells with elevated glucose and free fatty acids (FFAs, oleate:palmitate = 1:1 v/v) resulted in increases in the size and the number of lipid droplets in \u03b2-cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Glucose and FFAs synergistically stimulated the nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). A potent mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin (25 nM), significantly reduced triglyceride accumulation in rat islets. Importantly, lipid droplets accumulated only in \u03b2-cells but not in \u03b1-cells in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Nutrient activation of mTORC1 upregulated the expression of adipose differentiation related protein (ADRP), known to stabilize lipid droplets. Rat islet size and new DNA synthesis also increased under nutrient overload. Insulin secretion into the culture medium increased steadily over a 4-day period without any significant difference between glucose (10 mM) alone and the combination of glucose (10 mM) and FFAs (240 \u03bcM). Insulin content and insulin biosynthesis, however, were significantly reduced under the combination of nutrients compared with glucose alone. Elevated nutrients also stimulated lipid droplet formation in human islets in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Unlike rat islets, however, human islets did not increase in size under nutrient overload despite a normal response to nutrients in releasing insulin. The different responses of islet cell growth under nutrient overload appear to impact insulin biosynthesis and storage differently in rat and human islets."

Without affecting \u00df-cell mass or circulating insulin, diabetic mice that received SRT3025 had substantially improved glycaemic control with greatly reduced islet \u03b1 cell mass and lower plasma glucagon concentrations. Consistent with reduced glucagon abundance, the diabetes-associated overexpression of key gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase and PEPCK were also lowered by SRT3025. Incubating cultured \u03b1 cells with SRT3025 diminished their glucagon secretion and proliferative activity in association with a reduction in the \u03b1 cell associated transcription factor, Aristaless Related Homeobox (Arx). By reducing the paradoxical increase in glucagon, SIRT1 activation may offer a new, \u03b1-cell centric approach to the treatment of type 1 diabetes."

                "abstract": "Glucagon plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis during fed and fasting states. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of pancreatic \u03b1 cell mass and function are not completely understood. In the current study, we identified mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) as a major regulator of \u03b1 cell mass and glucagon secretion. Using mice with tissue-specific deletion of the mTORC1 regulator Raptor in \u03b1 cells (\u03b1RaptorKO), we showed that mTORC1 signaling is dispensable for \u03b1 cell development, but essential for \u03b1 cell maturation during the transition from a milk-based diet to a chow-based diet after weaning. Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in \u03b1RaptorKO mice and in WT animals exposed to chronic rapamycin administration decreased glucagon content and glucagon secretion. In \u03b1RaptorKO mice, impaired glucagon secretion occurred in response to different secretagogues and was mediated by alterations in KATP channel subunit expression and activity. Additionally, our data identify the mTORC1/FoxA2 axis as a link between mTORC1 and transcriptional regulation of key genes responsible for \u03b1 cell function. Thus, our results reveal a potential function of mTORC1 in nutrient-dependent regulation of glucagon secretion and identify a role for mTORC1 in controlling \u03b1 cell-mass maintenance."

                "abstract": "Diabetes is defined by hyperglycaemia due to progressive insulin resistance and compromised insulin release. In parallel, alpha cells develop dysregulation of glucagon secretion. Diabetic patients have insufficient glucagon secretion during hypoglycaemia and a lack of inhibition of glucagon secretion at higher blood glucose levels resulting in postprandial hyperglucagonaemia, which contributes to the development of hyperglycaemia. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an efficient pharmacologic approach for the treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. While SGLT2 inhibitors aim at increasing glycosuria to decrease blood glucose levels, these inhibitors also increase circulating glucagon concentrations. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how SGLTs are involved in the regulation of glucagon secretion. Sodium plays an important role for alpha cell function, and a tight regulation of intracellular sodium levels is important for maintaining plasma membrane potential and intracellular pH. This involves the sodium-potassium pump, sodium-proton exchangers and SGLTs. While the expression of SGLT2 in alpha cells remains controversial, SGLT1 seems to play a central role for alpha cell function. Under hyperglycaemic conditions, SGLT1 mediated accumulation of sodium results in alpha cell dysregulation due to altered cellular acidification and ATP production. Taken together, this suggests that SGLT1 could be a promising, yet highly underappreciated drug target to restore alpha cell function and improve treatment of both type 1 and 2 diabetes."

                "abstract": "We have previously reported that obesity-induced diabetes developed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed BDF1 mice. This is caused by insufficient insulin response to an excess glucose load. In this study, we have shown that the enhanced expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (Raldh3) causes functional disorders of pancreatic islets in diabetic mouse models. In the pancreatic islets of HFD-induced diabetic BDF1 mice and spontaneously diabetic C57BL/KsJ(db/db) mice, gene expression analysis with oligonucleotide microarray revealed a significant increase in Raldh3 expression. Exposure to a culture medium containing a higher glucose concentration (25 mM) significantly increased Raldh3 expression in murine MIN6 and alphaTC1 clone 9 cells, which derived from the \u03b1 and \u03b2-cells of pancreatic islets, respectively. Overexpression of Raldh3 reduced the insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, and surprisingly, increased the glucagon secretion in alphaTC1 clone 9 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of Raldh3 expression with siRNA decreased the glucagon secretion in alphaTC1 clone 9 cells. Raldh3 catalyzes the conversion of 13-cis retinal to 13-cis retinoic acid and we revealed that 13-cis retinoic acid significantly reduces cell viability in MIN6 and alphaTC1 clone 9 cells, but not in cells of H4IIEC3, 3T3-L1, and COS-1 cell lines. These findings suggest that an increasing expression of Raldh3 deregulates the balanced mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion in the pancreatic islets and may induce \u03b2-cell dysfunction leading to the development of type 2 diabetes."

                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Glucagon-stimulated hepatic gluconeogenesis contributes to endogenous glucose production during fasting. Recent studies suggest that TGF-\u03b2 is able to promote hepatic gluconeogenesis in mice. However, the physiological relevance of serum TGF-\u03b2 levels to human glucose metabolism and the mechanism by which TGF-\u03b2 enhances gluconeogenesis remain largely unknown. As enhanced gluconeogenesis is a signature feature of type 2 diabetes, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-\u03b2-promoted hepatic gluconeogenesis would allow us to better understand the process of normal glucose production and the pathophysiology of this process in type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of upregulated TGF-\u03b21 in human type 2 diabetes and the molecular mechanism underlying the action of TGF-\u03b21 in glucose metabolism. METHODS: Serum levels of TGF-\u03b21 were measured by ELISA in 74 control participants with normal glucose tolerance and 75 participants with type 2 diabetes. Human liver tissue was collected from participants without obesity and with or without type 2 diabetes for the measurement of TGF-\u03b21 and glucagon signalling. To investigate the role of Smad3, a key signalling molecule downstream of the TGF-\u03b21 receptor, in mediating the effect of TGF-\u03b21 on glucagon signalling, we generated Smad3 knockout mice. Glucose levels in Smad3 knockout mice were measured during prolonged fasting and a glucagon tolerance test. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from Smad3 knockout and wild-type (WT) mice to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Smad3 phosphorylation was detected by western blotting, levels of cAMP were detected by ELISA and levels of protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation were detected by western blotting. The dissociation of PKA subunits was measured by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: We observed higher levels of serum TGF-\u03b21 in participants without obesity and with type 2 diabetes than in healthy control participants, which was positively correlated with HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels. In addition, hyperactivation of the CREB and Smad3 signalling pathways was observed in the liver of participants with type 2 diabetes. Treating WT mouse primary hepatocytes with TGF-\u03b21 greatly potentiated glucagon-stimulated PKA/CREB phosphorylation and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Mechanistically, TGF-\u03b21 treatment induced the binding of Smad3 to the regulatory subunit of PKA (PKA-R), which prevented the association of PKA-R with the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) and led to the potentiation of glucagon-stimulated PKA signalling and gluconeogenesis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The hepatic TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 pathway sensitises the effect of glucagon/PKA signalling on gluconeogenesis and synergistically promotes hepatic glucose production. Reducing serum levels of TGF-\u03b21 and/or preventing hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signalling could be a novel approach for alleviating hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes."

                "title": "NRF2 is required for neonatal mouse beta cell growth by maintaining redox balance and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and function.",
                "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: All forms of diabetes result from insufficient functional beta cell mass. Due to the relatively limited expression of several antioxidant enzymes, beta cells are highly vulnerable to pathological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to the reduction of functional beta cell mass. During early postnatal ages, both human and rodent beta cells go through a burst of proliferation that quickly declines with age. The exact mechanisms that account for neonatal beta cell proliferation are understudied but mitochondrial release of moderated ROS levels has been suggested as one of the main drivers. We previously showed that, apart from its conventional role in protecting beta cells from oxidative stress, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is also essential for beta cell proliferation. We therefore hypothesised that NRF2, which is activated by ROS, plays an essential role in beta cell proliferation at early postnatal ages. METHODS: Beta cell NRF2 levels and beta cell proliferation were measured in pancreatic sections from non-diabetic human cadaveric donors at different postnatal ages, childhood and adulthood. Pancreatic sections from 1-, 7-, 14- and 28-day-old beta cell-specific Nrf2 (also known as Nfe2l2)-knockout mice (\u03b2Nrf2KO) or control (Nrf2lox/lox) mice were assessed for beta cell NRF2 levels, beta cell proliferation, beta cell oxidative stress, beta cell death, nuclear beta cell pancreatic duodenal homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) levels and beta cell mass. Seven-day-old \u03b2Nrf2KO and Nrf2lox/lox mice were injected daily with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or saline (154 mmol/l NaCl) to explore the potential contribution of oxidative stress to the phenotypes seen in \u03b2Nrf2KO mice at early postnatal ages. RNA-seq was performed on 7-day-old \u03b2Nrf2KO and Nrf2lox/lox mice to investigate the mechanisms by which NRF2 stimulates beta cell proliferation at early postnatal ages. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function were determined using dispersed islets from 7-day-old \u03b2Nrf2KO and Nrf2lox/lox mice by measuring MitoTracker intensity, mtDNA/gDNA ratio and ATP/ADP ratio. To study the effect of neonatal beta cell-specific Nrf2 deletion on glucose homeostasis in adulthood, blood glucose, plasma insulin and insulin secretion were determined and a GTT was performed on 3-month-old \u03b2Nrf2KO and Nrf2lox/lox mice fed on regular diet (RD) or high-fat diet (HFD). RESULTS: The expression of the master antioxidant regulator NRF2 was increased at early postnatal ages in both human (1 day to 19 months old, 31%) and mouse (7 days old, 57%) beta cells, and gradually declined with age (8% in adult humans, 3.77% in adult mice). A significant correlation (R2=0.568; p=0.001) was found between beta cell proliferation and NRF2 levels in human beta cells. Seven-day-old \u03b2Nrf2KO mice showed reduced beta cell proliferation (by 65%), beta cell nuclear PDX1 levels (by 23%) and beta cell mass (by 67%), and increased beta cell oxidative stress (threefold) and beta cell death compared with Nrf2lox/lox control mice. NAC injections increased beta cell proliferation in 7-day-old \u03b2Nrf2KO mice (3.4-fold) compared with saline-injected \u03b2Nrf2KO mice. Interestingly, RNA-seq of islets isolated from 7-day-old \u03b2Nrf2KO mice revealed reduced expression of mitochondrial RNA genes and genes involved in the electron transport chain. Islets isolated from 7-day old \u03b2Nrf2KO mice presented reduced MitoTracker intensity (by 47%), mtDNA/gDNA ratio (by 75%) and ATP/ADP ratio (by 68%) compared with islets from Nrf2lox/lox littermates. Lastly, HFD-fed 3-month-old \u03b2Nrf2KO male mice displayed a significant reduction in beta cell mass (by 35%), a mild increase in non-fasting blood glucose (1.2-fold), decreased plasma insulin (by 14%), and reduced glucose tolerance (1.3-fold) compared with HFD-fed Nrf2lox/lox mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights NRF2 as an essential transcription factor for maintaining neonatal redox balance, mitochondrial biogenesis and function and beta cell growth, and for preserving functional beta cell mass in adulthood under metabolic stress.

                "title": "Diabetes and branched-chain amino acids: What is the link?",
                "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have increasingly been studied as playing a role in diabetes, with the PubMed search string \"diabetes\" AND \"branched chain amino acids\" showing particular growth in studies of the topic over the past decade (Fig. ). In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and tyrosine and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg2+ /Mn2+ dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut microbiota may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies."

In this context, this article investigated the antinociceptive activity of \u03b1-PHE using in vivo Sarcoma-180-induced hypernociception in mice to detail its mechanism(s) of antinociception under different conditions of treatment and tumor progression. Firsty, in vitro cytotoxic action was assessed using melanoma B-16/F-10 and S-180 murine cells and colorimetric MTT assays. For in vivo studies, acute treatment with \u03b1-PHE (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg orally by gavage) was performed on the 1st day after S-180 inoculation. Subacute treatments were performed for 8\u00a0days starting on the next day (early protocol) or on day 8 after S-180 inoculation (late protocol). For all procedures, mechanical nociceptive evaluations were carried out by von Frey's technique in the subaxillary region peritumoral tissue (direct nociception) and in right legs of S-180-bearing mice (indirect nociception). \u03b1-PHE showed in vitro cytotoxic action on B-16/F-10 and S-180 (CI50 values of 436.0 and 217.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), inhibition of in vivo tumor growth (ranging from 47.3 to 82.7%) and decreased direct (peritumoral tissue in subaxillary region) and indirect (right leg) mechanical nociception in Sarcoma 180-bearing mice with early and advanced tumors under acute or subacute conditions of treatment especially at doses of 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg. It improved serum levels of GSH as well as diminished systemic lipid peroxidation, blood cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, -4, -6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1). Such outcomes highlight \u03b1-PHE as a promising lead compound that combines antinociceptive and antineoplasic properties. Its structural simplicity make it a cost-effective alternative, justifying further mechanistic investigations and the development of pharmaceutical formulations. Moreover, the protocols developed and standardized here make it possible to use Sarcoma-180 hypernociception model to evaluate the capacity of new antinociceptive molecules under conditions of cancer-related allodynia."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi leaves have been used in folk medicine due to several properties, including antitumor and analgesic effects. The variable efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic drugs have motivated the search for novel antinociceptive agents. It has been reported that the S. terebinthifolia leaf lectin (SteLL) has antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 in mice. AIM OF THE STUDY: This work aimed to evaluate whether SteLL would reduce cancer pain using an orthotopic tumor model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sarcoma 180\u00a0cell suspension was inoculated into the right hind paws of mice, and the treatments (150\u00a0mM NaCl, negative control; 10\u00a0mg/kg morphine, positive control; or SteLL at 1 and 2\u00a0mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally 24\u00a0h after cell inoculation up to 14 days. Spontaneous nociception, mechanical hyperalgesia, and hot-plate tests were performed. Further, the volume and weight of the tumor-bearing paws were measured. RESULTS: SteLL (2\u00a0mg/kg) improved limb use during ambulation. The lectin (1 and 2\u00a0mg/kg) also inhibited mechanical hyperalgesia and increased the latency time during the hot-plate test. Naloxone was found to reverse this effect, indicating the involvement of opioid receptors. The tumor-bearing paws of mice treated with SteLL exhibited lower volume and weight. CONCLUSION: SteLL reduced hyperalgesia due to sarcoma 180 in the paws of mice, and this effect can be related to its antitumor action."

KEY FINDINGS: CARV was able to significantly reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and spontaneous and palpation-induced nociception, improve use paw, decrease the number of positively marked neurons in lumbar spinal cord and activate periaqueductal gray, nucleus raphe magnus and locus coeruleus. CARV also caused significant decreased tumor growth. Docking studies showed favorable interaction overlay of the CARV with IL-10 and GABAA.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Opioid effectiveness to treat cancer pain is often compromised by the development of tolerance and the occurrence of undesirable side effects, particularly during long-term treatment. Hence, the search for more efficient analgesics remains a necessity. The main goal of this study was to relieve neuropathic symptoms associated with tumour growth by administering the non-opioid analgesic dipyrone (DIP) alone or in combination with magnesium chloride (MgCl2 ), an adjuvant that blocks the NMDA receptor channel. METHODS: Mice were inoculated with a melanoma cell line (B16-BL6) in the left thigh and two protocols were used to evaluate the effect of DIP (270\u00a0mg/kg), MgCl2 (200\u00a0mg/kg), or the combination DIP-MgCl2 . In the therapeutic protocol the drugs, alone or combined, were administered once tumour had promoted increased nociception. In the preventive protocol, drugs were administered prior to the appearance of the primary tumour. Tumour growth was assessed with a caliper and nociception was determined using behavioural tests. RESULTS: DIP promoted antinociception only at the beginning of both protocols due to the development of tolerance. The combination DIP-MgCl2 improved the antinociceptive effect, avoiding tolerance and reducing tumour growth in the preventive treatment, more efficiently than each compound alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DIP-MgCl2 may represent a safe, affordable and accessible option to reduce tumour growth and to treat cancer pain avoiding the risk of tolerance, without the typical complications of opioids agents, particularly when long-term treatment is required. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows a non-opioid analgesic combined with an adjuvant as a therapeutic option to treat cancer pain. The avoidance of antinociceptive tolerance when repeated administration is required, as well as tumor growth reduction, are additional advantages to be considered."

We employed a murine model to study whether gabapentin was able to regulate tumor growth, in addition to controlling hyperalgesic symptoms.

In the preventive protocol, gabapentin was administered before the appearance of the positive signs. Additionally, in vitro experiments were performed to determine gabapentin's effects on cell-line proliferation, the secretion of the chemokine CCL2, and calcium influx. In the therapeutically treated animals, baseline responses to noxious stimuli were recovered, and tumors were significantly reduced. Similarly, gabapentin reduced tumor growth during the preventive treatment, but a relapse was noticed when the administration stopped. Gabapentin also inhibited cell proliferation, the secretion of CCL2, and calcium influx. These results suggest that gabapentin might represent a multivalent strategy to control cancer-associated events in painful tumors."

                "title": "Synergistic combinations of the dual enkephalinase inhibitor PL265 given orally with various analgesic compounds acting on different targets, in a murine model of cancer-induced bone pain.",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The first line pharmacological treatment of cancer pain is morphine and surrogates but a significant pain relief and a reduction of the side-effects of these compounds makes it necessary to combine them with other drugs acting on different targets. The aim of this study was to measure the antinociceptive effect on cancer-induced bone pain resulting from the association of the endogenous opioids enkephalin and non-opioid analgesic drugs. For this purpose, PL265 a new orally active single dual inhibitor of the two degrading enkephalins enzymes, neprilysin (NEP) and aminopeptidase N (APN) was used. It strictly increased the levels of enkephalin at their sites of releases. The selected non-opioid compounds are: gabapentin, A-317491 (P2X3 receptor antagonist), ACEA (CB1 receptor antagonist), AM1241 (CB2 receptor antagonist), JWH-133 (CB2 receptor antagonist), URB937 (FAAH inhibitor), and NAV26 (Nav1.7 channel blocker). METHODS: Experiments. Experiments were performed in 5-6 weeks old (26-33g weight) C57BL/6 mice. Cell culture and cell inoculation. B16-F10 melanoma cells were cultured and when preconfluent, treated and detached. Finally related cells were resuspended to obtain a concentration of 2\u00d7106 cells/100\u03bcL. Then 105 cells were injected into the right tibial medullar cavity. Control mice were treated by killed cells by freezing. Behavioural studies. Thermal withdrawal latencies were measured on a unilatered hot plate (UHP) maintained at 49\u00b10.2\u00b0C. Mechanical threshold values were obtained by performing the von Frey test using the \"up and down\" method. To evaluate the nature (additive or synergistic) of the interactions between PL265 and different drugs, an isobolographic analysis following the method described by Tallarida was performed. RESULTS: The results demonstrate the ability of PL265, a DENKI that prevents the degradation of endogenous ENKs, to counteract cancer-induced bone thermal hyperalgesia in mice, by exclusively stimulating peripheral opioid receptors as demonstrated by used of an opioid antagonist unable to enter the brain. The development of such DENKIs, endowed with druggable pharmacokinetic characteristics, such as good absorption by oral route, can be considered as an important step in the development of much needed novel antihyperalgesic drugs. Furthermore, all the tested combinations resulted in synergistic antihyperalgesic effects. As shown here, the greatest synergistic antinociceptive effect (doses could be lowered by 70%) was produced by the combination of PL265 with the P2X3 receptor antagonist (A-317491), cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist (exogenous, ACEA and endogenous URB937-protected-AEA) and Nav1.7 blocker (NAV26) whose mechanism of action involves the direct activation of the enkephalinergic system. CONCLUSIONS: These multi-target-based antinociceptive strategies using combinations of non-opioid drugs with dual inhibitors of enkephalin degrading enzymes may bring therapeutic advantages in terms of efficacy and safety by allowing the reduction of doses of one of the compounds or of both, which is of the utmost interest in the chronic treatment of cancer pain. IMPLICATIONS: This article presents synergistic antinociceptive effect produced by the combination of PL265 with non-opioid analgesic drugs acting via unrelated mechanisms. These multi-target-based antinociceptive strategies may bring therapeutic advantages by allowing the reduction of doses, which is of great interest in the chronic treatment of cancer pain."

                "abstract": "Aggressive breast cancer subtypes utilize system xc-, a membrane antiporter, to import cystine for glutathione synthesis and maintenance of redox homeostasis, in turn releasing glutamate as a metabolic pro-nociceptive by-product. Metastatic breast cancers establish themselves at distal sites including bone, where changes in extracellular glutamate levels contribute to cancer-induced bone pain. We previously established that stearically blocking system xc- activity with sulfasalazine delays the onset of nociceptive behaviours and that xCT, the functional antiporter subunit, is positively regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In the current investigation, a murine xenograft cancer-induced bone pain model was applied to examine whether pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) induces changes in nociception. A high glutamate-releasing, xCT/pSTAT3 over-expressing human breast cancer cell line was selected for injection into the distal epiphysis of the right femur of female nude mice. A 14-day regimen of intraperitoneal injections with either vehicle or the novel STAT3 inhibitor DR-1-55 commenced three weeks after initial intrafemoral bone injection. Nociceptive behaviours were temporally monitored by automated von Frey, dynamic weight bearing and open-field testing for the duration of the study, beginning at the baseline. Prior to sacrifice and at ethical end point, tumour-induced osteolytic lesions were radiographically assessed. Treatment with DR-1-55 significantly delayed the onset and severity of spontaneous and induced nociceptive behaviours, also decreasing human SLC7A11 ( xCT) mRNA levels in tumour-bearing limbs without altering osteolysis. In addition, two pro-inflammatory cytokines released by this cell line, interleukin 6 and interleukin 1\u03b2, were also down-regulated at the mRNA level in response to DR-1-55 treatment in vivo, with lower human interleukin 6 levels detected in the host circulation. This study demonstrates that targeting pSTAT3 may be a viable therapeutic means to manage cancer-induced bone pain, alone or in combination with stearic system xc- blockers."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Arenga pinnata (Wurmb) Merr. is a medicinal and edible plant belonging to family Palmae. The fruits of this plant were used in traditional folk medicine due to its analgesia and anti-inflammatory activities. This study aimed to investigate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and the mechanism of the ethanol extract of A. pinnata (Wurmb) Merr. fruit (EAF) on different experimental models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the chromatographic profile and to analyze the composition of EAF. In the acute toxicity test, all mice were orally administered EAF at a maximum dosage of 26\u00a0g/kg and were then monitored for 14 days. The potential analgesic activity of EAF was evaluated by using animal pain models, namely the acetic acid-induced writhing test and the hot plate test in mice. The underlying mechanisms of analgesia were determined by pretreating with naloxone, capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde to evaluate the involvement of the opioid system and transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels). The anti-inflammatory activity of EAF was evaluated by using the following inflammatory animal models: xylene-induced ear edema in mice and Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced paw swelling in rats. EAF was orally administered at the doses of 1.625, 3.25 and 6.5\u00a0g/kg in mice and 1.125, 2.25 and 4.5\u00a0g/kg in rats. The underlying mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and real time-PCR used to measure the expression levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression levels of proteins related to the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways in paw tissues. RESULTS: Five compounds, namely (5-(hydroxymethyl) furan-2-yl) methanediol,4'-hydroxy-N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoyl)-3',5'-dimethoxybenzamide, (+)-lyonirenisol-3a-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, (-)-lyonirenisol-3a-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside and liquiritin, were firstly identified from A. pinnata (Wurmb) Merr. fruit by HPLC-UV analysis. In the acute toxicity test, no treatment-related toxicological signs or mortality was observed in mice administered doses up to 26\u00a0g/kg. Bodyweight was not obviously different among the treatment groups and the vehicle group. EAF significantly inhibited the pain response induced by acetic acid and increased the latency time in the hot plate test in mice. The anti-nociception effect of EAF in the formalin test was not alleviated by pretreatment with naloxone. However, the nociception induced by injection with capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde was significantly reduced by EAF. Compared with vehicle treatment, EAF significantly inhibited the formation of xylene-induced ear edema and CFA adjuvant-induced paw swelling. EAF markedly inhibited the production of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, PGE2 and IL-6 induced by CFA in paw tissues. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b1, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK and the nuclear translation of NF-\u03baB p65 induced by CFA in paw tissues were significantly inhibited by EAF treatment compared with vehicle treatment. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study provides pharmacological evidence for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of EAF and the underlying mechanism, suggesting that EAF might be a potential candidate for reducing pain and inflammatory disorders."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncological pain is one of the most prevalent and difficult-to-treat symptoms in patients with cancer. p-Cymene (PC) is a monoterpene found in more than 100 different plant species, endowed with various pharmacological properties-particularly antinociceptive. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: PC has antinociceptive effect in a model of oncologic pain due to the activation of the descending inhibitory pathway of pain. STUDY DESIGN: A pre-clinical, longitudinal, blind and randomized study. METHODS: Male Swiss mice were induced with S180 cells in the right hind paw, then treated daily with PC (12.5, 25 and 50\u202fmg/kg, s.c.) and screened for mechanical hyperalgesia, spontaneous nociception, nociception induced by non-noxious palpation, tumor growth, changes in the neuromuscular function and existence of bone degradation in the tumor area. The effect of PC on Ca2+ currents (electrophysiological records), histological and neurochemical changes (immunofluorescence for Fos) were also evaluated. RESULTS: PC reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the mechanical hyperalgesia, the spontaneous (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and non-noxious palpation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) nociceptions, not changing the tumor development, neuromuscular function or histopathological aspects of the paw affected. PC reduced Fos expression in the spinal cord (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and increased this expression in the PAG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and in the NRM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). PC decreased the density of calcium channel currents (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest the antinociceptive effect of PC on oncologic pain, probably acting in both ascending and descending pain pathways, and modulating the calcium channel currents in order to exert its effects."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bougainvillea spectabilis is an ornamental shrub from Nyctaginaceae family, widely used in the traditional medicine in the treatment of pain, inflammation, and ulcer. Some research investigated the analgesic potential of this plant, however, the in-depth analysis of its antinociceptive properties and molecular mechanism(s) are yet to be revealed. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This study, therefore, investigated the antinociceptive potential of methanol extract of the leaves of B. spectabilis (MEBS) with possible molecular mechanism(s) of action using several pre-clinical models of acute and chronic pain in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dry leaf powder of B. spectabilis was macerated with 100% methanol, and then dried crude extract was used for in vivo experiments. Following the acute toxicity test with 500, 1000, and 2000\u00a0mg/kg b.w. doses of MEBS, the central antinociceptive activities of the extract (50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) were evaluated using hot plate and tail immersion tests, whereas the peripheral activities were investigated using acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin-induced licking and oedema, and glutamate-induced licking tests. Moreover, the possible involvements of cGMP and ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathways in the observed antinociceptive activities were also investigated using methylene blue (20\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) and glibenclamide (10\u00a0mg/kg b.w.), respectively. We also performed GC/MS-MS analysis of MEBS to identify the phyto-constituents and in silico modelling of the major compounds for potential molecular targets. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that MEBS at 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/kg b.w. doses were not effective enough to suppress centrally mediated pain in the hot plate and tail immersion models. However, the extract was potent (at 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg b.w. doses) in reducing peripheral nociception in the acetic acid-induced writhing and inflammatory phase of the formalin tests. Further analyses revealed that MEBS could interfere with glutamatergic system, cGMP and ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathways to show its antinociceptive properties. GC/MS-MS analysis revealed 35 different phytochemicals with potent anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties including phytol, neophytadiene, 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol, fucoxanthin, and Vit-E. Prediction analysis showed high intestinal absorptivity and low toxicity profiles of these compounds with capability to interact with glutamatergic system, inhibit JAK/STAT pathway, scavenge nitric oxide and oxygen radicals, and inhibit expression of COX3, tumor necrosis factor, and histamine. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggested the antinociceptive potentials of MEBS which were mediated through the modulation of glutamatergic, cGMP, and ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathways. These also suggested that MEBS could be beneficial in the treatment of complications associated with nociceptive pain."

Our results showed that TP reduced significantly mechanical hyperalgesia and spontaneous and palpation-induced nociception, improved paw use without reducing tumor growth and grip strength. Importantly, no evident biochemical and hematological toxicity was oberved. Furthermore, TP increased the tissue antioxidant capacity due to ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and glutathione (GSH). TP also reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunocontent in the tumors. Molecular docking estimated that TP binds within the same range of iNOS regions (other iNOS inhibitors), such as N-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). These data provide strong evidence that TP may be an interesting candidate for the development of new safe analgesic drugs that are effective for cancer pain control."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The medicinal plant Pterodon pubescens Benth has been traditionally used for a long time to treat rheumatic diseases due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. The present study aims to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of ethanolic extract from P. pubescens fruits (EEPp) in a model of neuropathic pain in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phytochemical analysis of EEPp was performed through GC-MS, HPLC and colorimetric analysis. The antinociceptive effects of EEPp (30-300 mg/kg, i.g.) were evaluated on mechanical and thermal (cold or heat) hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) in mice. We also investigated the effects of EEPp on the nociceptive response induced by intrathecal injection (i.t.) of ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA and kainate) and metabotropic (trans-ACPD) glutamate receptor agonists, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, as well as TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists. In addition, we also investigated the safety profile of prolonged treatment with EEPp in mice. RESULTS: The phytochemical analysis showed a higher amount terpenes, being nine sesquiterpenes and seven diterpenes with vouacapan skeletons, as well as a small amount of phenols and flavonoids. The exact mechanism by which EEPp promotes its antinociceptive effect is not yet fully understood, but its oral administration causes significant inhibition of glutamate-, kainate-, NMDA-, trans-ACPD-induced biting responses, as well as of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) and TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels activators (capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde, respectively). These results may indicate, at least in part, some of the mechanisms that are involved in this effect. In particular, EEPp decreases neuropathic pain and clearly shows, for the first time, a thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia reduction in the model of partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL), without inducing tolerance. Furthermore, the prolonged treatment with EEPp (300 mg/kg, i.g.) showed a cumulative effect over 24h, in the 15th day, after last treatment. In addition, the open-field test showed that doses up to 300 mg/kg in both treatments, acute and/or prolonged, did not affect the motor activity of mice. Also, EEPp showed no toxicity according to the serum levels of the renal and hepatic injury indicators or observed macroscopic organs, after PSNL. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results provide the first experimental evidence of the significant antinociceptive effect of EEPp on neuropathic pain without causing side effects, such as sedation or locomotor dysfunction. Moreover, these results appear to be mediated, at least in part, by the inhibition of glutamatergic receptors, TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, this study adds new scientific evidence and highlights the therapeutic potential of the medicinal plant P. pubescens in the development of phytomedicines for the management of neuropathic pain."

Transient potential receptor ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is related to the onset of cancer and neuropathic pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the involvement of TRPA1 in a model of breast carcinoma. We injected 4T1 cells in the fourth caudal mammary fat pad of female BALB/c mice, and after 20 days we observed mechanical and cold allodynia and spontaneous nociception behavior (mouse grimace scale detection, MGS). TRPA1 selective antagonist (HC-030031 or A-967079) administration or intrathecal administration of TRPA1 antisense (AS) oligonucleotide was performed. The activity of NADPH oxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were evaluated. The chemical hyperalgesia produced by a TRPA1 agonist (allyl isothiocyanate, AITC) was also detected. The administration of TRPA1 antagonists, TRPA1 AS, or antioxidant, transiently attenuated MGS, or mechanical and cold allodynia. Intraplantar injection of AITC also caused nociception. NADPH oxidase or SOD activity and H2O2 levels were increased in the sciatic nerve and hind paw skin samples. The 4T1 cells did not express TRPA1, and the use of HC-030031 or \u03b1-lipoic acid did not reduce the cytotoxic effect of a chemotherapeutic drug (paclitaxel). Thus, TRPA1 could be investigated as a target for breast carcinoma pain treatment."

METHODS: Mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the purity and molecular mass of \u03b1-PHE. Macrophages from mice peritoneal cavity were used in an MTT test. Rodents were used in tests of chemical and mechanical nociception. In the study of the mechanisms, the animals were treated with pharmacological tools and then submitted to the glutamate test. KEY FINDINGS: \u03b1-PHE purity was 98.2% and molecular mass 136.1 Da. \u03b1-PHE did not show cytotoxicity. In the writhing and capsaicin tests, \u03b1-PHE promoted the antinociceptive effect in all evaluated doses (minimum dose 3.125 mg/kg). In the formalin test, \u03b1-PHE (50 mg/kg) was effective in inhibiting both phases. In the glutamate test, the monoterpene (12.5 mg/kg) decreased the nociceptive response. In carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia, \u03b1-PHE (50 mg/kg) decreased the hypernociception index. In the study of the mechanisms involved, pretreatment with naloxone reversed the \u03b1-PHE antinociceptive effect, the same occurred with glibenclamide, l-arginine, atropine and yohimbine. \u03b1-PHE did not show muscle relaxant activity or central depressant effects in open field and rota rod tests. CONCLUSIONS: \u03b1-PHE has an antinociceptive effect and it possibly involves the glutamatergic, opioid, nitrergic, cholinergic and adrenergic systems."

Drugs available for the treatment of inflammatory pain are not fully effective and show adverse effects. Thus, we investigated the antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic effects of bis(3-amino-2-pyridine) diselenide (BAPD), a new analgesic drug prototype. BAPD effects were investigated using nociception models induced by chemical (glutamate), immunologic (Freund's Complete Adjuvant - CFA) and thermal stimuli in Swiss mice. Mice were orally (p.o.) treated with BAPD (0.1-50\u202fmg/kg) 30\u202fmin prior to the glutamate and hot-plate tests and a time-course (0.5 up to 8\u202fh) of the antinociceptive effect of BAPD (50\u202fmg/kg, p. o.) was evaluated in a CFA model. In the CFA model, BAPD effects on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3) expression, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, oxidative (2,2'-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonic acid and 2,2-diphe- nyl-1-picrylhydrazyl levels) and histological parameters were evaluated. The safety of the compound (50 and 300\u202fmg/kg, p. o.) was verified for 72\u202fh. BAPD reduced the licking time induced by glutamate and caused an increase in latency response to thermal stimulus. Naloxone reversed the antinociceptive effect of BAPD. Paw edema formation induced by glutamate or CFA injection was reduced by BAPD. Mechanical hyperalgesia induced by CFA was attenuated by BAPD. BAPD did not protect against the increase in MPO activity and decrease of the 2,2'-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonic acid and 2,2-diphe- nyl-1-picrylhydrazyl levels induced by CFA. BAPD protected against histological alterations and reduction on the levels of gene expression COX-2 and INF-\u03b3 in the paw of mice exposed to CFA. BAPD was safe at the doses and time evaluated. BAPD exerts acute antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic actions, suggesting that it may represent an alternative in the future development of new therapeutic strategies."

When given chronically (twice a day) over 7 days, GL reversed the mechanical allodynia caused by partial sciatic nerve ligation (inhibition of 45% \u00b1 13% to 60% \u00b1 8%). Interestingly, GL did not affect the locomotor activity of mice in an open field test with doses that produce antinociceptive effects. Our findings show that GL inhibits acute and neuropathic pain in mice through mechanisms that involve the inhibition of ionotropic glutamate receptors and the interleukin -1\u03b2 pathway. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the antinociceptive activity of GL in acute and neuropathic pain with participation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2). After further experiments, this compound may represent a new pharmacological agent for the treatment of clinical pain."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The infusion or decoction of Mirabilis jalapa leaves is used in traditional medicine in Brazil to treat inflammatory and painful diseases. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate whether the leaf ethyl acetate (Eta) fraction from Mirabilis jalapa exhibits antinociceptive effect in clinically relevant pain models in mice. Furthermore, we have investigated the role of cholinergic system in the antinociceptive action produced by Eta in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of Eta administered orally (10mg/kg, p.o.) in mice was verified on the painful hypersensitivity (mechanical allodynia) in models of chronic inflammation (subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's Adjuvant-CFA in the plantar surface of the right hind paw), postoperative (paw surgical incision) and neuropathic (partial sciatic nerve ligation) pain. In the chronic inflammation model, we further verified the effect of Eta treatment on paw edema and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels. We also investigated the role of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the antiallodynic action produced by Eta as well as the possible action of Eta on in vitro and ex vivo acetylcholinesterase activity in CFA treated animals. Furthermore, we verified the effect of Eta treatment on the parameters of liver and kidney lesion (level of urea, and activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). RESULTS: Eta produced marked reduction in the allodynia caused by CFA, surgical incision and partial sciatic nerve ligation. However, Eta did not alter the paw edema or the increase of IL-1\u03b2 levels produced by CFA. The antinociceptive effect of Eta was reversed by the pre-treatment of animals with the antagonists of muscarinic (atropine, 5mg/kg, s.c) or nicotinic (mecamylamine, 0.001mg/kg, s.c.) receptors. Eta did not alter in vitro acetylcholinesterase activity in blood or spinal cord samples, but it reversed the increase in the acetylcholinesterase activity observed in the spinal cord samples from mice injected with CFA. Moreover, Eta did not alter the indicators of liver or kidney lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Based on its use in traditional medicine, the results of the present study confirmed the antinociceptive properties of Eta in clinically relevant pain models. Also its effect on the CFA-induced chronic inflammation seems to be related to acetylcholinesterase inhibition and cholinergic system."

In vitro, our study showed that Ilexgenin A inhibited the proliferation of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and this effect could be ascribed to the arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1. In vivo, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of Ilexgenin A in a tumor-bearing mouse model. The results showed that Ilexgenin A reduced the tumor weight by 51.13% (p<0.01). The Ilexgenin A treatment groups showed no apparent side effects during the treatment period. In addition, a histological analysis revealed that Ilexgenin A changed the cell morphology, and induced large areas of necrosis that correlated with a reduction in tumor size. The detection of inflammatory cytokines indicated that the IL-6 level decreased (p<0.001) and the TNF-\u03b1 level increased (p<0.01) in mice treated with Ilexgenin A. Ilexgenin A also inhibited the IL-6 production of macrophages stimulated by melanoma conditioned medium (MCM) significantly (p<0.001). Importantly, Ilexgenin A dramatically prolonged survival time (p<0.001). In conclusion, Ilexgenin A could be regarded as a promising agent for the treatment of melanoma; it exerts anti-melanoma activity by arresting the cell cycle at G0/G1 and regulating IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 production.

                "abstract": "AIMS: Breast cancer-induced chronic pain is usually treated with opioids, but these compounds cause various adverse effects. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is involved in cancer pain; also, endogenous TRPA1 agonists are associated with cancer pain development. The aim of this study was to observe the antinociceptive effect of a repeated-dose TRPA1 antagonist administration and the production of endogenous TRPA1 agonists and TRPA1 expression in bone tissue in a model of breast cancer pain in mice. Second, we used a sequence reading archive (SRA) strategy to observe the presence of this channel in the mouse bone and in mouse bone cell lines. MAIN METHODS: We used BALB/c mice for experiments. The animals were subjected to the tumor cell inoculation (4\u00a0T1 strain). HC-030031 (a TRPA1 antagonist) treatment was done from day 11 to day 20 after tumor inoculation. TRPA1 expression and biochemical tests of oxidative stress were performed in the bone of mice (femur). SRA strategy was used to detect the TRPA1 presence. KEY FINDINGS: Repeated treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist produced an antinociceptive effect. There was an increase in hydrogen peroxide levels, NADPH oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, but the expression of TRPA1 in the bone tissue was not altered. SRA did not show TRPA1 residual transcription in the osteoblast and osteoclast cell lines, as well as for mice cranial tissue and in mouse osteoclast precursors. SIGNIFICANCE: The TRPA1 receptor is a potential target for the development of new painkillers for the treatment of bone cancer pain."

In this study, we investigated the analgesic and adverse effects of peptide 3-5 (Tx3-5), purified from P. nigriventer venom, in several mouse models of pain. Tx3-5 was administered by intrathecal injection to mice selected as models of postoperative (plantar incision), neuropathic (partial sciatic nerve ligation) and cancer-related pain (inoculation with melanoma cells) in animals that were either sensitive or tolerant to morphine. Intrathecal administration of Tx3-5 (3-300\u00a0fmol/site) in mice could either prevent or reverse postoperative nociception, with a 50\u00a0% inhibitory dose (ID50) of 16.6 (3.2-87.2)\u2009fmol/site and a maximum inhibition of 87\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0% at a dose of 30\u00a0fmol/site. Its effect was prevented by the selective activator of L-type calcium channel Bay-K8644 (10\u00a0\u03bcg/site). Tx3-5 (30\u00a0fmol/site) also produced a partial antinociceptive effect in a neuropathic pain model (inhibition of 67\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0%). Additionally, treatment with Tx3-5 (30\u00a0fmol/site) nearly abolished cancer-related nociception with similar efficacy in both morphine-sensitive and morphine-tolerant mice (96\u2009\u00b1\u20097 and 100\u00a0% inhibition, respectively). Notably, Tx3-5 did not produce visible adverse effects at doses that produced antinociception and presented a TD50 of 1125 (893-1418)\u2009fmol/site. Finally, Tx3-5 did not alter the normal mechanical or thermal sensitivity of the animals or cause immunogenicity. Our results suggest that Tx3-5 is a strong drug candidate for the treatment of painful conditions."

It is used for the treatment of Chagas disease and as antirheumatic in folk medicine. This study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive activity of the aqueous extract (AERi) of Rourea induta leaves in rodents, as well as isolate and identify components that can be responsible for its effect. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antinociceptive effect of orally administered AERi was evaluated in behavioral models of acute (formalin) and chronic [complete Freund\u05f3s adjuvant (CFA)] pain in mice. We also investigated the possible involvement of opioid receptors and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) in the antinociceptive effect of the AERi. In addition, a nonspecific effect of AERi was evaluated by measuring locomotor activity and corporal temperature. Finally, we performed a phytochemical analysis of AERi. RESULTS: HPLC titration revealed the presence of hyperin (21.6 mg/g), quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-xyloside (4.4 mg/g), quercetin-3-O-\u03b1-arabinofuranoside (12.0 mg/g), and quercetin (2.1 mg/g). It was also possible to isolate minor constituents\u05f3 chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid and procyanidin C1. The oral administration of AERi (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the neurogenic (37 \u00b1 5%) and inflammatory (34 \u00b1 7%) phases of formalin-induced pain. Acute and repeated treatment of animals with AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) once a day markedly reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity response induced by CFA, and this effect was evident until the day 10. Moreover, repeated treatment with AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the paw (22 \u00b1 7% and 50 \u00b1 19%) and in the spinal cord (100% and 100%) when compared to the CFA group. The AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) markedly reduced biting behavior induced by intrathecal injection of TNF-\u03b1 (81 \u00b1 11%). Finally, the effect of AERi was not associated with changes in locomotor activity or the corporal temperature of animals. CONCLUSION: These data show that aqueous extract of Rourea induta has significant antinociceptive action, which seems to be associated with an inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines activated pathways. These findings support the ethnomedical uses of this plant."

            "abstract": "Cachexia, a devastating wasting syndrome characterized by severe weight loss with specific losses of muscle and adipose tissue, is driven by reduced food intake, increased energy expenditure, excess catabolism, and inflammation. Cachexia is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality and frequently occurs in patients with cancer, chronic kidney disease, infection, and many other illnesses. There is no effective treatment for this condition. Hypothalamic melanocortins have a potent and long-lasting inhibitory effect on feeding and anabolism, and pathophysiological processes increase melanocortin signaling tone, leading to anorexia, metabolic changes, and eventual cachexia. We used 3 rat models of anorexia and cachexia (LPS, methylcholanthrene sarcoma, and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy) to evaluate efficacy of TCMCB07, a synthetic antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor. Our data show that peripheral treatment using TCMCB07 with intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and oral administration increased food intake and body weight and preserved fat mass and lean mass during cachexia and LPS-induced anorexia. Furthermore, administration of TCMCB07 diminished hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression in cancer cachexia. These results suggest that peripheral TCMCB07 treatment effectively inhibits central melanocortin signaling and therefore stimulates appetite and enhances anabolism, indicating that TCMCB07 is a promising drug candidate for treating cachexia."

                "abstract": "Cachexia is a process that accompanies many chronic diseases, and consists of a combination of wasting of lean body mass, increased energy expenditure, and a paradoxical loss of appetite. Cachexia both worsens quality of life and negatively affects treatment of the underlying disease. Conditions as diverse as cancer, renal failure, and heart failure show a remarkable similarity in their associated cachexia, exhibiting changes in metabolism and endocrinology, including marked increases in levels of cytokines that accompany these diseases. So far, it has been difficult to treat disease-associated cachexia successfully. One treatment that has shown promise in animal trials, however, involves antagonism of the central melanocortin system, an anorexigenic pathway in the hypothalamus and brainstem. Humans who have genetic mutations involving pro-opiomelanocortin or the melanocortin 4 receptor in this pathway exhibit increased appetite and increased lean body mass. Recent research has shown that in rodent models of cancer and renal failure, administration of melanocortin 4 receptor antagonists results in an attenuation of symptoms of cachexia, including maintenance of appetite, lean body mass, and basal energy expenditure. Although this research needs to be substantiated in humans, it provides a promising direction for treating the wasting that is associated with a variety of disease states."

                "abstract": "Individuals affected with either acute or chronic diseases often show disorders of nutrient balance. In some cases, a devastating state of malnutrition known as cachexia arises, brought about by a synergistic combination of a dramatic decrease in appetite and an increase in metabolism of fat and lean body mass. Stimulation of the hypothalamic melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4-R) produces relative anorexia and increased metabolic rate, even in a relatively starved state. Here we demonstrate that cachexia induced by lipopolysaccharide administration and by tumor growth is ameliorated by central MC4-R blockade. MC4-R knock-out mice or mice administered the MC3-R/MC4-R antagonist, agouti-related peptide, resist tumor-induced loss of lean body mass, and maintain normal circadian activity patterns during tumor growth. The final tumor mass is not affected in these animals, providing further support for the potential role of MC4-R antagonism in the treatment of cachexia in disease states."

                "abstract": "Aberrant melanocortin signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of wasting in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previously, we demonstrated that agouti-related peptide (AgRP), a melenocortin-4 receptor antagonist, reduced CKD-associated cachexia in CKD mice. Our previous studies with AgRP utilized dual energy X-ray (DXA) densitometry to assess the body composition in mice (Cheung W, Kuo HJ, Markison S, Chen C, Foster AC, Marks DL, Mak RH. J Am Soc Nephrol 18: 2517-2524, 2007; Cheung W, Yu PX, Little BM, Cone RD, Marks DL, Mak RH. J Clin Invest 115: 1659-1665, 2005). DXA is unable to differentiate water content in mice, and fluid retention in CKD may lead to an overestimate of lean mass. In this study, we employed quantitative magnetic resonance technique to evaluate body composition change following central administration of AgRP in a CKD mouse model. AgRP treatment improved energy expenditure, total body mass, fat mass, and lean body mass in CKD mouse. We also investigated the effect of CKD-associated cachexia on the signaling pathways leading to wasting in skeletal muscle, as well as whether these changes can be ameliorated by central administration of AgRP. AgRP treatment caused an overall decrease in proinflammatory cytokines, which may be one important mechanism of its effects. Muscle wasting in CKD may be due to the activation of proteolytic pathways as well as inhibition of myogenesis and muscle regeneration processes. Our results suggest that these aberrant pathological pathways leading to muscle wasting in CKD mice were ameliorated by central administration of AgRP."

                "abstract": "Animals and humans respond to starvation with a complex neuroendocrine response that ultimately leads to an increase in appetite, a sparing of lean body mass (LBM) and burning of fat, and an overall decrease in basal metabolic rate. In contrast, cachexia is a pathological state of malnutrition associated with many infections and chronic diseases, wherein appetite is diminished concomitant with an increase in metabolic rate, and a relative wasting of LBM. In previous studies, we demonstrated that anorexia and weight loss in mouse cachexia models induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration and by tumor growth are ameliorated by central melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptor (MC4-R) blockade. In contrast to the results seen with MC4 blockade, melanocortin-3 (MC3) receptor knockout (MC3-RKO) mice show illness-induced anorexia and weight loss with LPS administration and with cytokine administration, and they have similar decreases in mobility. Both MC3-RKOs and MC4-RKOs have an intact corticosterone response and fever with LPS injection. In tumor models, we show that MC4-RKO mice resist the loss of LBM brought about by tumor growth, whereas MC3-RKO animals show enhanced tissue wasting. These data underscore the importance of central melanocortin signaling in weight homeostasis and demonstrate differential effects of MC3-R and MC4-R blockade on the development of cachexia."

                "abstract": "The melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptor subtype plays a pivotal role in body weight regulation. Knock-out or mutation of MC4 receptors in animals or humans leads to severe obesity and acute or sub-acute antagonism of central MC4 receptors produces an increase in food intake and a decrease in metabolism. Knock-out or antagonism of MC4 receptors in animal models of cachexia leads to a protection from anorexia and the loss of both lean and fat body mass, suggesting that an MC4 antagonist may be beneficial in wasting diseases, which are poorly treated by available therapies. Considerable progress has been made in the discovery of non-peptide antagonists with high affinity and selectivity for MC4 receptors. Optimization of these compounds has produced molecules that are active upon systemic administration and are effective in protecting against cachectic symptoms in animal models of tumor-induced wasting. Further development of such compounds is greatly anticipated as a potential means to combat the cachexia that results from chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS, renal failure, liver failure, congestive heart failure and lung disease."

Recent experiments show that blockade of melanocortin signaling using antagonists to the melanocortin MC(4) receptor attenuates disease-associated anorexia and wasting in rodent models of cancer and renal failure.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cachexia is among the most debilitating and life-threatening aspects of cancer. It represents a metabolic syndrome affecting essential functional circuits involved in the regulation of homeostasis, and includes anorexia, fat and muscle tissue wasting. The anorexigenic peptide alpha-MSH is believed to be crucially involved in the normal and pathologic regulation of food intake. It was speculated that blockade of its central physiological target, the melanocortin (MC)-4 receptor, might provide a promising anti-cachexia treatment strategy. This idea is supported by the fact that in animal studies, agouti-related protein (AgRP), the endogenous inverse agonist at the MC-4 receptor, was found to affect two hallmark features of cachexia, i.e. to increase food intake and to reduce energy expenditure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SNT207707 and SNT209858 are two recently discovered, non peptidic, chemically unrelated, orally active MC-4 receptor antagonists penetrating the blood brain barrier. Both compounds were found to distinctly increase food intake in healthy mice. Moreover, in mice subcutaneously implanted with C26 adenocarcinoma cells, repeated oral administration (starting the day after tumor implantation) of each of the two compounds almost completely prevented tumor induced weight loss, and diminished loss of lean body mass and fat mass. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to the previously reported peptidic and small molecule MC-4 antagonists, the compounds described here work by the oral administration route. Orally active compounds might offer a considerable advantage for the treatment of cachexia patients."

It is a relatively common disorder, and is a pathological feature of diseases such as cancer, HIV infection, and renal failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that cachexia brought about by a variety of illnesses can be attenuated or reversed by blocking activation of the melanocortin 4 subtype receptor (MC4-R) within the central nervous system. Although the potential use of central MC4-R antagonists for the treatment of cachexia was supported by these studies, utility was limited by the need to deliver these agents intracerebroventricularly. In the current study, we present a series of experiments demonstrating that peripheral administration of a small molecule MC4-R antagonist can effectively stimulate daytime (satiated) food intake as well as decrease basal metabolic rate in normal animals. Furthermore, this compound attenuated cachexia and preserved lean body mass in a murine cancer model. These data clearly demonstrate the potential of small molecule MC4-R antagonists in the treatment of cachexia and underscore the importance of melanocortin signaling in the development of this metabolic disorder."

                "abstract": "Cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that occurs in multiple disease states, and is associated with anorexia and a progressive loss of body fat and lean mass. The development of new therapeutics for this disorder is needed due to poor efficacy and multiple side effects of current therapies. The pivotal role played by the central melanocortin system in regulating body weight has made this an attractive target for novel cachexia therapies. The mixed melanocortin receptor antagonist AgRP is an endogenous peptide that induces hyperphagia. Here, we used AgRP(83-132) to investigate the ability of melanocortin antagonism to protect against clinical features of cachexia in two distinct animal models. In an acute model, food intake and body weight gain were reduced in mice exposed to radiation (300 RAD), and delivery of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral cerebral ventricle prevented these effects. In a chronic tumor cachexia model, adult mice were injected subcutaneously with a cell line derived from murine colon-26 adenocarcinoma. Typical of cachexia, tumor-bearing mice progressively reduced body weight and food intake, and gained significantly less muscle mass than controls. Administration of AgRP(83-132) into the lateral ventricles significantly increased body weight and food intake, and changes in muscle mass were similar to the tumor-free control mice. These findings support the idea that antagonism of the central melanocortin system can reduce the negative impact of cachexia and radiation therapy."

Pharmacologic blockade of this system using melanocortin antagonists causes attenuation of the signs of cachexia in laboratory models. Recent advances in our knowledge of this disease process have involved further elucidation of the pathophysiology of melanocortin activation and demonstration of the efficacy of melanocortin antagonists in new models of cachexia, including cardiac cachexia. In addition, small molecule antagonists of the melanocortin-4 receptor continue to be introduced, including ones with oral bioavailability. These developments generate optimism that melanocortin antagonism will be used to treat humans with disease-associated cachexia. However, to date, human application has remained elusive and it is unclear when we will know whether humans with cachexia would benefit from treatment with these compounds."

                "abstract": "We have recently shown that genetic or pharmacological blockade of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) attenuates uremia-associated cachexia. However, the potential clinical utility of this approach has been limited by the need to deliver a peptide MC4-R antagonist into the ventricles of the brain. NBI-12i is a recently developed small molecule MC4-R antagonist, with high affinity and selectivity that penetrates the central nervous system after peripheral administration. We tested whether NBI-12i would also be effective in attenuating uremia-associated cachexia in a mouse model. Intraperitoneal administration of NBI-12i stimulated food intake and weight gain in uremic mice. Furthermore, NBI-12i-treated uremic mice gained lean body mass, fat mass, and had a lower basal metabolic rate compared to vehicle-treated and diet-supplemented uremic mice, which lost both lean body mass and fat mass and had an increase in basal metabolic rate. We found that NBI-12i normalizes the expression of uncoupling protein, which is normally upregulated in uremic mice, and we speculate that this may contribute to the drug's protective effect. These data underscore the importance of melanocortin signaling in the pathogenesis of uremia-associated cachexia and demonstrate the potential of peripheral administration of MC4-R antagonists as a novel therapeutic approach."

                "abstract": "Cachexia is a condition typified by wasting of fat and LBM caused by anorexia and further endocrinological modulation of energy stores. Diseases known to cause cachectic symptoms include cancer, chronic kidney disease, and chronic heart failure; these conditions are associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased resting energy expenditure. Early studies have suggested the central melanocortin system as one of the main mediators of the symptoms of cachexia. Pharmacological and genetic antagonism of these pathways attenuates cachectic symptoms in laboratory models; effects have yet to be studied in humans. In addition, ghrelin, an endogenous orexigenic hormone with receptors on melanocortinergic neurons, has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of cachexia, at least in part, by an increase in appetite via melanocortin modulation, in addition to its anticatabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. These effects of ghrelin have been confirmed in multiple types of cachexia in both laboratory and human studies, suggesting a positive future for cachexia treatments."

                "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that acts as a major regulator of food intake and energy homeostasis. It circulates both as a free and as a protein-bound entity. Leptin is released into the blood in proportion to the amount of body fat and exerts sustained inhibitory effects on food intake while increasing energy expenditure. The leptin receptor belongs to the class I cytokine receptor superfamily and possesses strong homology to the signal-transducing subunits of the IL-6 receptor. The hypothalamic melanocortin system, and specifically the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC-4R), is critical in mediating leptin's effect on appetite and metabolism. Serum leptin concentrations are elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and correlate with C-reactive protein levels suggesting that inflammation is an important factor that contributes to hyperleptinemia in CKD. Hyperleptinemia may be important in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated cachexia in CKD. We showed that experimental uremic cachexia was attenuated in db/db mice, a model of leptin receptor deficiency. Nephrectomy in these animals did not result in any change in weight gain, body composition, resting metabolic rate, and efficiency of food consumption. Furthermore, experimental uremic cachexia could be ameliorated by blocking leptin signaling through the hypothalamic MC-4R. MC-4R knockout mice or mice administered the MC-4R and MC-3R antagonist, agouti-related peptide, resisted uremia-induced loss of lean body mass and maintained normal basal metabolic rates. Thus, melanocortin receptor antagonism may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammation-associated cachexia in CKD."

This study aimed to clarify the gut-brain peptides involved in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and determine effective treatment for cancer anorexia-cachexia. We show that both ghrelin insufficiency and resistance were observed in tumor-bearing rats. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) decreased the plasma level of acyl ghrelin, and its receptor antagonist, \u03b1-helical CRF, increased food intake of these rats. The serotonin 2c receptor (5-HT2cR) antagonist SB242084 decreased hypothalamic CRF level and improved anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility and body weight loss. The ghrelin receptor antagonist (D-Lys3)-GHRP-6 worsened anorexia and hastened death in tumor-bearing rats. Ghrelin attenuated anorexia-cachexia in the short term, but failed to prolong survival, as did SB242084 administration. In addition, the herbal medicine rikkunshito improved anorexia, GI dysmotility, muscle wasting, and anxiety-related behavior and prolonged survival in animals and patients with cancer. The appetite-stimulating effect of rikkunshito was blocked by (D-Lys3)-GHRP-6. Active components of rikkunshito, hesperidin and atractylodin, potentiated ghrelin secretion and receptor signaling, respectively, and atractylodin prolonged survival in tumor-bearing rats. Our study demonstrates that the integrated mechanism underlying cancer anorexia-cachexia involves lowered ghrelin signaling due to excessive hypothalamic interactions of 5-HT with CRF through the 5-HT2cR. Potentiation of ghrelin receptor signaling may be an attractive treatment for anorexia, muscle wasting and prolong survival in patients with cancer anorexia-cachexia."

However, it remains unknown if this molecule influences appetite during cancer cachexia, a devastating clinical entity characterized by decreased nutrition and progressive wasting. We demonstrate that LCN2 is robustly upregulated in murine models of pancreatic cancer, its expression is associated with reduced food consumption, and Lcn2 deletion is protective from cachexia-anorexia. Consistent with LCN2's proposed MC4R-dependent role in cancer-induced anorexia, pharmacologic MC4R antagonism mitigates cachexia-anorexia, while restoration of Lcn2 expression in the bone marrow is sufficient in restoring the anorexia feature of cachexia. Finally, we observe that LCN2 levels correlate with fat and lean mass wasting and is associated with increased mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these findings implicate LCN2 as a pathologic mediator of appetite suppression during pancreatic cancer cachexia."

Ghrelin analogs are a possible treatment against cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS). This study aimed to investigate whether oral treatment with the non-peptidergic ghrelin receptor agonist HM01 counteracts CACS in colon-26 (C26) tumor-bearing mice. The C26 tumor model is characterized by pronounced body weight (BW) loss and muscle wasting in the absence of severe anorexia. We analyzed the time course of BW loss, body composition, muscle mass, bone mineral density, and the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage-inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1). Moreover, we measured the expression of the muscle degradation markers muscle RING-finger-protein-1 (MuRF-1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx). After tumor inoculation, MIC-1 levels increased earlier than IL-6 and both cytokines were elevated before MuRF-1/MAFbx expression increased. Oral HM01 treatment increased BW, fat mass, and neuronal hypothalamic activity in healthy mice. In tumor-bearing mice, HM01 increased food intake, BW, fat mass, muscle mass, and bone mineral density while it decreased energy expenditure. These effects appeared to be independent of IL-6, MIC-1, MuRF-1 or MAFbx, which were not affected by HM01. Therefore, HM01 counteracts cachectic body weight loss under inflammatory conditions and is a promising compound for the treatment of cancer cachexia in the absence of severe anorexia."

We tested the hypothesis that uremia-associated cachexia is caused by leptin signaling through the hypothalamic melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4-R). We performed either subtotal nephrectomy (N) or sham operations in WT, leptin receptor-deficient (db/db), and MC4-R knockout (MC4-RKO) mice. The animals were on 17% protein diets, and none of the uremic animals were acidotic. WT-N mice produced a classic syndrome of cachexia characterized by decreased food intake, increased metabolic rate, and loss of lean body mass. Corrected leptin levels were elevated. db/db mice and MC4-RKO mice resisted the cachexic effects of uremia on weight gain, body composition, and metabolic rate. Likewise, treatment of WT mice with intracranial agouti-related peptide reversed the cachexic effects of uremia on appetite, weight gain, body composition, and metabolic rate. Gene expression of ubiquitin C and proteasome subunits C2, C3, and C9 was not changed in the uremic animals, suggesting that other pathways are involved in this model of nonacidotic uremic cachexia. The results of this study suggest that elevated circulating levels of cytokines such as leptin may be an important cause of uremia-associated cachexia via signaling through the central melanocortin system."

            "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a well-known devastating lesion that sadly is very resistant to all treatment attempts. This fact has stimulated the exploration of multiple regenerative strategies that are examined at both the basic and clinical level. For laboratory research, differentin vivomodels are used, but each has many important limitations. The main limitation of these models is the high level of animal suffering related to the inflicted neurologic injury. It has caused a growing tendency to limit the injury, but this, in turn, produces incomplete SCI models and uncertainties in the neuroregeneration interpretation. To overcome such limitations, a new experimental SCI model is proposed. Geckos have been extensively examined as a potential animal model of SCI. Their spinal cord extends into the tail and can be transected without causing the typical neurologic consequences observed in rat models. In this study, we compared the gecko tail SCI model with the rat model of thoracic SCI. Anatomic and histologic analyses showed comparability between the gecko and rat in diameter of spinal canal and spinal cord, as well as applicability of multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin, immunostaining, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy). We tested the suitability ofin vivostudy with 3 prototype implants for the reconstruction of SCI: a multichannel sponge, a multilaminar tube, and a gel cylinder. These were compared with a spinal cord excision (control). A 20-wk observation revealed no adverse effects of SCI on the animals' well-being. The animals were easily housed and observed. Histologic analysis showed growth of nervous tissue elements on implant surface and implant cellular colonization. The study showed that the gecko SCI model can be used as a primary model for the assessment of SCI treatment methods. It provides a platform for testing multiple solutions with limited animal suffering before performing tests on mammals. Detailed results of the experimental conditions and testing techniques are provided.-Szarek, D., Marycz, K., Lis, A., Zawada, Z., Tabakow, P., Laska, J., Jarmundowicz, W.

                "abstract": "Cervical contusive trauma accounts for the majority, of human spinal cord injury (SCI), yet experimental use of cervical contusion injury models has been limited. Considering that (1) the different ways of injuring the spinal cord (compression, contusion, and transection) induce very different processes of tissue damage and (2) the architecture of the spinal cord is not uniform, it is important to use a model that is more clinically applicable to human SCI. Therefore, in the current study we have developed a rat model of contusive, cervical SCI using the Electromagnetic Spinal Cord Injury Device (ESCID) developed at Ohio State University (OSU) to induce injury by spinal cord displacement. We used the device to perform mild, moderate and severe injuries (0.80, 0.95, and 1.1 mm displacements, respectively) with a single, brief displacement of <20 msec upon the exposed dorsal surface of the C5 cervical spinal cord of female (180-200 g) Fischer rats. Characterization of the model involved the analysis of the temporal histopathological progression of the injury over 9 weeks using histochemical stains to analyze white and gray mater integrity and immunohistochemistry to examine cellular changes and physiological responses within the injured spinal cord. Accompanying the histological analysis was a comprehensive determination of the behavioral functionality of the animals using a battery of motor tests. Characterization of this novel model is presented to enable and encourage its future use in the design and experimental testing of therapeutic strategies that may be used for human SCI."

                "abstract": "Animal models are widely used for studying the pathophysiology as well as treatment strategies for injuries of the central nervous system. However, it is still unclear in how far the rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) is valid for human SCI. Therefore, comparisons were made among functional, electrophysiological, and morphological outcome parameters following SCI in rats and humans. Contusion of the mid-thoracic spinal cord in 27 adult rats was induced by a weight-drop, leading to severe deficits in open field locomotion at a chronic stage. The data of 85 human patients with chronic SCI were collected and compared with the rat data. In electrophysiological recordings, prolonged latencies and reduced amplitudes in both motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were closely correlated to the impairment of locomotor capacity of lower limbs in rats and humans. The morphological parameters assessed by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in both species indicated that the lesion length and spinal cord atrophy were significantly related to the electrophysiological and functional outcome parameters. In rats, histological analysis was performed and showed, in addition to the MRI, a close relationship between spared white matter and locomotor capacity. Our results suggest an analogous relationship in rats and humans with respect to functional, electrophysiological, and morphological outcomes. Thus, the techniques for evaluating the extent and severity of SCI in humans and rats are of comparable value. This indicates that the rat can serve as an adequate animal model for research on functional and morphological changes after SCI and the effects of new treatment strategies."

                "abstract": "OBJECT: Neuroprotective and repair strategies in spinal cord injuries (SCIs) have been so far largely unsuccessful. One of the prerequisites is the use of appropriate preclinical models to decipher pathophysiological mechanisms; another is the identification of optimal time windows for therapeutic interventions. The authors undertook this study to characterize early motor, sensory, autonomic, and histological outcomes after balloon compression of the spinal cord at the T8-9 level in adult rats. METHODS: A total of 91 rats were used in this study. Spinal cord balloon compression was performed at T8-9 in adult rats by inflation of a 2 Fr Fogarty catheter into the epidural space. The authors first characterized early motor, sensory, and autonomic outcomes of 2 volumes of compression (10 and 15 microl) using behavioral tests and then examined histological outcomes in the spinal cord using Luxol fast blue staining. To further substantiate the characterization of the epidural balloon-compression model, they used a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, GK11, and demonstrated the involvement of excitotoxicity in this model. RESULTS: Proportional and reproducible functional impairment resulted from compression caused by balloon inflation with either 10 or 15 microl of water and corresponded to the extent of the lesion. Indeed, during the early phase following SCI (1 week postinjury), recovery of locomotor function and bladder control correlated with the volume of inflation, whereas outcomes with respect to sensory function and reflexes were independent of compression severity. Treatment with GK11 significantly improved motor function in all groups of rats 1 week after injury and bladder voiding in the 10-microl injured rats compared to the 15-microl injured rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that spinal balloon-compression injury in the rat is a well-characterized, reproducible, and predictable model to analyze early events following SCI."

They represent a powerful tool for the development of therapeutic strategies in the fields of pharmacological, cellular, and genetic approaches of neurotrauma. We demonstrate here that the photochemical graded ischemic spinal cord injury model, described in rats, can be successfully adapted in mice, in a reliable and reproducible manner. Following the intravenous injection of Rose Bengal, the translucent dorsal surface of the T9 vertebral laminae of C57BL/6 female mice was irradiated with a 560-nm wavelength-light (3-8 min depending on the experimental group). Animals were sacrificed at 1 day or 7 days after injury. Functional tests were performed daily for motor, sensory, autonomic, and reflex responses. Lesion histopathology was assessed for lesion length, percentage of residual white matter, and astrocytic reactivity. Experimental groups demonstrated a functional deficit, which was correlated to the increase of the irradiation time and, therefore, to the severity of the injury. Histopathological and immunocytochemical data were reliable morphological measurements characterizing the degree of injury, which were strongly correlated to the severity of the functional impairment. Despite differences in the mechanism of injury, the wound healing response described in other traumatic SCI mice models was confirmed (no cavitation and, conversely, the formation of a dense connective tissue matrix). In this context, the precise understanding of the mechanisms of healing response after SCI in mice and of neurochemical kinetics appear to be crucial in the development of therapeutic strategies of CNS repair. Thus, the possible use of an increasing collection of transgenic mice offers a new dimension for experimental research in this area. The ischemic photochemical model of SCI in mice represents a relevant model that can play a key role in this new era of neurotrauma research."

Animal models provide a good opportunity to test therapeutic strategies in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to laminectomy at T9 and compression with a vascular clip (30g force, 1min). Two groups were analyzed: injured group (SCI, n=33) and laminectomy only (Sham, n=15). Locomotor behavior (Basso mouse scale-BMS and global mobility) was assessed weekly. Morphological analyses were performed by LM and EM. The Sham group did not show any morphofunctional alteration. All SCI animals showed flaccid paralysis 24h after injury, with subsequent improvement. The BMS score of the SCI group improved until the intermediate phase (2.037+/-1.198); the Sham animals maintained the highest BMS score (8.981+/-0.056), p<0.001 during the entire time. The locomotor speed was slower in the SCI animals (5.581+/-0.871) than in the Sham animals (15.80+/-1.166), p<0.001. Morphological analysis of the SCI group showed, in the acute phase, edema, hemorrhage, multiple cavities, fiber degeneration, cell death and demyelination. In the chronic phase we observed glial scarring, neuron death, and remyelination of spared axons by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. In conclusion, we established a simple, reliable, and inexpensive clip compression model in mice, with functional and morphological reproducibility and good validity. The availability of producing reliable injuries with appropriate outcome measures represents great potential for studies involving cellular mechanisms of primary injury and repair after traumatic SCI."

                "abstract": "Most experimental studies of spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats damage the thoracic cord, with the consequent functional loss being due to interruption of long tracts connecting the caudal spinal cord to the rostral nervous system. Less work has been done evaluating injury to the cervical cord, even though it is the most common level of human SCI. In addition to the long tracts, the cervical spinal cord contains the sensory and motor neurons responsible for upper extremity function. The purpose of this study was to further develop a rat model of cervical spinal cord contusion injury using a modified NYU/MASCIS weight drop device. Mild (6.25 mm) and moderate (12.5 mm) C5 unilateral injuries were produced. Behavioral recovery was examined using a grooming test, a paw preference test, a walkway test (The Catwalk), and a horizontal ladder test. Histological outcome measures included sparing at the lesion epicenter, sparing throughout the extent of the lesion, quantification of myelin loss rostral and caudal to the lesion, and motor neuron counts. Compared to controls, animals receiving SCI exhibited injury severity-specific deficits in forelimb, locomotor, and hindlimb function persisting for 6-weeks post-SCI. Histological analysis revealed ipsilateral containment of the injury, and differentiation between groups on all measures except motor neuron counts. This model has many advantages: (1) minimal animal care requirements post-SCI, (2) within subject controls, (3) functional loss involves primarily the ipsilateral forelimb, and (4) it is a behavioral and histological model for both gray and white matter damage caused by contusive SCI."

                "abstract": "A three-dimensional (3D) finite element model (FEM) that simulates the Impactor weight-drop experimental model of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) was developed. The model consists of the rat spinal cord, with distinct element sets for the gray and white matter, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the dura mater, a rigid rat spinal column, and a rigid impactor. Loading conditions were taken from the average impact velocities determined from previous parallel weight-drop experiments employing a 2.5-mm-diameter, 10-g rod dropped from either 12.5 or 25 mm. The mechanical properties were calibrated by comparing the predicted displacement of the spinal cord at the impact site to that measured experimentally. Parametric studies were performed to determine the sensitivity of the model to the relevant material properties, loading conditions, and essential boundary conditions, and it was determined that the shear modulus had the greatest influence on spinal cord displacement. Additional simulations were performed where gray and white matter were prescribed different material properties. These simulations generated similar drop trajectories to the homogeneous model, but the stress and strain distributions better matched patterns of acute albumin extravasation across the blood-spinal cord barrier following weight-drop SCI, as judged by a logit analysis. A final simulation was performed where the impact site was shifted laterally by 0.35 mm. The off-center impact had little effect on the rod trajectory, but caused marked shifts in the location of stress and strain contours. Different combinations of parameter values could reproduce the impactor trajectory, which suggests that another experimental measure of the tissue response is required for validation. The FEM can be a valuable tool for understanding the injury biomechanics associated with experimental SCI to identify areas for improvement in animal models and future research to identify thresholds for injury."

We have, therefore, investigated whether methods used to produce and evaluate graded experimental contusive SCI in the rat could be modified to produce a mouse model of traumatic SCI. C57BL6 mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and a restricted laminectomy performed at the T8 vertebral level. The spinal column was stabilized and a weight drop technique used to produce contusive injury. Experimental groups were distinguished by the amount of weight or the height from which the weight was dropped onto an impounder resting on the dura (1 g x 2.5 cm, 2 g x 2.5 cm, 3 g x 2.5 cm, and 3 g x 5.0 cm). Functional deficits over time were examined up to 28 days after SCI by testing hindlimb reflex responses and coordinated motor function. Chronic lesion histopathology was evaluated by light microscopy and analyzed with morphometric techniques. All groups demonstrated profound functional deficits after injury followed by gradual recovery. Recovery correlated with the weight dropped and percent of white matter spared that was 41.3+/-6.0% (mean +/- SEM) in the 2 g x 2.5 cm group and 24.3+/-5.0% in the 3 g x 2.5 cm group. A replicate experiment confirmed reproducibility of the injury. This new mouse model of contusive SCI could pave the way for in vivo studies of the effect of genetic modifications produced by specific mutations on injury and recovery processes after spinal cord trauma."

                "abstract": "OBJECT: A glial scar is thought to be responsible for halting neuroregeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). However, little quantitative evidence has been provided to show the relationship of a glial scar and axonal regrowth after injury. METHODS: In this study performed in rats and dogs, a traumatic SCI model was made using a weight-drop injury device, and tissue sections were stained with H & E for immunohistochemical analysis. The function and behavior of model animals were tested using electrophysiological recording and the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale, respectively. The cavity in the spinal cord after SCI in dogs was observed using MR imaging. RESULTS: The morphological results showed that the formation of an astroglial scar was defined at 4 weeks after SCI. While regenerative axons reached the vicinity of the lesion site, the glial scar blocked the extension of regrown axons. In agreement with these findings, the electrophysiological, behavioral, and in vivo MR imaging tests showed that functional recovery reached a plateau at 4 weeks after SCI. The thickness of the glial scars in the injured rat spinal cords was also measured. The mean thickness of the glial scar rostral and caudal to the lesion cavity was 107.00 +/- 20.12 microm; laterally it was 69.92 +/- 15.12 microm. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide comprehensive evidence indicating that the formation of a glial scar inhibits axonal regeneration at 4 weeks after SCI. This study reveals a critical time window of postinjury recovery and a detailed spatial orientation of glial scar, which would provide an important basis for the development of therapeutic strategy for glial scar ablation."

                "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disorder that has a poor prognosis of recovery. Animal models of SCI are useful to understand the pathophysiology of SCI and the potential use of therapeutic strategies for human SCI. Ex vivo models of central nervous system (CNS) trauma, particularly mechanical trauma, have become important tools to complement in\u00a0vivo models of injury in order to reproduce the sequelae of human CNS injury. Ex vivo organotypic slice cultures (OSCs) provide a reliable model platform for the study of cell dynamics and therapeutic intervention following SCI. In addition, these ex\u00a0vivo models support the 3R concept of animal use in SCI research -\u00a0replacement, reduction and refinement. Ex vivo models cannot be used to monitor functional recovery, nor do they have the intact blood supply of the in\u00a0vivo model systems. However, the ex\u00a0vivo models appear to reproduce many of the post traumatic events including acute and secondary injury mechanisms. Several well-established OSC models have been developed over the past few years for experimental spinal injuries ex\u00a0vivo in order to understand the biological response to injury. In this study, we investigated cell viability in three ex\u00a0vivo OSC models of SCI: stab injury, transection injury and contusion injury. Injury was inflicted in postnatal day 4 rat spinal cord slices. Stab injury was performed using a needle on transverse slices of spinal cord. Transection injury was performed on longitudinal slices of spinal cord using a double blade technique. Contusion injury was performed on longitudinal slices of spinal cord using an Infinite Horizon impactor device. At days 3 and 10 post-injury, viability was measured using dual staining for propidium iodide and fluorescein diacetate. In all ex\u00a0vivo SCI models, the slices showed more live cells than dead cells over 10\u00a0days in culture, with higher cell viability in control slices compared with injured slices. Although no change in cell viability was observed between time-points in stab- and contusion-injured OSCs, a reduction in cell viability was observed over time in transection-injured OSCs. Taken together, ex\u00a0vivo SCI models are a useful and reliable research tool that reduces the cost and time involved in carrying out animal studies. The use of OSC models provides a simple way to study the cellular consequences following SCI, and they can also be used to investigate potential therapeutics regimes for the treatment of SCI."

MEPs provide objective assessment of electrical conduction through the associated neural pathways, and therefore detect disruption due to a nervous system injury such as spinal cord injury (SCI). In our studies of SCI, we developed a novel, multi-channel set-up for MEP acquisition in rat models. Unlike existing electrophysiological systems for SCI assessment, the set-up allows for multi-channel MEP acquisition from all limbs of rats and enables longitudinal monitoring of injury and treatment for in vivo models of experimental SCI. The article describes the development of the set-up and discusses its capabilities to acquire MEPs in rat models of SCI. We demonstrate its use for MEP acquisition under two types of anesthesia as well as a range of cortical stimulation parameters, identifying parameters yielding consistent and reliable MEPs. To validate our set-up, MEPs were recorded from a group of 10 rats before and after contusive SCI. Upon contusion with moderate severity (12.5mm impact height), MEP amplitude decreased by 91.36\u00b16.03%. A corresponding decline of 93.8\u00b111.4% was seen in the motor behavioral score (BBB), a gold standard in rodent models of SCI."

Therefore, much effort has been focused on developing several methods to document the recovery of locomotor function after experimental SCI. Computerized rat gait analysis is becoming increasingly popular in the SCI research community. The two-dimensional (2D) kinematic approach is by far the most popular technique in rat gait analysis. This is a simple inexpensive procedure, which requires only one camera to record the movement. Our study included an examination of locomotion on a treadmill using 2D and three-dimensional (3D) analysis, in neurologically intact animals and following moderate T9 contusion injury. Despite the overall time course patterns of the curves were identical, we found significant differences between values of the 2D and 3D joint angular motion. In conclusion, maximal precision and accuracy of the kinematic values are expected when the experimental protocol includes a 3D motion analysis methodology. Moreover, a 2D method cannot be used to determine the external or internal rotations of the foot because this movement occurs in the transverse plane."

                "abstract": "The complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) increase in number and severity with the level of injury. A recent survey of SCI researchers reveals that animal models of high SCI are essential. Despite this consensus, most laboratories continue to work with mid- or low-thoracic SCI. The available data on cervical SCI in animals characterize incomplete injuries; for example, nearly all studies published in 2009 examine discrete, tract-specific lesions that are not clinically-relevant. A primary barrier to developing animal models of severe, higher SCI is the challenge of animal care, a critical determinant of experimental outcome. Currently, many of these practices vary substantially between laboratories, and are passed down anecdotally within institutions. The care of animals with SCI is complex, and becomes much more challenging as the lesion level ascends. In our experience, the care of animals with high-thoracic (T3) SCI is much more demanding than the care of animals with low-thoracic SCI, even though both injuries result in paraplegia. We have developed an animal care regimen for rats with complete high-thoracic SCI. Our practices have been refined over the past 7 years, in collaboration with animal care centre staff and veterinarians. During this time, we have cared for more than 300 rats with T3 complete transection SCI, with experimental end-points of up to 3 months. Here we provide details of our animal care procedures, including acclimatization, housing, diet, antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical procedures, post-operative monitoring, and prevention of complications. In our laboratory, this comprehensive approach consistently produces good outcomes following T3 complete transection SCI: using body weight as an objective indicator of animal health, we have found that our rats typically return to pre-operative weights within 10 days of T3 complete SCI. It is our hope that the information provided here will improve care of experimental animals, and facilitate adoption of models that directly address the complications associated with higher level injuries."

                "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting from trauma decreases the quality of human life. Numerous clues indicate that the limited endogenous regenerative potential is a result of the interplay between the inhibitory nature of mature nervous tissue and the inflammatory actions of immune and glial cells. Knowledge gained from comparing regeneration in adult and juvenile animals could draw attention to factors that should be removed or added for effective therapy in adults. Therefore, we generated a minimal SCI (mSCI) model with a comparable impact on the spinal cord of Wistar rats during adulthood, preadolescence, and the neonatal period. The mechanism of injury is based on unilateral incision with a 20\u00a0ga needle tip according to stereotaxic coordinates into the dorsal horn of the L4 lumbar spinal segment. The incision should harm a similar amount of gray matter on a coronal section in each group of experimental animals. According to our results, the impact causes mild injury with minimal adverse effects on the neurological functions of animals but still has a remarkable effect on nervous tissue and its cellular and humoral components. Testing the mSCI model in adults, preadolescents, and neonates revealed a rather anti-inflammatory response of immune cells and astrocytes at the lesion site, as well as increased proliferation in the central canal lining in neonates compared with adult animals. Our results indicate that developing nervous tissue could possess superior reparative potential and confirm the importance of comparative studies to advance in the field of neuroregeneration."

OBJECTIVES: To review animal models and injury paradigms used in the neurobiologic study of spinal cord regeneration, and to assist the spinal clinician in interpreting the many encouraging reports of potential therapies emerging from basic science laboratories. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: An enormous amount of interest in spinal cord regeneration research has been generated within the past 20 years with the hope that experimental therapies will become available for individuals with spinal cord injuries. The use of various animal models in the laboratory setting has been critical to the development of such experimental therapies. METHODS: A literature review was conducted. RESULTS: Experimental interventions in animal models of spinal cord injury were evaluated both anatomically and functionally. Anatomic assessments use various histologic techniques and frequently include the use of anterograde and retrograde axonal tracers. Functional assessments can be performed neurophysiologically or by the observation of motor and sensory performance on a number of different tests. Sharp spinal cord injury paradigms in which the cord is completely or partially transected are useful for assessing axonal regeneration anatomically. In contrast, blunt injury models in which the cord is compressed or contused more accurately mimic the typical human injury and provide a good setting for the study of secondary pathophysiologic processes immediately after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Animal models will continue to play a critical role in the development of experimental therapies for spinal cord injuries. Both sharp and blunt spinal cord injury paradigms have unique characteristics that make them useful in addressing slightly different neurobiologic problems."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Translating basic science research into a safe and effective therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) requires suitable large animal models for testing both implantable devices and biologic approaches to better approximate human anatomy and function. Hemisection lesions, routinely used for investigational purposes in small animals, are less frequently described in large animals that might be appropriate for translational studies. Size constraints of small animals (mice and rats) limits the predictability of the findings when scaled up. Our goal is to review the status of hemisection SCI in large animals across species and time to prepare for the testing of a novel intradural spinal cord stimulation device for control of spasticity in an ovine model. Methods and Results: We surveyed the literature on hemisection in quadrupeds and nonhuman primates, and catalogued the species, protocols and outcomes of the experimental work in this field. Feline, lapine, canine, simian, porcine, ovine and bovine models were the primary focal points. There is a consistent body of literature reporting use of the hemisection approach in large animals, but with differences in surgical technique depending on the goals and nature of the individual studies. While the injuries are not always consistent, the experimental variability is generally lower than that of the contusion-based approach. In general, as the body size of the animal increases, animal care requirements and the associated costs follow. In most cases, this is inversely correlated with the number of animals used in hemisection models. Conclusions: The hemisection approach to modeling SCI is straightforward compared with other methods such as the contusive impact and enables the transection of isolated ascending and descending tracts and segment specific cell bodies. This has certain advantages in models investigating post-injury axonal regrowth. However, this approach is not generally in line with the patho-physiologies encountered in SCI patients. Even so, the ability to achieve more control over the level of injury makes it a useful adjunct to contusive and ischemic approaches, and suggests a useful role in future translational studies."

                "abstract": "Incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to impairments of sensorimotor functions and is clinically the most frequent type of SCI. Human Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome\u00a0is a common type of incomplete SCI caused by a lesion to one half of the spinal cord which results in paralysis and loss of\u00a0proprioception\u00a0on the same (or ipsilesional) side as the injury, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite (or contralesional) side. Adequate methodologies for producing a spinal cord lateral hemisection (HX) and assessing neurological impairments are essential to establish a reliable animal model of Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome. Although lateral hemisection model plays a pivotal role in basic and translational research, standardized protocols for creating such a hemisection and assessing unilateralized function are lacking. The goal of this study is to describe step-by-step procedures to produce a rat spinal lateral HX at the 9th thoracic (T9) vertebral level. We, then, describe a combined behavior scale for HX (CBS-HX) that provides a simple and sensitive assessment of asymmetric neurological performance for unilateral SCI. The CBS-HX, ranging from 0 to 18, is composed of 4 individual assessments which include unilateral hindlimb stepping (UHS), coupling, contact placing, and grid walking. For CBS-HX, the ipsilateral and contralateral hindlimbs are assessed separately. We found that, after a T9 HX, the ipsilateral hindlimb showed impaired behavior function whereas the contralateral hindlimb showed substantial recovery. The CBS-HX effectively discriminated behavioral functions between ipsilateral and contralateral hindlimbs and detected temporal progression of recovery of the ipsilateral hindlimb. The CBS-HX components can be analyzed separately or in combination with other measures when needed. Although we only provided visual descriptions of the surgical procedures and behavioral assessments of a thoracic HX, the principle may be applied to other incomplete SCIs and at other levels of the injury."

In this study, the radiofrequency (RF) lesion was used for inducing an experimental SCI in cats. The neuropathology was correlated with the MRI. In this model, 4 cats were injured at the thoracic spinal cord (T11-T12) with a lesion of 65 degrees C for 1 min using a micromanipulated penetrating RF electrode. The MRI of the lesions after 2, 3, 5, and 6 weeks post-injury as well as the correlative histological changes were obtained. The RF-induced lesion was discrete with little spreading across the spinal cord. There was a good correlation between the histopathology findings and the MRI. We conclude that experimental RF lesioning of the spinal cord can produce a consistent lesion with predictable histopathological changes in experimental animals. A 65 degree C injury for 1 min induced a clinical picture of an incomplete SCI. The RF lesioning should be considered as a new model to study SCI, particularly those with a penetrating component."

                "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI), a debilitating medical condition that can cause irreversible loss of neurons and permanent paralysis, currently has no cure. However, regenerative medicine may offer a promising treatment. Given that numerous regenerative strategies aim to deliver cells and materials in the form of tissue-engineered therapies, understanding and characterising the mechanical properties of the spinal cord tissue is very important. In this study, we have systematically characterised the spatiotemporal changes in elastic stiffness (elastic modulus, Pa) and viscosity (drop in peak force, %) of injured rat thoracic spinal cord tissues at distinct time points after crush injury using the indentation technique. Our results demonstrate that in comparison with uninjured spinal cord tissue, the injured tissues exhibited lower stiffness (median 3281 Pa versus 9632 Pa; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but demonstrated elevated viscosity (median 80% versus 57%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at 3 days postinjury. Between 4 and 6 weeks after SCI, the overall viscoelastic properties of injured tissues returned to baseline values. At 12 weeks after SCI, in comparison with uninjured tissue, the injured spinal cord tissues displayed a significant increase in both elasticity (median 13698 Pa versus 9920 Pa; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and viscosity (median 64% versus 58%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This work constitutes the first quantitative mapping of spatiotemporal changes in spinal cord tissue elasticity and viscosity in injured rats, providing a mechanical basis of the tissue for future studies on the development of biomaterials for SCI repair. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease often leading to permanent paralysis. While enormous progress in understanding the molecular pathomechanisms of SCI has been made, the mechanical properties of injured spinal cord tissue have received considerably less attention. This study provides systematic characterization of the biomechanical evolution of rat spinal cord tissue after SCI using a microindentation test method. We find spinal cord tissue behaves significantly softer but more viscous immediately postinjury. As time passes, the lesion site gradually returns to baseline values and then displays pronounced increased viscoelastic properties. As host tissue mechanical properties are a crucial consideration for any biomaterial implanted into central nervous system, our results may have important implications for further studies of SCI repair."

Considerable basic and clinical research is directed at attenuating these deficits. Many basic scientists use animal models of SCI to (1) characterize lesion development, (2) determine the role of spared axons in recovery, and (3) develop therapeutic interventions based on these findings. In this article, current research is reviewed that indicates: (1) most individuals with SCI will have some sparing of white matter at the lesion epicenter even when the lesion appears clinically complete, (2) even minimal tissue sparing has a profound impact on segmental systems and recovery of function, and (3) facilitatory intervention such as weight bearing and locomotor training after SCI may be more effective than compensatory strategies at inducing neuroplasticity and motor recovery. Body weight supported treadmill step training is discussed as an example of new facilitatory interventions based on basic science research using animal models."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequent and debilitating conditions leading to gastroenterological referrals. However, recommended treatments remain limited, yielding only limited therapeutic gains. Chitin-glucan (CG) is a novel dietary prebiotic classically used in humans at a dosage of 1.5-3.0 g/d and is considered a safe food ingredient by the European Food Safety Authority. To provide an alternative approach to managing patients with IBS, we performed preclinical molecular, cellular, and animal studies to evaluate the role of chitin-glucan in the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS. AIM: To evaluate the roles of CG in visceral analgesia, intestinal inflammation, barrier function, and to develop computational molecular models. METHODS: Visceral pain was recorded through colorectal distension (CRD) in a model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity induced by an intra-rectal administration of TNBS [15 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)] in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracolonic pressure was regularly assessed during the 9 wk-experiment (weeks 0, 3, 5, and 7) in animals receiving CG (n = 14) at a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.5 g/d or 3.0 g/d and compared to negative control (tap water, n = 11) and positive control (phloroglucinol at 1.5 g/d HED, n = 8) groups. The anti-inflammatory effect of CG was evaluated using clinical and histological scores in 30 C57bl6 male mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administered in their drinking water during 14 d. HT-29 cells under basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with CG to evaluate changes in pathways related to analgesia (\u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, inflammation [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1b, and IL-8] and barrier function [mucin 2-5AC, claudin-2, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2] using the real-time PCR method. Molecular modelling of CG, LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and phospholipomannan (PLM) was developed, and the ability of CG to chelate microbial pathogenic lipids was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. RESULTS: Daily CG orally-administered to rats or mice was well tolerated without including diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity, or inflammation, as evaluated at histological and molecular levels. In a model of CRD, CG at a dosage of 3 g/d HED significantly decreased visceral pain perception by 14% after 2 wk of administration (P < 0.01) and reduced inflammation intensity by 50%, resulting in complete regeneration of the colonic mucosa in mice with DSS-induced colitis. To better reproduce the characteristics of visceral pain in patients with IBS, we then measured the therapeutic impact of CG in rats with TNBS-induced inflammation to long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. CG at a dosage of 1.5 g/d HED decreased visceral pain perception by 20% five weeks after colitis induction (P < 0.01). When the CG dosage was increased to 3.0 g/d HED, this analgesic effect surpassed that of the spasmolytic agent phloroglucinol, manifesting more rapidly within 3 wk and leading to a 50% inhibition of pain perception (P < 0.0001). The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CG involved, at least in part, a significant induction of MOR, CB2 receptor, and IL-10, as well as a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8. CG also significantly upregulated barrier-related genes including muc5AC, claudin-2, and ZO-2. Molecular modelling of CG revealed a new property of the molecule as a chelator of microbial pathogenic lipids, sequestering gram-negative LPS and gram-positive LTA bacterial toxins, as well as PLM in fungi at the lowesr energy conformations. CONCLUSION: CG decreased visceral perception and intestinal inflammation through master gene regulation and direct binding of microbial products, suggesting that CG may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms."

                "abstract": "Chitin-glucan (CG) is a new generation of prebiotic. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM\u00ae (NCFM) is a probiotic with the ability to decrease abdominal pain. We evaluate the functional and molecular gastrointestinal responses to a synbiotic administration combining CG and NCFM in a rat model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity. The intracolonic pressure was assessed during the 9-week experiment in animals receiving CG in association or not with NCFM and compared to that in Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37\u00ae-treated animals and control rats receiving tap water. The effects of the synbiotic were evaluated using the Wallace score, the quantification of colon myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the master genes driving analgesia and inflammation. CG 1.5 alone and NCFM 109 colony forming units (CFU) alone similarly decreased the visceral pain sensitivity. Lpc-37 had no significant effect. The best profile of pain perception inhibition was obtained with the combination of CG 1.5 g and NCFM 109 CFU, confirming a synbiotic property. This synbiotic treatment significantly reduced macroscopic colonic lesions and MPO concentrations, and induced master genes involved in analgesia (CB1, CB2, MOR, PPAR\u03b1), with a downregulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1) and an induction of IL-10 and PPAR\u03b3. In conclusion, CG 1.5 g + NCFM 109 CFU significantly decreased visceral pain perception and intestinal inflammation through the regulation of master genes."

                "abstract": "Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine Il-1\u03b2 and the inducible enzyme Cox-2, which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins Muc-2 and Muc-3, which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly Muc-3. Moreover, DCA increased the expression of Tlr3, which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor Htr-4, which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chang-Kang-Fang (CKF), originated from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas, has been utilized to treat diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) based on clinical experience. However, the underlying mechanism of CKF for treating IBS-D remains unclear and need further clarification. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this present investigation was to validate the efficacy of CKF on IBS-D model rats and to uncover its potential mechanism for the treatment of IBS-D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first established the IBS-D rat model through neonatal maternal separation (NMS) in combination with restraint stress (RS) and the administration of senna decoction via gavage. To confirm the therapeutic effect of CKF on treating IBS-D, abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores, the quantity of fecal pellets, and the fecal water content (FWC) were measured to evaluate the influence of CKF on visceral hypersensitivity and the severity of diarrhea symptom after the intragastric administration of CKF for 14 days. Subsequently, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the effect of CKF on neuropeptides substance P (SP) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), as well as inflammatory cytokines in serum and in intestinal tissues. Further, colonic pathological changes, the amount of colonic mast cells, and the expression level of occludin in rat colon tissues, were investigated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. To explore the underlying mechanisms, alterations in colonic RNA transcriptomics for the normal, model, and CKF treatment groups were assessed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Subsequently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF) assays were applied to validate the effect of CKF on predicted pathways in vivo and in vitro. In addition, to elucidate the potential active compounds in CKF, 11 representative components found in CKF were selected, and their anti-inflammation potentials were evaluated using LPS-treated RAW264.7\u00a0cell models. RESULTS: CKF treatment significantly reduced the number of fecal pellets, attenuated visceral hypersensitivity, and decreased 5-HT and SP concentrations in serum and colon tissues, along with a reduction in colonic mast cell counts, correlating with improved symptoms in IBS-D rats. Meanwhile, CKF treatment reduced the colonic inflammatory cell infiltration, lowered the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in serum and colon tissues, and increased the occludin protein expression in colon tissues to improve inflammatory response and colonic barrier function. RNA-Seq, in conjugation with our previous network pharmacology analysis, indicated that CKF might mitigate the symptoms of IBS-D rats by inhibiting the Toll like receptor 4/Nuclear factor kappa-B/NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3) pathway, which was confirmed by WB, IF, and qRT-PCR experiments in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, coptisine, berberine, hyperoside, epicatechin, and gallic acid present in CKF emerged as potential active components for treating IBS-D, as they demonstrated in vitro anti-inflammatory effects. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that CKF effectively improves the symptoms of IBS-D rats, potentially through the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway. Moreover, this study unveils the potential bioactive components in CKF that could be applied in the treatment of IBS-D."

                "title": "Chronic colitis-induced visceral pain is associated with increased anxiety during quiescent phase.",
                "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by repetition of flares and remission periods leading to chronic postinflammatory sequelae. Among postinflammatory sequelae, one-third of patients with IBD are suffering from functional symptoms or psychological comorbidities that persist during remission. The aim of our study was to assess functional and behavioral sequelae of chronic colitis in rats with quiescent intestinal inflammation. Chronic colitis was induced by a weekly intrarectal injection of increasing concentrations of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) for 3 wk (15-45 mg of TNBS) in 30 rats, whereas the control rats (n = 24) received the vehicle. At 50 days post-TNBS, visceral sensitivity was assessed by visceromotor response to colorectal distension, and transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) expression was also quantified in the colon and dorsal root ganglia. Barrier function and inflammatory response were assessed by studying intestinal permeability, tight junction protein, myeloperoxidase activity, histological score, and cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1). Anxiety behavioral tests were performed from 50 to 64 days after the last TNBS injection. Chronic TNBS induced 1) a visceral hypersensitivity (P = 0.03), 2) an increased colon weight-to-length ratio (P = 0.01), 3) higher inflammatory and fibrosis scores (P = 0.0390 and P = 0.0016, respectively), and 4) a higher colonic IL-6 and IL-10 production (P = 0.008 and P = 0.005, respectively) compared with control rats. Intestinal permeability, colonic production of TNF-\u03b1, myeloperoxidase activity, and TRPV1 expression did not differ among groups. Chronic TNBS increased anxiety-related behavior in the open-field test and in the acoustic stress test. In conclusion, chronic colitis induced functional sequelae such as visceral hypersensitivity and increased anxiety with a low-grade intestinal inflammation. Development of a representative animal model will allow defining novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a better management of IBD-related sequelae. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have impaired quality of life. Therapeutic progress to control mucosal inflammation provides us an opportunity to develop novel approaches to understand mechanisms behind postinflammatory sequelae. We used a chronic colitis model to study long-term sequelae on visceral pain, gut barrier function, and psychological impact. Chronic colitis induced functional symptoms and increased anxiety in the remission period. It might define novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a better inflammatory bowel disease-related sequelae management."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gelsectan\u00ae is a formulation of xyloglucan (XG), pea protein, grape seed extract (PPGS) and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS). Our aim was to examine the effect of Gelsectan\u00ae on rectal sensitivity in an animal model, abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) subjects and intestinal permeability in both conditions. METHODS: Animals: Wistar rats received gavage with XOS, XG\u00a0+\u00a0PPGS or XG\u00a0+\u00a0PPGS\u00a0+\u00a0XOS, as a single dose or for 7\u00a0days before a partial restraint stress (PRS). Visceromotor response to rectal distension and total gut paracellular permeability to 51Cr-EDTA were assessed. Humans: IBS-D and control patients were involved. After initial colonoscopy with biopsy sampling Gelsectan\u00ae was administered to IBS-D patients for 12\u00a0weeks. Stool count and pain scores were documented. After treatment, colonoscopy was repeated. The permeability of biopsy samples was measured in Ussing-chambers. Adherent mucus layer, Muc-2 expression as well as TNF\u03b1, Interferon IFN\u03b3 were evaluated by histology/immunohistochemistry and ELISA assays, respectively. RESULTS: Animal studies: In control rats, PRS significantly increased visceromotor response as well as gut paracellular permeability. Single dose administration of XG\u00a0+\u00a0PPGS\u00a0+\u00a0XOS failed to reverse PRS, but 7\u00a0days of oral treatment reversed PRS-induced rectal hypersensitivity and gut hyperpermeability. Human studies: Gelsectan\u00ae treatment significantly reduced and abdominal pain. Intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients was elevated compared with controls, Gelsectan\u00ae restored permeability in the ascendent colon. Periodic acid-Schiff-stained mucus layer was significantly thinner in IBS-D patients compared with controls, In both segments, mucus thickness and the proportion of Muc-2 positive cells were not affected by Gelsectan\u00ae treatment. IFN\u03b3 tissue level in the sigmoid colon shows modest mucosal inflammation in IBS-D. CONCLUSIONS: Gelsectan\u00ae prevented rectal hypersensitivity in rats, abdominal pain in human and intestinal hyperpermeability in rat and human studies respectively. These effects involve restoration of gut permeability. Based on this translational study, Gelsectan\u00ae can be considered as an effective therapy for IBS-D symptoms."

                "abstract": "Post inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), a subset of IBS, is characterized by symptoms of visceral pain, bloating, and changed bowel habits that occur post initial episode of intestinal infection. Gut microbial dysbiosis or inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of abdominal hypersensitivity of PI-IBS. Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation results in an alleviated PI-IBS-associated symptom. This study investigated the effect of EA on IL-18 and gut microbial dysbiosis in one visceral hypersensitive rat models with PI-IBS. A trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced visceral hypersensitivity rat model was developed. EA stimulation was applied to the ST25 and ST36 acupoints. Animals were assessed using abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores to determine the development of colonic visceral hypersensitivity. The 16S rRNA was used to correlate microbial diversity. IL-18 expression in colon was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. We identified that model rats had an increased visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distention at different distention pressures compared with the normal group. Sensitivity to colorectal distention decreased after EA stimulation. The composition of the fecal microbiota was different between groups. Specifically, in the model group Empedobacter, Psychrobacter, Enterococcus, Butyricimonas, Vampirovibrio, Kurthia, Intestinimonas, Neisseria, Falsiporphyromonas, Bilophila, Fusobacterium, Alistipes, Veillonella, Flavonifractor, Clostridium XlVa were\u00a0more abundant\u00a0affected genera, whereas Lactobacillus was enriched in normal rats. EA stimulation was correlated with significant decrease in the phyla of Fusobacteria. The mRNA and protein levels of IL-18 were higher in the model group. Meanwhile, EA stimulation attenuated this response. In a word, our findings suggest that PI-IBS is associated with significant increase in IL-18 levels as well as an alteration in microbiome diversity. These changes can be reversed with EA treatment. EA stimulation has a positive effect in alleviating symptoms of visceral hypersensitivity and protecting the gastrointestinal tract."

                "abstract": "AIMS: This study evaluated the efficacy of a repeated oral treatment with two active pharmaceutical ingredients (Lcr Lenio\u00ae and Lcr Restituo\u00ae ) derivated from the probiotic bacterial strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35\u00ae in two animal models mimicking different features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is characterized by visceral pain associated with alteration of bowel transit. IBS patients present visceral hypersensitivity with peripheral and central origins. METHODS AND RESULTS: The injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) into the proximal colon as well as an acute partial restraint stress (PRS) produces colonic hypersensitivity measured in conscious rats by a decrease in pain threshold in response to distal colonic distension. Visceral hypersensitivity was produced by injection of TNBS 7\u00a0days before colonic distension or by acute PRS on testing day. Treatments were performed once a day during eight consecutive days. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that an 8-day probiotic treatment (Lcr Lenio and Lcr Restituo) produces an antihypersensitivity activity in both TNBS and PRS visceral pain models. As this probiotic strain attenuates peripherally and centrally induced visceral hypersensitivity in rats, it may be active in treatment of IBS symptoms. An immunomodulatory effect of the probiotics was highlighted in the TNBS model on the IL-23 secretion, suggesting a mechanism of action involving a regulation of the local IL-23/Th17 immune activation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Two formulas of Lcr35\u00ae probiotic strain show very encouraging results for the treatment of IBS patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the role and mechanisms of probiotics on the pathogenesis of IBS."

                "abstract": "Intestinal enterochromaffin (EC) cell hyperplasia and increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) availability play key roles in the pathogenesis of abdominal hypersensitivity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aims to study the effect of quercetin on visceral pain and 5-HT availability in postinflammatory IBS (PI-IBS) rats. PI-IBS model rats were administered quercetin by gavage at doses of 5, 10, and 20\u2009mg/kg for 14 days. Compared with normal rats, the visceral pain threshold of PI-IBS rats was markedly decreased and the abdominal motor response to colon distension was markedly increased. The EC cell count and 5-HT level, as well as tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) protein, were all significantly elevated in PI-IBS rats, while the 5-HT reuptake transporter (serotonin transporter) was reduced. Genes that are responsible for enteroendocrine cell differentiation, that is, Ngn3 and pdx1, were significantly increased in the PI-IBS group. Quercetin treatment markedly elevated the pain threshold pressure and decreased the visceral motor response of PI-IBS animals; and EC cell density and 5-HT level, as well as TPH expression, in the PI-IBS group were all reduced by quercetin. Quercetin treatment also significantly reduced colonic expression of Ngn3 and pdx1 of PI-IBS. Findings from the present study indicated that the analgesic effect of quercetin on PI-IBS may result from reduction of 5-HT availability in the colon, and the regulatory role of quercetin in endocrine progenitors may contribute to reduced EC cells."

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and related mechanisms of TXYF in an IBS-D rat model. METHODS: The IBS-D rat model was established with 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Then, IBS-D rats were divided into control, TXYF and rifaximin groups and treated intragastrically with normal saline, TXYF and rifaximin, respectively, for 14\u2009days. The following indicators were measured before and after treatment: defecation frequency, faecal water content (FWC) and colorectal distension (CRD). Histopathological changes in the distal colon were observed after treatment. The expression of OCLN and ZO1 in the distal colon of IBS-D rats reflected the intestinal mucosal permeability, as measured by qRT-PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The NF-\u03baB and Notch signalling pathways and inflammation-related factors were investigated. RESULTS: After treatment with TXYF, the defecation frequency, FWC and CRD were significantly lower than those in the model group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). HE staining showed that colonic epithelial cells (CECs) in the IBS-D rats displayed significant oedema, impaired intestinal mucosal integrity and an increased influx of inflammatory cells. A significant reduction in granulocyte and CEC oedema was observed after the administration of TXYF and rifaximin compared to that of the model group and blank group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). TXYF significantly upregulated the expression of OCLN and ZO-1 and downregulated inflammation-related factors (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 and the chemokine KC) in IBS-D rats compared to those in the model group rats (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In terms of the NF-\u03baB and Notch signalling pathways, the expression of NICD, p-ERK, Hes-1 and p-P65 decreased significantly in the TXYF and rifaximin groups, while the expression of ATOH1 increased significantly compared to that in the model group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: TXYF can effectively improve intestinal permeability and enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function, which may be related to inhibition of the inflammatory cascade and the NF-\u03baB and Notch signalling pathways."

                "abstract": "So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HT3AR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HT3AR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.-Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

There is increasing evidence suggesting the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBS, which addresses the possibility that formerly established rat model of colitis could be used as an IBS model after the inflammation subsided. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of 4% acetic acid in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The extent of inflammation was assessed by histological examination and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay. After subsidence of colitis, the rats were subjected to rectal distension and restraint stress, then the abdominal withdrawal reflex and the number of stress-induced fecal output were measured, respectively. RESULTS: At 2 days post-induction of colitis, the colon showed characteristic inflammatory changes in histology and 8-fold increase in MPO activity. At 7 days post-induction of colitis, the histological features and MPO activity returned to normal. The rats at 7 days post-induction of colitis showed hypersensitive response to rectal distension without an accompanying change in rectal compliance, and defecated more stools than control animals when under stress. CONCLUSION: These results concur largely with the characteristic features of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity and altered defecation pattern in the absence of detectable disease, suggesting that this animal model is a methodologically convenient and useful model for studying a subset of IBS."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among the different mechanisms involved in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) physiopathology, visceral hypersensitivity seems to play a key role. It involves sensitization of the colonic primary afferent fibers, especially through an overexpression of ion channels. The aims of this translational study were to investigate the colonic expression of Cav 3.2 calcium channels and their involvement in an animal model of colonic hypersensitivity, and to assess their expression in the colonic mucosa of symptomatic IBS patients. METHODS: This bench-to-bed study combined a preclinical experimental study on mice and a case-control clinical study. Preclinical studies were performed on wild-type and Cav 3.2-KO mice. Colonic sensitivity and Cav 3.2 expression were studied after a low-dose treatment of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS 0.5%). Regarding the clinical study, colonic biopsies were performed in 14 IBS patients and 16 controls during a colonoscopy to analyze the mucosal Cav 3.2 expression. KEY RESULTS: Wild-type, but not Cav 3.2-KO, mice developed visceral hypersensitivity without colonic inflammation, after 0.5% DSS treatment. A significant increase of Cav 3.2 mRNA (p = 0.04) was found in the colon of low-dose DSS-treated wild-type (WT) mice compared to their controls. In human colonic biopsies, the Cav 3.2 mRNA level was significantly higher in the IBS group compared to the control group (p = 0.01). The immunofluorescence staining revealed their protein expression in colonic mucosa, particularly in nerve fibers. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This translational study supports the involvement of the calcium channels Cav 3.2 in abdominal pain, as observed in IBS patients. It opens new therapeutic perspectives based on molecules specifically blocking these channels."

Nevertheless, the effect and mechanism of Atractylodes on IBS-D are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to confirm the therapeutic effect of Atractylodes lanceolata oil (AO) in a rat model of IBS-D, and to determine the mechanisms by which AO protects against the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical components in AO were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The expression levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and surfactant protein (SP) in serum and colon tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to elucidate the mechanism of action of AO toward inflammation and the intestinal barrier in a rat model of IBS-D. RESULTS: The 15 chemical substances of the highest concentration in AO were identified using GC-MS. AO was effective against IBS-D in the rat model, in terms of increased body weight, diarrhea grade score, levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), aquaporin 3 (AQP3), and aquaporin 8 (AQP8), and reduced fecal moisture content, levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 5-HT, VIP, and SP, while also reducing intestinal injury, as observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. In addition, the results indicated that AO increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of stem cell factor (SCF) and c-kit and enhanced the levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, as well as decreased the levels of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and inhibited the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC2). CONCLUSIONS: AO was found to be efficacious in the rat model of IBS-D. AO inhibited the SCF/c-kit pathway, thereby reducing inflammation and protecting against intestinal barrier damage via the MLCK/MLC2 pathway."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether colonic mucosal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) participates in visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were administered intrarectally with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) for the establishment of an IBS-like visceral hypersensitivity model. Those received an equivalent volume of 50% ethanol were regarded as the controls. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores in response to colorectal distention (CRD) were used to assess visceral sensitivity. NMDAR levels in the colonic mucosa were detected by both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The concentrations of glutamate and ammonia in the feces of the mice were measured. Changes in visceral sensitivity after the intracolonic administration of ammonia or NMDAR antagonist were recorded. RESULTS: The established IBS-like mouse model of visceral hypersensitivity showed no evident inflammation in the colon. NMDAR levels in the colonic mucosa of the IBS-like mice were significantly higher compared with the controls, and were positively associated with AWR scores. The glutamate level in the feces of the TNBS-treated mice was similar to that of the controls, although the ammonia level was significantly higher. Intracolonic administration of ammonia induced visceral hypersensitivity in mice, which was repressed by pretreatment with NMDAR antagonist MK801. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpressed NMDAR in the colonic mucosa may participate in the pathogenesis of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Our study identifies the effect of ammonia in the colonic lumen on NMDAR in the colonic mucosa as a potential novel targeted mechanism for IBS treatment."

                "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the role of P2Y1R in visceral hypersensitivity in rats with experimental irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A rat model of irritable bowel syndrome was generated by intra-colonic administration of acetic acid (AA) and assessed by histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay. Then P2Y1R expression in the colonic tissue was detected by Western blot. In order to explore the regulatory role of P2Y1R in visceral hypersensitivity, an agonist (MRS2365) and an antagonist (MRS2179) of P2Y1R were intra-colonically administered and effects were tested through a colorectal distension test. The abdominal withdrawal reflex and abdominal electromyography were tested during the course. RESULTS: Model assessment tests showed an obvious inflammatory reaction that appeared on the 2nd d after the AA injection, and the inflammatory reaction gradually recovered and almost disappeared on the 7th d. The model finished on day 8 and showed a clear feature of IBS that had no organic lesion. The average expression of P2Y1R was significantly higher in the AA group than in the na\u00efve group (0.319 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.094 \u00b1 0.016, P < 0.001). MRS2365 could effectively raise the colonic hypersensitivity status at intervention doses of 10 (AUC value from 0.30 \u00b1 0.089 to 1.973 \u00b1 0.127 mv\u00b7s, P < 0.01) and 100 \u03bcmol/L (AUC value from 0.290 \u00b1 0.079 to 1.983 \u00b1 0.195 mv\u00b7s, P < 0.01); MRS2179 could effectively reduce the hypersensitivity status at intervention dose of 100 \u03bcmol/L (from a mean baseline AUC value of 1.587 \u00b1 0.099 mv\u00b7s to 0.140 \u00b1 0.089 mv\u00b7s, P < 0.0001). Differences between the MRS2179 group (1.88 \u00b1 1.45) and either the MRS2365 group (3.96 \u00b1 0.19) or the combined treatment (MRS2179 and MRS2365) group (3.28 \u00b1 0.11) were significant (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: P2Y1R plays a regulatory role in visceral hypersensitivity in rats with experimental IBS. Specific antagonists of P2Y1R may have potential therapeutic value in treating abdominal pain in IBS."

METHODS: Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into blank, model, electroacupuncture (EA), and agonist groups, with 10 rats in each group. Except for the blank group, rats in the other groups were given folium sennae infusion by gavage combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress to establish IBS-D model. Rats in the EA group received acupuncture at \"Tianshu\"(ST25) and EA at \"Zusanli\"(ST36) and \"Taichong\"(LR3) (2 Hz/15 Hz) on one side for 20 min, with the side chosen alternately every other day, for 14 days after modeling. Rats in the agonist group received acupuncture 30 min after intravenous injection of CRFR1 agonist urocortin, with the same manipulation method and time as the EA group. Before and after intervention, visceral pain threshold and stool Bristol scores were measured. Elevated plus maze test and open field test were used to detect anxiety and depression like behavior of rats. ELISA was used to detect the contents of CRF and CRFR1 in rats serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the positive expressions of CRF, CRFR1, zonula occludens protein 1(ZO-1), occlusal protein(Occludin), and closure protein 1 (Claudin-1) in colon tissue. RESULTS: Compared with the blank group, the visceral pain threshold, open arm time percentage (OT%), total distance of movement in the open field test, and positive expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 in colon were decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), while Bristol stool scores, serum CRF and CRFR1 contents, and positive expressions of CRF and CRFR1 in colon were increased (P<0.01) in the model group. After intervention and compared with the model group, the visceral pain threshold, OT%, total distance of movement in the open field test, and positive expressions of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 in colon were increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while Bristol stool scores, serum CRF and CRFR1 contents, and positive expressions of CRF and CRFR1 in colon were decreased (P<0.01) in the EA group\uff1bthe Bristol stool scores, serum CRF content, and CRF positive expression in colon were significantly decreased in the agonist group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Peitu Yimu acupuncture can significantly improve visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-depression state in IBS-D rats. Its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of CRF/CRFR1 pathway and restoration of intestinal tight junction protein expressions."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is linked to post-inflammatory and stress-correlated factors that cause changes in the perception of visceral events. Probiotic bacteria may be effective in treating IBS symptoms. Here, we have investigated whether early life administration of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, protects against development of visceral hypersensitivity driven by neonatal maternal separation (NMS), a rat model of IBS. METHODS: Male NMS pups were treated orally with placebo or VSL#3 from days 3 to 60, while normal, not separated rats were used as controls. After 60 days from birth, perception of painful sensation induced by colorectal distension (CRD) was measured by assessing the abdominal withdrawal reflex (score 0-4). The colonic gene expression was assessed by using the Agilent Whole Rat Genome Oligo Microarrays platform and confirmed by real time PCR. RESULTS: NMS rats exhibited both hyperalgesia and allodynia when compared to control rats. VSL#3 had a potent analgesic effect on CRD-induced pain without changing the colorectal compliance. The microarray analysis demonstrated that NMS induces a robust change in the expression of subsets of genes (CCL2, NOS3, THP1, NTRK1, CCR2, BDRKRB1, IL-10, TNFRSF1B, TRPV4, CNR1 and OPRL1) involved in pain transmission and inflammation. TPH1, tryptophan hydroxylase 1, a validated target gene in IBS treatment, was markedly upregulated by NMS and this effect was reversed by VSL#3 intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Early life administration of VSL#3 reduces visceral pain perception in a model of IBS and resets colonic expression of subsets of genes mediating pain and inflammation.

In this study we investigated the effects of Chang'an II on the intestinal mucosal immune barrier in a rat post-inflammation IBS (PI-IBS) model. METHODS: A rat model of PI-IBS was established using a multi-stimulation paradigm including early postnatal sibling deprivation, bondage and intrarectal administration of TNBS. Four weeks after TNBS administration, the rats were treated with Chang'an II (2.85, 5.71 and 11.42 g \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1), ig) for 14 d. Intestinal sensitivity was assessed based on the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores and fecal water content. Open field test and two-bottle sucrose intake test were used to evaluate the behavioral changes. CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were counted and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-4 levels were measured in intestinal mucosa. Transmission electron microscopy was used to evaluate ultrastructural changes of the intestinal mucosal barrier. RESULTS: PI-IBS model rats showed significantly increased AWR reactivity and fecal water content, and decreased locomotor activity and sucrose intake. Chang'an II treatment not only reduced AWR reactivity and fecal water content, but also suppressed the anxiety and depressive behaviors. Ultrastructural study revealed that the gut mucosal barrier function was severely damaged in PI-IBS model rats, whereas Chang'an II treatment relieved intestinal mucosal inflammation and repaired the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, PI-IBS model rats showed a significantly reduced CD4(+)/CD8(+) cell ratio in lamina propria and submucosa, and increased IL-1\u03b2 and reduced IL-4 expression in intestinal mucosa, whereas Chang'an II treatment reversed PI-IBS-induced changes in CD4(+)/CD8(+) cell ratio and expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-4. CONCLUSION: Chang'an II treatment protects the intestinal mucosa against PI-IBS through anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-anxiety effects."

The aims of the present study were to determine whether orally administered glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius could attenuate or prevent the development of experimental colitis in mice. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by treatment with 3.5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 18 d. Before or after DSS administration, mice were given hot water solubles (HWS) or mycelium extract (ME) (2 or 20 mg per mouse) daily in their food. Colonic damage was macroscopically and histologically evaluated. Inflammation was assessed by changes in colon length, TNF-alpha levels released by colonic samples in organ culture and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1beta) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in colonic samples were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. P. pulmonarius glucans attenuated and prevented the development of symptoms associated with DSS-induced colitis. High doses of HWS and ME blocked colon shortening, suppressed MPO activity and improved macroscopic score in all treatment groups. In addition, histological damage from colitis was reduced by HWS and ME at all doses. The tissue levels of TNF-alpha protein were significantly decreased and correlated with degree of inflammation and macroscopic score. All treatments significantly attenuated the increased DSS-mediated expression levels of IL-1beta. We conclude that the different glucan preparations (HWS or ME) harvested from P. pulmonarius when orally administered to DSS-treated mice attenuate the development of colonic inflammation, suggesting putative clinical utility for these extracts in the treatment of colitis."

                "abstract": "Transient inflammation is known to alter visceral sensory function and frequently precede the onset of symptoms in a subgroup of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Duration and severity of the initial inflammatory stimulus appear to be risk factors for the manifestation of symptoms. Therefore, we aimed to characterize dose-dependent effects of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol on: (1) colonic mucosa, (2) cytokine release and (3) visceral sensory function in a rat model. Acute inflammation was induced in male Lewis rats by single administration of various doses of TNBS/ethanol (total of 0.8, 0.4 or 0.2 ml) in test animals or saline in controls. Assessment of visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distensions, histological evaluation of severity of inflammation, and measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-6) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed 2h and 3, 14, 28, 31 and 42 days after induction. Increased serum IL-2 and IL-6 levels were evident prior to mucosal lesions 2h after induction of colitis and persist up to 14 days (p<0.05 vs. saline), although no histological signs of inflammation were detected at 14 days. In the acute phase, VMR was only significantly increased after 0.8 ml and 0.4 ml TNBS/ethanol (p<0.05 vs. saline). After 28 days, distension-evoked responses were persistently elevated (p<0.05 vs. saline) in 0.8 and 0.4 ml TNBS/ethanol-treated rats. In 0.2 ml TNBS/ethanol group, VMR was only enhanced after repeated visceral stimulation. Visceral hyperalgesia occurs after a transient colitis. However, even a mild acute but asymptomatic colitis can induce long-lasting visceral hyperalgesia in the presence of additional stimuli."

            "abstract": "Severity of neural injury including stroke in human patients, as well as recovery from injury, can be assessed through changes in gait patterns of affected individuals. Similar quantification of motor function deficits has been measured in rodent animal models of such injuries. However, due to differences in fundamental structure of human and rodent brains, there is a need to develop a large animal model to facilitate treatment development for neurological conditions. Porcine brain structure is similar to that of humans, and therefore the pig may make a more clinically relevant animal model. The current study was undertaken to determine key gait characteristics in normal biomedical miniature pigs and dynamic changes that occur post-neural injury in a porcine middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion ischemic stroke model. Yucatan miniature pigs were trained to walk through a semi-circular track and were recorded with high speed cameras to detect changes in key gait parameters. Analysis of normal pigs showed overall symmetry in hindlimb swing and stance times, forelimb stance time, along with step length, step velocity, and maximum hoof height on both fore and hindlimbs. A subset of pigs were again recorded at 7, 5 and 3 days prior to MCA occlusion and then at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days following surgery. MRI analysis showed that MCA occlusion resulted in significant infarction. Gait analysis indicated that stroke resulted in notable asymmetries in both temporal and spatial variables. Pigs exhibited lower maximum front hoof height on the paretic side, as well as shorter swing time and longer stance time on the paretic hindlimb. These results support that gait analysis of stroke injury is a highly sensitive detection method for changes in gait parameters in pig."

                "abstract": "The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) has recommended that novel therapeutics be tested in a large animal model with similar anatomy and physiology to humans. The pig is an attractive model due to similarities in brain size, organization, and composition relative to humans. However, multiple pig breeds have been used to study ischemic stroke with potentially differing cerebral anatomy, architecture and, consequently, ischemic stroke pathologies. The objective of this study was to characterize brain anatomy and assess spatiotemporal gait parameters in Yucatan (YC) and Landrace (LR) pigs pre- and post-stroke using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gait analysis, respectively. Ischemic stroke was induced via permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). MRI was performed pre-stroke and 1-day post-stroke. Structural and diffusion-tensor sequences were performed at both timepoints and analyzed for cerebral characteristics, lesion diffusivity, and white matter changes. Spatiotemporal and relative pressure gait measurements were collected pre- and 2-days post-stroke to characterize and compare acute functional deficits. The results from this study demonstrated that YC and LR pigs exhibit differences in gross brain anatomy and gait patterns pre-stroke with MRI and gait analysis showing statistical differences in the majority of parameters. However, stroke pathologies in YC and LR pigs were highly comparable post-stroke for most evaluated MRI parameters, including lesion volume and diffusivity, hemisphere swelling, ventricle compression, caudal transtentorial and foramen magnum herniation, showing no statistical difference between the breeds. In addition, post-stroke changes in velocity, cycle time, swing percent, cadence, and mean hoof pressure showed no statistical difference between the breeds. These results indicate significant differences between pig breeds in brain size, anatomy, and motor function pre-stroke, yet both demonstrate comparable brain pathophysiology and motor outcomes post-stroke. The conclusions of this study suggest pigs of these different breeds generally show a similar ischemic stroke response and findings can be compared across porcine stroke studies that use different breeds."

                "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in enduring motor and cognitive dysfunction. Although gait disturbances have been documented among TBI patients, few studies have profiled gait abnormalities in animal models of TBI. We sought to obtain a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of gait function following severe penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) in rats. Rats were subjected to either unilateral frontal PBBI, probe insertion alone, or sham surgery. Sensorimotor performance was assessed using the CatWalk automated gait analysis system. Baseline measurements were taken 3 days prior to injury and detailed analysis of gait was performed at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-injury. Both PBBI and probe-inserted rats displayed altered static and dynamic gait parameters that were primarily evident during the early (<7 days) post-injury phase and were resolved by 1 month post-injury. PBBI produced more severe deficits compared to probe-alone which were reflected in the number, magnitude, and resolution time of abnormal gait parameters. While altered parameters were detected in all four paws, they were more apparent on the contralateral side. Gait parameters including paw pressure, print area, swing speed, and stride length were significantly decreased whereas stance, swing, and step cycle duration were increased compared to sham. Overall, altered gait patterns detected using the CatWalk system in the PBBI model were injury-severity dependent, resolved at later time points, and appeared similar to those reported in severe TBI patients. These results indicate that the CatWalk may be most useful for neuroprotection studies that focus on the acute/subacute recovery period after TBI."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent work from our group suggests that human neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (NSC EV) treatment improves both tissue and sensorimotor function in a preclinical thromboembolic mouse model of stroke. In this study, NSC EVs were evaluated in a pig ischemic stroke model, where clinically relevant end points were used to assess recovery in a more translational large animal model. METHODS: Ischemic stroke was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and either NSC EV or PBS treatment was administered intravenously at 2, 14, and 24 hours post-MCAO. NSC EV effects on tissue level recovery were evaluated via magnetic resonance imaging at 1 and 84 days post-MCAO. Effects on functional recovery were also assessed through longitudinal behavior and gait analysis testing. RESULTS: NSC EV treatment was neuroprotective and led to significant improvements at the tissue and functional levels in stroked pigs. NSC EV treatment eliminated intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic lesions in NSC EV pigs (0 of 7) versus control pigs (7 of 8). NSC EV-treated pigs exhibited a significant decrease in cerebral lesion volume and decreased brain swelling relative to control pigs 1-day post-MCAO. NSC EVs significantly reduced edema in treated pigs relative to control pigs, as assessed by improved diffusivity through apparent diffusion coefficient maps. NSC EVs preserved white matter integrity with increased corpus callosum fractional anisotropy values 84 days post-MCAO. Behavior and mobility improvements paralleled structural changes as NSC EV-treated pigs exhibited improved outcomes, including increased exploratory behavior and faster restoration of spatiotemporal gait parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated for the first time that in a large animal model novel NSC EVs significantly improved neural tissue preservation and functional levels post-MCAO, suggesting NSC EVs may be a paradigm changing stroke therapeutic."

Gait analysis has been employed clinically in stroke patients for their rehabilitation planning. In animal studies, gait analysis has been employed for the assessment of their locomotive disturbances in ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease. The aims of the work reported here were to identify the gait parameters, collected from the computer-generated CatWalk System, that change after unilateral intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the acute stage and long term up to 56 days post-ICH. The results showed that with the collagenase-induced unilateral striatal lesion, the rats displayed a significant contralateral decrease in print and maximum contact area and paw intensity, a diagonal increase in the stance duration of the left front and right hind paws, a significant decrease in the stride length of all four limbs, and foot pattern instability as reflected by the base of support, support on styles, and cadence. These deficits, including those in print area, stance and pressure, were demonstrated throughout the long-term period following ICH. The correlations between the gait parameters, lesion volume and asymmetrical forelimb use were also reported in this paper. This work has provided a systematic description on gait parameters in the classical striatal ICH model, which might become an essential assessment tool in future studies of pathophysiology and the development of novel treatments for experimental unilateral intracerebral hemorrhage with gait deficits.

However, the relationship between gait disturbances and dopamine depletion following 6-OHDA infusion has not been determined. The present study investigated the longitudinal changes of spatiotemporal gait patterns using a walkway system to acquire footprints and lateral limb images over a 6-week period following unilateral 6-OHDA injection into the medial forebrain bundle of rats. Our results indicated that hemiparkinsonian rats exhibited changes in gait patterns, as compared to normal controls, and pre-lesion levels, including a significantly decreased walking speed and step/stride length as well as an increased base of support and foot angle. The relative percentage of the gait cycle was also altered, showing an increase in the stance to swing ratio, which was more evident in the affected hindlimb. Time-course observations showed that these gait disturbances occurred as early as 4 days post-lesion and gradually increased up to 42 days post-injury. The extents of gait disturbances were compared with conventional apomorphine-induced turning behavior and akinesia bar tests, which were also apparent at 4 days post-lesion but remained relatively unchanged after 28 days. Our time-course gait analysis of a unilateral 6-OHDA rodent model provides insight into the compensatory changes of motor functions during the 6-week development of a nigrostriatal lesion, which might be useful for future objective assessment of novel treatments for human PD subjects."

                "title": "Assessing gait impairment after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats using an automated computer-aided control system.",
                "abstract": "Systematic gait analyses have been widely used in clinical settings as a reliable means of evaluating stroke severity and the efficacy of rehabilitation on people. However, the extent of gait changes post-stroke in experimental quadrupeds remains to be explored. To date, gait studies in cerebral ischemia have been limited to the mild ischemia-reperfusion model. However, studies on pathophysiology and therapy of experimental stroke suggest that permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) is more similar to naturally occurring cerebral ischemia in humans. This is the first preclinical study to demonstrate that pMCAO rats can be used to assess long-term functional deficits related to gait by a computer-assisted method. Our gait analysis results demonstrate obvious gait deficits in the acute phase of the disease. During recovery, gait function gradually improved, but deficits were still detectable 42 days post-pMCAO. Objective and accurate photogrammetric parameters were used to illuminate laws of impairment and compensation in rats at different stages of cerebral ischemia in injured and uninjured limbs during walking. Compared to previous gait studies involving transient (t) MCAO rats, gait changes observed in pMCAO rats were more similar to changes following naturally occurring cerebral ischemia in humans. Importantly, the average body rotation and propulsion index, not previously used, are specific parameters for accurately assessing gait function during the acute phase of post-pMCAO. Furthermore, the gait test results revealed significant correlations between the final infarction volume and earlier behavioral outcomes. In conclusion, the gait analysis is a promising tool for assessing cerebral ischemia severity, and that it may provide a new means of investigating mechanisms of cerebral ischemia and evaluating potential therapies.

                "abstract": "Evaluation of functional outcome is widely used across species to assess the recovery process following various pathological conditions, including spinal cord injury, musculo-skeletal injury, mithochondrial disease, neuropathic cancer, Huntington's disease, chronic pain, cortical lesion, and olivocerebellar degeneration among others. The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) recommends multiple endpoints for behavioral studies in pre-clinical stroke research, to demonstrate their clinical relevance. One of the more challenging tasks in experimental stroke research is measuring long-term functional outcome in mice. It is, however, becoming more important, since transgenic mice are increasingly used for modeling human neurological disorders. Using CatWalk, we characterized long-lasting gait/locomotion deficits following mouse distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO). The post-dMCAO assessment was performed at 7, 14, 21, and 28days after experimental ischemia. When compared to sham-operated mice, dMCAO animals displayed a statistically significant decrease in Spatial parameters (such as Paw Area), while the Temporal parameters (Stand, Initial and Terminal Dual Stances) were significantly increased for three weeks after surgery. Kinetic parameters were significantly decreased in dMCAO animals at 7days after dMCAO. The Interlimb coordination group of parameters displayed the strongest deficits at 21days. While CatWalk variables were altered in all paws, the degree of change was greatest for the parameters measured from the Right Front Paw (contralateral to the lesion). All parameters measured in dMCAO and Sham-operated groups reached similar levels at four weeks after the experimental insult, which reflects a spontaneous post-ischemic recovery. Based on our investigation, we conclude that CatWalk represents a relevant and sensitive analysis, which allows long-term characterization of animal functional recovery in the dMCAO model of experimental ischemia."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is little information about the quality of gait in the years following stroke. Long-term changes in mobility, using global indices of function, suggest a decline well after initial rehabilitation. However, global indices of mobility do not reveal more specific changes in walking competency or underlying gait-specific impairment. OBJECTIVES: The authors used a cross-sectional design with gait-specific measures (velocity and symmetry) to investigate whether deterioration in gait occurs over the long term poststroke. METHODS: Data were abstracted from a standardized database containing clinical assessments and spatiotemporal gait analyses for 171 individuals with stroke. Velocity and 3 expressions of symmetry ratios (swing time, stance time, and step length) were calculated for each individual; they were then assigned to 1 of the 5 following groups: 0 to 3, 3 to 12, 12 to 24, 24 to 48, and >48 months poststroke. RESULTS: Swing time, stance time, and step length symmetry demonstrated a systematic linear trend toward greater asymmetry in groups in the later stages poststroke, whereas velocity, neurological deficit, and lower-extremity (LE) motor impairment did not. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of gait, as measured by spatial and temporal symmetry, appears to worsen in later years. These results suggest a dissociation between quantitative measures of gait, such as velocity versus symmetry, and that these parameters may measure independent features. A longitudinal study is needed to confirm the presence and to interpret the clinical meaning of a long-term decline in specific parameters of poststroke gait."

Nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a 16-channel intracortical (IC) electrode array. An ischemic stroke was induced within the hindlimb area of the left motor cortex. The rehabilitation consisted of a repetitive training paradigm over 28 days, initiated on day one (\"Early-onset\", 5 rats) and on day seven, (\"Late-onset\", 4 rats). Data were obtained from IC microstimulation tests, treadmill walking tests, and beam walking tests. Results revealed an expansion of the hindlimb representation within the motor cortex area and an increased amount of cortical firing rate modulation for the \"Early-onset\" group but not for the \"Late-onset\" group. Kinematic data revealed a significant change for both intervention groups. However, this difference was larger for the \"Early-onset\" group. Results from the beam walking test showed functional performance deficits following stroke which returned to pre-stroke level after the rehabilitative training. The results from the present study indicate the existence of a critical time period following stroke where onset of rehabilitative training may be more effective and related to a higher degree of true recovery.

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish whether functional recovery of gait in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis coincides with changes in the temporal patterning of lower extremity muscle activity and coactivity during treadmill walking. METHODS: Electromyographic (EMG) data from both legs, maximum walking speed, the amount of swing phase asymmetry and clinical measures were obtained from a group of post-acute patients with hemiparesis, as early as possible after admission in a rehabilitation centre (mean time post-stroke 35 days) and 1, 3, 6, and 10 weeks later, while all patients participated in a regular rehabilitation program. EMG data from the first assessment were compared to those obtained from a group of healthy controls to identify abnormalities in the temporal patterning of muscle activity. Within subject comparisons of patient data were made over time to investigate whether functional gait recovery was accompanied by changes in the temporal patterns muscle (co-)activity. RESULTS: EMG patterns during the first assessment showed a number of abnormalities on the paretic side, namely abnormally long durations of activity in biceps femoris (BF) during the single support (SS) phase and in gastrocnemius medialis (GM) during the first double support phase (DS1). Furthermore, in both legs a prolongation of the activity was seen in the rectus femoris (RF) during the SS phase. In addition, the duration of BF-RF coactivation was longer on the paretic side than it was in controls. Over time, the level of ambulatory independence, body mobility, and maximum walking speed increased significantly, indicating that substantial improvements in gait ability occurred. Despite these improvements, durations of muscle (co-) activity and the level of swing phase asymmetry did not change during rehabilitation. More specifically, timing abnormalities in muscle (co-)activity that were found during the first assessment did not change significantly, indicating that these aberrations were not an impediment for functional gait improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of the temporal patterning of gait related muscle activity in the lower extremities is not a prerequisite for functional recovery of gait in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis. Apparently, physiological processes other than improved temporal muscular coordination must be important determinants of the restoration of ambulatory capacity after stroke. SIGNIFICANCE: Recovery of walking ability in post-stroke hemiparesis is not necessarily associated with, or dependent on, reorganization in the temporal control of gait related muscle activity. Normalization of the temporal coordination of muscle activity during gait may not be an important clinical goal during post-acute rehabilitation."

                "abstract": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of moderate and excessive gait training intensities on motor recovery in sub-acute stroke. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats after stroke surgery were randomized into two groups: moderate training group (MTG) and excessive training group (ETG). MTG had 15 minutes of body weight support (BWS) treadmill training per session with three sessions per day on alternative days until 8 days after stroke; and in the ETG, rats had to run until they could not keep up with the treadmill speed for one session on each training day. The intramuscular EMG signal from medial gastrocnemius was used to monitor the muscle activation patterns on both unaffected and affected sides during training. RESULTS: After 4 days post-stroke, the results showed a better recovery in the symmetry gait pattern in the MTG, but there is no such trend observed in the ETG. Moreover, the MTG has a better motor behaviour score and the affected side could bear more body weight. These results were reflected in the increase in the EMG burst duration and increase in EMG mean power frequency (MPF) drop rate on the affected side in the MTG. CONCLUSION: This study shows the moderate gait training intensity by avoiding muscular fatigue has better motor recovery for sub-acute stroke rehabilitation."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional brain imaging has shown that bilateral brain reorganization may occur after unilateral cerebral damage. The present study searched for evidence of bilateral motor control changes in gait in patients with chronic unilateral stroke. METHODS: Gait variables (temporal and spatial parameters, footprint peak times (FPPT) and footfall times (FFT)) were recorded in 48 patients with chronic unilateral stroke at their preferred speed, and in 10 healthy volunteers walking from very slowly to very fast on a pressure sensor walkway. The data were divided into 4 groups according to gait velocity. The functional outcome of stroke was measured by the Barthel Index. RESULTS: Patients' gait variables reflected their hemiparetic gait pattern. Slower patients had prolonged stance, FPPT and FFT on the non-affected side (NS), and prolonged swing and shorter FPPT and FFT on the affected side (AS). The magnitude of the asymmetry index of these parameters was inversely associated with velocity performance and, at the same time, it characterized how much the control of the clinically healthy (NS) side was altered during walking. Bilateral changes in kinetic and footfall variables in the chronic stage of unilateral stroke were present. CONCLUSIONS: Patients chose their preferred walking velocity using stereotyped, alternative gait patterns, in which the contribution of the NS was larger than that of the AS. Alternative gait patterns may partly demonstrate compensatory behavioral strategies adapted by patients."

                "abstract": "Monitoring the neural activities from the ischemic penumbra provides critical information on neurological recovery after stroke. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the temporal alterations of neural activities using electroencephalography (EEG) from the acute phase to the chronic phase, and to compare EEG with the degree of post-stroke motor function recovery in a rat model of focal ischemic stroke. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90\u00a0min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery followed by reperfusion for seven days (n = 58). The EEG signals were recorded at the pre-stroke phase (0\u00a0h), acute phase (3, 6\u00a0h), subacute phase (12, 24, 48, 72\u00a0h) and chronic phase (96, 120, 144, 168\u00a0h) (n = 8). This study analyzed post-stroke seizures and polymorphic delta activities (PDAs) and calculated quantitative EEG parameters such as the alpha-to-delta ratio (ADR). The ADR represented the ratio between alpha power and delta power, which indicated how fast the EEG activities were. Forelimb and hindlimb motor functions were measured by De Ryck's test and the beam walking test, respectively. In the acute phase, delta power increased fourfold with the occurrence of PDAs, and the histological staining showed that the infarct was limited to the striatum and secondary sensory cortex. In the subacute phase, the alpha power reduced to 50% of the baseline, and the infarct progressed to the forelimb cortical region. ADRs reduced from 0.23 \u00b1 0.09 to 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 at 3\u00a0h in the acute phase and gradually recovered to 0.22 \u00b1 0.08 at 168\u00a0h in the chronic phase. In the comparison of correlations between the EEG parameters and the limb motor function from the acute phase to the chronic phase, ADRs were found to have the highest correlation coefficients with the beam walking test (r = 0.9524, p < 0.05) and De Ryck's test (r = 0.8077, p < 0.05). This study measured EEG activities after focal cerebral ischemia and showed that functional recovery was closely correlated with the neural activities in the penumbra. Longitudinal EEG monitoring at different phases after a stroke can provide information on the neural activities, which are well correlated with the motor function recovery."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The absolute number of new stroke patients is annually increasing and there still remains only a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments with significant limitations available to patients. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is a promising potential therapeutic for ischemic stroke that has shown success in pre-clinical rodent studies but lead to inconsistent efficacy results in human patients. The physical properties of Tan-IIA, including short half-life and low solubility, suggests that Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle-assisted delivery may lead to improve bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. The objective of this study was to develop Tan IIA-loaded nanoparticles (Tan IIA-NPs) and to evaluate their therapeutic effects on cerebral pathological changes and consequent motor function deficits in a pig ischemic stroke model. RESULTS: Tan IIA-NP treated neural stem cells showed a reduction in SOD activity in in vitro assays demonstrating antioxidative effects. Ischemic stroke pigs treated with Tan IIA-NPs showed reduced hemispheric swelling when compared to vehicle only treated pigs (7.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.41 vs. 16.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62%), consequent midline shift (MLS) (1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 vs. 2.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0mm), and ischemic lesion volumes (9.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.06 vs. 12.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0cm3) when compared to vehicle-only treated pigs. Treatment also lead to lower reductions in diffusivity (-37.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.67 vs. -46.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73%) and white matter integrity (-19.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.58 vs. -30.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.19%) as well as reduced hemorrhage (0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15 vs 2.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.84\u00a0cm3) 24\u00a0h post-ischemic stroke. In addition, Tan IIA-NPs led to a reduced percentage of circulating band neutrophils at 12 (7.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.93 vs. 14.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.73%) and 24 (4.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48 vs 5.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85%) hours post-stroke suggesting a mitigated inflammatory response. Moreover, spatiotemporal gait deficits including cadence, cycle time, step time, swing percent of cycle, stride length, and changes in relative mean pressure were less severe post-stroke in Tan IIA-NP treated pigs relative to control pigs. CONCLUSION: The findings of this proof of concept study strongly suggest that administration of Tan IIA-NPs in the acute phase post-stroke mitigates neural injury likely through limiting free radical formation, thus leading to less severe gait deficits in a translational pig ischemic stroke model. With stroke as one of the leading causes of functional disability in the United States, and gait deficits being a major component, these promising results suggest that acute Tan IIA-NP administration may improve functional outcomes and the quality of life of many future stroke patients."

In order to improve stroke outcome, novel treatment approaches as well as animal stroke models predictive for the clinical setting are of urgent need. One of the main obstacles in experimental stroke research is measuring long-term outcome, in particular in mouse models of stroke. On the other hand, assessing functional deficits in animal models of stroke is critical to improve the prediction of preclinical findings. Automated gait analysis provides a sensitive tool to examine locomotion and limb coordination in small rodents. Comparing mice before and 10 days after experimental stroke (60 min MCAo) we observed a significant decrease in maximum contact area, stride length and swing speed in the hind limbs, especially the contralateral one. Mice showed a disturbed interlimb coordination represented by changes in regularity index and phase dispersion. To assess whether gait analysis is applicable to assess improvements by neuroprotective compounds, we applied a model calculation and approached common statistical problems. In conclusion, gait analysis is a promising tool to assess mid- to long-term outcome in experimental stroke research."

To date, thorough analysis of gait changes in animal models of TBI to allow for correlation of pathological alterations and utilization of this as a therapeutic outcome have been limited. We therefore assessed gait using the DigiGait analysis system as well as overall locomotion using the Beam Walk test in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats following a commonly used model of TBI, parietal lobe controlled cortical impact (CCI). Rats underwent DigiGait baseline analysis 24\u2009h prior to injury, followed by a moderate CCI in the left parietal lobe. Performance on the DigiGait was then assessed at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-injury, followed by histological analysis of brain tissue. Beam walk analysis showed a transient but significant impairment acutely after injury. Despite observance of gait disturbance in the clinical population, TBI in the parietal lobe of rats resulted in limited alterations in hind or forelimb function. General hindlimb locomotion showed significant but transient impairment. Significant changes in gait were observed to last through the sub-acute period, including right hindpaw angle of rotation and left forelimb and right hindlimb swing phase duration. Slight changes that did not reach statistical significant but may reflect subtle impacts of TBI on gait were reflected in several other measures, such as stride duration, stance duration and stance width. These results demonstrate that moderate-severe injury to the parietal cortex and underlying structures including corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia result in slight changes to gait that can be detected using the Digigait analysis system."

The changes being studied included fatigue effects, EMG burst duration in the gait cycle, and the symmetry of muscle activation between affected and unaffected sides. Intramuscular EMG of medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in male Sprague Dawley rats at affected side (n=10) and unaffected side (n=10) were recorded during the treadmill running before a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAo/r) surgery and poststroke recovery stage. Behavioral test score and bodyweight were recorded at a daily basis after stroke. The mean power frequency (MPF) of the EMG, EMG burst duration in the gait cycle, and symmetry index between two sides were used for analysis. The drop rate of MPF of MG at the unaffected side increased (P<0.05) at poststroke day 2 and it generally decreased along the poststroke training days and almost returned to baseline value at poststroke day 6. Symmetry index of MG and TA showed a large imbalance right after stroke and tended to return to normal. Our findings of the MPF drop after stroke might indicate fatigue effects due to the compensation loading share of the ipsilateral side muscle and the increase of the symmetry index reflects abnormal gait pattern after the onset of stroke. The recovery rate after stroke could be investigated with EMG parameters together with the behavioral score, and both were improved during and after the BWS treadmill training."

Three days after CCI, intensity, area or width of paw contact were significantly decreased in forepaw(s) while the relative paw placement between the fore and hindpaws altered, suggesting that TBI affected sensorimotor status and reduced interlimb coordination. Similar to TBI patients, CCI decreased gait velocity and stride length, and prolonged stance and swing phase in mice. Following CCI, step pattern was also changed with increasing use in the ipsilateral-diagonal limb sequence. Our results indicate that gait analysis provides great insight into both spatial and temporal aspects of limb function changes during overground locomotion in quadruped species with head injury that are valuable for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation.

To determine the effect of stroke on gait function in adult rats with distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we assessed the longitudinal changes in gait using an automated computer-assisted gait analysis system. Four days after MCAO, intensity, maximal area of contact, and paw angle were significantly decreased in the affected forepaw whereas the double support time using ipsilateral paws increased. Relative print positions between the fore and hindpaws and limb coupling were also altered, suggesting that stroke affected sensorimotor status and reduced limb coordination. Except for paw angle, these impairments persisted for at least 5 weeks. However, unlike human stroke patients, stride length and stance were not affected in rats with MCAO. Environmental enrichment for 4 weeks improved paw contact area and relative print position of the affected limb and reduced double support time in ischemic rats compared with controls. Our results indicate that gait analysis provides great insight into various aspects of motor function changes in ischemic quadrupeds, and that environmental enrichment is beneficial in reducing a variety of poststroke gait impairments possibly through enhanced structural plasticity mechanisms within injured cortical neuronal networks underlying locomotor function."

In addition, most of these studies do not use lesion etiology or affected cerebral hemisphere as study factors. However, it is unknown whether these factors are associated with post-stroke motor performance after the spontaneous recovery period. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether time since stroke onset, etiology, and lesion side is associated with spatiotemporal and angular gait parameters of individuals with chronic stroke. METHODS: Fifty individuals with chronic hemiparesis (20 women) were evaluated. The sample was stratified according to time since stroke (between 6 and 12 months, between 13 and 36 months, and over 36 months), affected cerebral hemisphere (left or right) and lesion etiology (ischemic and hemorrhagic). The participants were evaluated during overground walking at self-selected gait speed, and spatiotemporal and angular gait parameters were calculated. Results Differences between gait speed, stride length, hip flexion, and knee flexion were observed in subgroups stratified based on lesion etiology. Survivors of a hemorrhagic stroke exhibited more severe gait impairment. Subgroups stratified based on time since stroke only showed intergroup differences for stride length, and subgroups stratified based on affected cerebral hemisphere displayed between-group differences for swing time symmetry ratio. CONCLUSION: In order to recruit a more homogeneous sample, more accurate results were obtained and an appropriate rehabilitation program was offered, researchers and clinicians should consider that gait pattern might be associated with time since stroke, affected cerebral hemisphere and lesion etiology."

Freeze-dried allergen powder suspensions of pigeon droppings were used to establish 2 rat models of HP, one by aerosol inhalation and one by airway instillation, and the rats were sacrificed after different lengths of time to observe the pathological changes in their lung tissues. RESULTS: By the 40th week after allergen inhalation, granulomas were the main changes in the model, without fibrotic changes. When using airway instillation to establish the model, at the 20th week, group 1 (low dose + twice/week) and group 2 (medium dose + twice/week) showed granuloma changes, but no fibrosis; group 3 (high dose + once/week) and group 4 (high dose + twice/week) both showed obvious pulmonary fibrotic changes, but the death rate of rats in group 4 was greater. CONCLUSIONS: Both aerosol inhalation and airway instillation of freeze-dried pigeon allergen powder can successfully establish an HP model. The airway instillation method can cause pulmonary fibrotic changes in a short time, and the pulmonary pathological changes of animal models manifest with an obvious time-dose effect."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) remains a diagnostic challenge. The process of collecting and extracting serum and droppings from causative animals for the inhalation challenge test is complicated and the risk of inducing disease progression exists. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility and safety of an inhalation challenge test using pigeon eggs. METHODS: Pigeon eggs were pasteurized and mixed with a saline solution to produce an inhalation fluid. An inhalation challenge test was conducted on 19 patients with bird-related CHP and 17 patients with interstitial lung disease other than bird-related CHP. To identify antigens in pigeon eggs, the antigen-antibody responses of the pigeon eggs and serum from patients were evaluated using Western blotting. RESULTS: The mean changes in C-reactive protein, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase significantly increased by 0.32\u00a0mg/dL (P\u00a0=\u00a0.014), 7.8\u00a0Torr (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), 1.4\u00a0mm/h (P\u00a0=\u00a0.012), and 5.4 U/mL (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0019), respectively, in bird-related CHP group compared to the control 24\u00a0hours after the inhalation challenge test. Furthermore, within 24\u00a0hours of the inhalation test, the mean forced vital capacity decreased by 2.3% in the bird-related CHP group compared with a decline of 0.05% in the control group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.035). Serum collected from seven bird-related CHP patients who underwent the inhalation challenge test and reacted to antigens with molecular weights of 37-75 KDa, and these molecular weights were consistent with egg albumin and globulin. CONCLUSION: Since a mild response was observed after the inhalation challenge test using pigeon eggs, this test was an obvious candidate for diagnosing bird-related CHP."

The pathological features, consisting of alveolitis and interstitial granulomas, were similar to those reported previously in the experimental models. Repeated inhalation challenge of pigeon serum, however, did not develop chronic alveolitis but led to the fading of the disease. It was suggested that desensitization defined as the suppression of delayed hypersensitivity contributed to the mechanism of the fading of the disease. Repeated pigeon serum inhalation without previous immunization by the same antigen could produce a moderate interstitial pneumonitis but did not demonstrate a typical granulomatous histological change in lungs. It was necessary to use adjuvant for producing a complete animal model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Antigen-specific antibody response did not directly correlate with the development of the animal model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis."

Chemical analysis of this antigen was carried out employing column fractionation techniques. Sephadex G-50 and DEAE cellulose were performed and several proteins and hexoses peaks were recorded. Molecular weights were determined by comparison with standardized marker proteins passed through a drop counting fraction collector. The whole extract revealed a molecular weight of 100 Kd while fraction 1 showed 66 Kd and fraction 2 only 30 Kd. A guinea pig experimental model was developed with the whole extract injected by the intradermal route, administered by an intragastric catheter or aerosolized in a glass chamber. Histopathological studies were carried out with the lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen obtained by the necropsy of the animals. The lungs and the kidneys showed the paramount changes in their structures with lymphomononuclear infiltrates and an Arthus-like phenomenon surrounding the vessels. Immunological techniques were applied to the sera and the lymphocytes obtained from the animals. Precipitin and hemagglutinating IgG antibodies were detected against the whole extract and the fractions obtained by column fractionation. Sensitized lymphocytes were also detected. This experimental model represents a guide in the approach to the human allergic alveolitis whose immunological findings will be presented in a forth-coming report."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The accuracy of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G testing for diagnosis of stable bird-related fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is controversial. Furthermore, avian serum, extracts, or feathers were employed as antigens in bird-related HP; however, the usage of egg whites has not been reported. We investigated the utility of IgG testing against pigeon egg whites in patients with stable bird-related fibrotic HP. METHODS: Patients having a positive inhalation test for pigeon antigen and a histological investigation with diagnostic confidence of fibrotic HP greater than moderate confidence were included. The control group consisted of patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) other than HP. To select patients in the stable phase, patients with fibrotic HP were excluded if they were clinically considered to be in the acute exacerbation or acute phase. The IgG testing against pigeon egg whites by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the commercialized anti-pigeon IgG testing by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay were investigated. RESULTS: In this study, 37 patients with stable bird-related fibrotic HP and 32 patients with ILDs other than HP participated. Serum IgG testing for pigeon egg whites revealed that the control group's optical density was 0.147 and the group with bird-related fibrotic HP had a mean value of 0.207 (p = 0.011). IgG testing in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was not significantly higher in the bird-related fibrotic HP group than in controls (p = 0.42). No significant difference in area under the curve between an IgG testing against pigeon egg whites and a commercialized anti-pigeon IgG testing was observed (p = 0.24). Test accuracy for stable bird-related fibrotic HP ranged from 62% to 76% sensitivity and 59-66% specificity. CONCLUSION: IgG testing to identify the inciting antigen in patients with stable bird-related fibrotic HP had relatively low accuracy."

                "abstract": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immune mediated lung disease induced by the repeated inhalation of a wide variety of antigens. Bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (BRHP) is one of the most common forms of HP in human and results from the inhalation of avian antigens. The findings of a recent clinical analysis suggest that in addition to Th1 factors, the levels of interleukin(IL)-17 and IL-17-associated transcripts are increased in the setting of HP, and that both IL-17A and neutrophils are crucial for the development of pulmonary inflammation in murine models of HP. Our objectives were to investigate the roles of IL-17A and neutrophils in granuloma-forming inflammation in an acute HP model. We developed a mouse model of acute BRHP using pigeon dropping extract. We evaluated the process of granuloma formation and the roles of both IL-17A and neutrophils in a model. We found that the neutralization of IL-17A by the antibody attenuated granuloma formation and the recruitment of neutrophils, and also decreased the expression level of chemokine(C-X-C motif) ligand 5 (CXCL5) in the acute HP model. We confirmed that most of the neutrophils in the acute HP model exhibited immunoreactivity to the anti-IL-17 antibody. We have identified the central roles of both IL-17A and neutrophils in the pathogenesis of granuloma formation in acute HP. We have also assumed that neutrophils are an important source of IL-17A in an acute HP model, and that the IL-17A-CXCL5 pathway may be responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils. "

                "abstract": "Pigeon breeder's disease (PBD) is an interstitial lung disease induced by exposure to pigeon antigens. Search of antipigeon antigen antibodies (APSA) in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage is generally used for auxiliary diagnostic purposes. However, APSA can be present in a number of exposed but asymptomatic individuals as well as in patients with other interstitial lung diseases who live in areas where keeping pigeons is a common domestic habit. In this study, saliva was evaluated as an alternative means to serum for APSA detection by ELISA using pooled pigeon sera as antigen. Serum and saliva samples obtained from 17 patients with PBD, 14 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 19 asymptomatic relatives (AR) exposed to pigeon antigens, and 27 clinical healthy voluntary subjects (CHVS) were tested for IgG and IgA APSA. Our results showed that both fluids obtained from PBD patients exhibited a significantly higher specific IgG antibody activity compared to the other groups. Serum optical density (O.D.) values for PBD were 1.187 +/- 0.738 vs. 0.024 +/- 0.033, 0.255 +/- 0.471, and 0.204 +/- 0.346 for CHVS, AR and IPF, respectively (P < 0.05). Salivary O.D. for PBD were 0.801 +/- 0.447 vs 0.010 +/- 0.011, 0.104 +/- 0.151, and 0.22 +/- 0.447 (P < 0.05). In contrast, serum specific IgA did not discriminate between PBD and IPF patients. In addition, although the PBD group exhibited the highest values of IgA salivary APSA, high levels were also observed in saliva specimens from CHVS, a group of normal individuals who deny pigeon exposure. These findings suggest that measurement of IgG salivary APSA can play a role in the evaluation process of patients with pigeon breeder's disease."

Histological study is used to establish the diagnosis and to differentiate the disease from other respiratory disorders. This case report suggests that immunohistological demonstration of the causative antigen in the lung may be a useful diagnostic approach in cases of pigeon hypersensitivity pneumonitis. A 52 year-old woman was studied. She had a prior history of pigeon exposure, and lived in an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Her clinical presentation, respiratory function tests and imaging studies revealed a predominant interstitial lung disease. The results of antiavian antibodies, bronchoalveolar analysis, and other laboratory parameters were non-diagnostic. A lung biopsy showed a prominent granulomatous reaction with a sarcoid-like appearance in some areas, and an interstitial infiltration constituted by lymphocytes, plasma cells and foamy macrophages. Although the disease manifestations were compatible with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, we decided to study the causal antigen by immunohistochemistry. The use of a polyclonal antibody raised against pigeon serum showed a predominant cytoplasmic immunostaining in multinucleated giant cells and histiocytes from lung granulomas. Other respiratory disorders were reasonably excluded. Previous exposure to a known antigen may support the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Although the inhalation of organic dusts may be clinically evident, the aetiology is commonly evaluated by different challenge tests or immunological methods. We propose that the study of pigeon antigen by immunohistochemistry may be used as part of the diagnostic approach for hypersensitivity pneumonitis."

However, smoking rate in chronic pigeon breeder's lung (PBL) seemed to be high in our clinical experiences. We developed a murine model of PBL by intranasal instillation with pigeon dropping extracts (PDE) for 4 weeks (short-term exposure) and 17 weeks (long-term exposure) to investigate the effect of cigarette smoke on disease processes. In this model, lung inflammation associated with the production of anti-PDE antibodies and antigen dependent lymphocyte proliferation was induced. Long-term exposure to PDE without cigarette smoking resulted in an increase in lung weight/body weight ratio, total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and content of hydroxyproline in the lung compared to shortterm exposure. After a short-term exposure, cigarette smoke lessened the lymphocytosis in BAL fluid, and lymphocyte proliferation. On the other hand, after a long-term exposure cigarette smoke increased lung hydroxyproline. These results suggest that a short-term cigarette smoking attenuates lung inflammation, but a long-term cigarette smoking enhances lung inflammation with fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Avian antigen is a common cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Inhalation challenge with pigeon serum and pigeon dropping extract (PDE) elicits a hypersensitivity reaction in patients with bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (BRHP), but the antigenic components in these materials have yet to be fully elucidated. METHOD: Pigeon serum, pigeon intestine homogenates, and PDE were immunoblotted with serum samples from 8 patients with BRHP, 2 patients with summer-type HP, 2 patients with humidifier lung, and 3 healthy volunteers. Among the protein spots found in both pigeon serum and PDE, those that reacted with sera from BRHP patients were identified by mass spectrometry. Immunoassays using recombinant protein were performed to confirm the antigenicity of the identified protein. Cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with recombinant protein was also assessed. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide-1 (IGLL-1) was identified from all spots on 2-DE immunoblots of both pigeon serum and PDE. The BRHP patients exhibited higher levels of serum IgG antibody against the recombinant IGLL-1 (rIGLL-1) compared to the control subjects, as well as a stronger PBMCs proliferative response to rIGLL-1. Cytokine production by PBMCs from BRHP patients after rIGLL-1 exposure indicated that the protein could induce Th1 prone immune responses: an increase in TNF-\u03b1 and an absence of elevated IL-10 production. CONCLUSIONS: Pigeon IGLL-1 was identified as the BRHP antigen present in both pigeon serum and PDE."

For example, bird-related HP (BRHP) results from the inhalation of avian antigens. The clinical features of chronic HP, including imaging and histological findings, are similar to those of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Despite its status as the \"gold standard,\" the inhalation provocation test (IPT) is rarely performed, because the methods and the criteria are not standardized. In 2000, we reported the utility of IPT for pigeon dropping extracts. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current study was to validate the utility and safety of the test, and to differentiate chronic HP from other interstitial lung diseases. METHODS: A total of 28 patients with chronic BRHP and 19 control subjects were evaluated in this retrospective study. We validated the previous criteria and proposed new criteria using prediction scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the IPT using pigeon dropping extracts, the previous criteria showed a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specificity of 94.7% in this retrospective study. The increases in the peripheral white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels are good indicators of a positive response to the inhalation challenge. We propose the use of the IPT prediction score (\u2206WBC [%]\u2009+\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u2206P[a\u2009-\u2009a]O2 [mm Hg], where WBC is white blood cell) and the prediction rule, which showed high sensitivity and specificity values of 92.9 and 94.7%, respectively. Two (1.5%) out of a total of 130 subjects who underwent the tests required treatment after the challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The IPT is a useful and safe tool for the diagnosis of chronic HP. The IPT prediction score that we have proposed has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of chronic BRHP."

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize the responsible component of pigeon dropping extract (PDE) for PBD. METHODS: First, crude PDE was applied to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting by using antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Second, 9 bands of PDE were separated by SDS-PAGE and used for antigen-induced PBMCs. Finally, amino-terminal sequencing was conducted on an isolated 21-kd protein by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. RESULTS: Immunoblots with BAL fluid from patients with PBD identified 9 bands. Similar patterns were observed by using BAL fluid from 10 control patients (9 with summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 1 asymptomatic breeder), except for the 21-kd protein, which was detected in 10 patients with PBD and 1 asymptomatic breeder. The stimulation indices of PBMCs determined by using proteins electroeluted from the 9 bands were higher in patients with PBD than in the 10 control patients. The 21-kd protein was separated into 5 spots by 2-dimensional electrophoresis; these spots were all reactive with BAL fluid from patients with PBD as determined by immunoblotting. The sequence of the 21-kd protein had 57% identity to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome X reading frame. A synthetic peptide, derived from the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal of the native protein, induced significant proliferation of PBMCs obtained from 5 patients with PBD, but not with PBMCs obtained from control patients. CONCLUSION: The 21-kd protein is the only protein that identified individuals exposed to pigeons by immunoblotting. Only PBMCs from patients with PBD showed significant proliferation to the 21-kd protein and to the synthetic peptide on the basis of the N-terminal sequence of the native peptide. The 21-kd protein will be an important antigen for studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of PBD."

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) could be useful to discriminate pigeon HP from asymptomatic breeders (AB) and other interstitial lung diseases. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with pigeon HP, 47 AB, 31 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) group were studied. IgM RF was determined through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot using human IgG and IgG Fc fragment as antigens. IgG and IgA anti-avian antibodies (AA) against pigeon serum antigen were also measured. The use of F(ab')2 fraction of peroxidase-labelled anti-human immunoglobulins prevented endogenous interferences. Possible cross-binding of RF with avian antigens and the reactivity against human IgG by AA were studied. RESULTS: RF tests were frequently positive in HP (52.8%) in comparison to AB (4.2%) and IPF (12.9%; P = 2.6 x 10-10 and 4.1 x 10-5). Therefore, the presence of RF in pigeon HP showed a sensitivity of 52% and was highly specific considering the results of AB and IPF (95 and 87%, respectively). The RA group revealed positive RF but negative AA tests. RF activity was confirmed through western blot using purified IgG Fc fragment. Overlapping levels of IgG and IgA AA were found in HP and AB. The frequency of AA was low in IPF. The cross-reaction of RF with avian antigens was excluded, and no reactivity against human IgG by AA was detected. Other endogenous interferences were ruled out. CONCLUSION: No single immunological test may definitively distinguish pigeon HP from AB and other interstitial lung disorders; however, positive RF, together with high AA levels, seems to be useful in differentiating the diagnosis."

Total IgG, IgM and IgA in lavage fluid were determined as were specific antibody levels against antigens in pigeon serum and droppings. Results were converted to levels in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) using lavage and serum urea ratios. It was found that symptomatics represent a group that is hyperreactive to pigeon antigens compared with the asymptomatic group with significantly higher IgG, IgM, IgA levels as well as specific antibody levels against pigeon serum and droppings. Paired serum and ELF samples from 12 symptomatic subjects showed significantly elevated IgG, IgM and IgA levels in ELF compared with serum when values were expressed in terms of albumin. This strongly supports the concept of local production of immunoglobulins within the lung after inhaling immunogens as opposed to their diffusion from the vasculature. Results for IgA indicate that any putative protective role for this immunoglobulin is not valid in relation to the prevention of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. Analysis of smoking habits, lung immunoglobulins and response to inhalation challenge confirm the negative influence of smoking on total and functional lung immunoglobulins; however, levels in the ELF of ex-smokers suggest that the effect of smoking is not permanent. Smoking did not prevent responses to inhalation challenge."

In this study we analyzed the T-lymphocyte proliferative response to a variety of avian antigens with use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 patients who had PBD and 10 healthy volunteers. We used a new method based on avian antigen-bearing nitrocellulose particles derived from Western blots to study the T-cell proliferative response to 15 antigenic fractions obtained from pigeon serum. With this technique, complex mixtures of antigens can be fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and used for T-cell proliferation assays with selected antigenic determinants. A wide variety of responses were observed, and there were no reproducible patterns of reaction within either group. Nine of 10 healthy subjects responded to some soluble fractions. However, patients with PBD displayed the strongest response and responded to a significantly greater number of antigenic fractions. Fraction 2, representing a 220 kd molecular weight protein, was the only immunodominant antigen when both groups were compared; it was recognized by 73% of the patients with PBD and by only 20% of control subjects (p < 0.03). These findings show that T lymphocytes of patients with PBD recognize a wide range of bird proteins, which induce marked T-cell proliferation."

The insidious nature of this disease, as well as the importance of detailed environmental information in children with unexplained respiratory disease are emphasized. In this case, lung function tests showed a classic restrictive ventilatory defect, and a serious obstructive ventilatory defect evidenced in the narrowing of the smaller airways, and a reduction in the forced expiratory flow at small lung volumes. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a lung disease that results from sensitization by inhalation of a variety of organic dusts. Patients usually have circulating antibodies against the etiologic agents. Most patients with this disease also have sensitized T-cells to these agents. Long-term exposure can lead to irreversible lung disease. The histopathologic features are chronic interstitial and alveolar inflammation frequently accompanied by a granulomatous response. The most common symptomatic features are fever, chills and dyspnea 4 to 8 hours after exposure. Antibody activity to antigens is detected in the serum of both symptomatic and asymptomatic breeder's lung. Cellular hypersensitivity to antigens is demonstrated \"in vitro\" with peripheral lymphocyte populations in almost all symptomatic patients."

A rabbit antiserum made against the partially purified component revealed the presence of at least one other component that did not react with either symptomatic or asymptomatic sera.

However, recent findings suggest that this disease may present different pathologic patterns. In this study we evaluated the clinical behavior and survival of patients with pigeon breeder's disease according to the pathologic pattern. One-hundred ten biopsies were classified as \"typical\" (n = 58), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)-pattern (n = 22), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like (n = 10), mixed pattern (n = 9), organizing pneumonia (OP)-pattern (n = 3), airway-centered interstitial fibrosis (ACIF)-pattern (n = 3), and non-classified (n = 5). Clinical features and survival were compared between patients with \"typical\", NSIP, and UIP patterns. There were no statistical differences between the groups in age, gender, time of symptoms, smoking, clubbing, and PaO(2). By the one-way ANOVA test we found differences in the percent of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; p < 0.002) and in the forced vital capacity (p < 0.05) between the 3 groups. After Bonferroni correction the difference in BAL lymphocytes remained significant among the UIP-like and the typical pattern (36.1 \u00b1 22.9 versus 64.6 \u00b1 20.9, p = 0.001). UIP-like patients exhibited the worst survival rate (HR: 4.19; 95% CI: 1.66-14.47; p < 0.004) while NSIP-like pattern showed the best survival (HR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04-0.82; p < 0.03). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with a UIP-like pattern retained a significantly worse survival (HR: 3.4 (IC 95%: 1.15-10.29; p < 0.03), and mortality for the NSIP group was best and approached statistical significance (p = 0.07). These findings demonstrate that a variety of histopathologic and imaging patterns are seen in PBD, and the presence of a UIP-like pattern confers the worst prognosis."

The purpose of the current study was to examine Tan IIA's protective effects against silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and to explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that in vivo treatment with Tan IIA significantly relieved silica-induced lung fibrosis in a silicosis rat model by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Further, in vitro mechanistic investigations, mainly using western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, revealed that Tan IIA administration markedly inhibited the silica-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)/Smad signaling pathway and also reduced silica-induced oxidative stress and activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in A549 and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Furthermore, through transfection with siRNA, we demonstrate that Nrf2 activation partially mediates the suppression effects of Tan IIA on EMT and TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway activation induced by silica exposure, thus mediating the anti-fibrotic effects of Tan IIA against silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a hazardous occupational disease caused by inhalation of silica, characterized by persistent lung inflammation that leads to fibrosis and subsequent lung dysfunction. Moreover, the complex pathophysiology of silicosis, the challenges associated with early detection, and the unfavorable prognosis contribute to the limited availability of treatment options. Daphnetin (DAP), a natural lactone, has demonstrated various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and pulmonary protective effects. However, the effects of DAP on silicosis and its molecular mechanisms remain uncover. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DAP against pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis using a silica-induced silicosis mouse model, and investigate the potential mechanisms and targets through network pharmacology, proteomics, molecular docking, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Here, we found that DAP significantly alleviated silica-induced lung injury in mice with silicosis. The results of H&E staining, Masson staining, and Sirius red staining indicated that DAP effectively reduced the inflammatory response and collagen deposition over a 28-day period following lung exposure to silica. Furthermore, DAP reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells, increased the expression levels of Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in the mice with silicosis. More importantly, DAP suppressed the expression levels of NLRP3 signaling pathway-related proteins, including NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1, thereby inhibiting silica-induced lung inflammation. Further studies demonstrated that DAP possesses the ability to inhibit the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by silica through the inhibition of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. The experimental results of proteomic analysis found that the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway was the key targets of DAP to alleviate lung injury induced by silica. DAP significantly inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway induced by silica in lung tissues. The conclusion was also verified by the results of molecular and CETSA. To further verify this conclusion, the activity of PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway was inhibited in A549 cells using LY294002. When the A549 cells were pretreated with LY294002, the protective effect of DAP on silica-induced injury was lost. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that DAP alleviates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis induced by silica by modulating the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway, and holds promise as a potentially effective treatment for silicosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is characterized by pulmonary interstitial fibrosis that arises as a result of chronic exposure to silica. The few available treatments only delay its progression. As \u03b1-lipoic acid (ALA) has been shown to have various beneficial effects, including mitoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, we hypothesized that it may exhibit therapeutic effects in pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, in the present study, we used a murine model of silicosis to investigate whether supplementation with exogenous ALA could attenuate silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by improving mitochondrial function. ALA was administered to the model mice via continuous intragastric administration for 28 days, and then the antioxidant and mitoprotective effects of ALA were evaluated. The results showed that ALA decreased the production of reactive oxygen species, protected mitochondria from silica-induced dysfunction, and inhibited extracellular matrix deposition. ALA also decreased hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Activation of the mitochondrial AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 pathway might be responsible for these ALA-mediated anti-fibrotic effects. Exogenous ALA blocked oxidative stress by activating NRF2. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that exogenous ALA effectively prevents the progression of silicosis in a murine model, likely by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and endogenous antioxidant responses. Therefore, ALA can potentially delay the progression of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a systemic disease characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the lung tissue caused by long-term inhalation of large amounts of free silica (SiO2) dust. The pathogenesis of silicosis has not been fully elucidated, and there is a lack of effective treatment methods. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can potentially treat pulmonary fibrosis by exerting antioxidant effects. Desipramine (DMI) can influence pulmonary fibrosis development by inhibiting acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity and regulating ceramide concentrations. Both can interfere with pulmonary fibrosis through different mechanisms, but the intervention effects of NAC combined with DMI on silicosis fibrosis have not been reported. Therefore, this study established a rat silicosis model using a single tracheal drip of SiO2 dust suspension in Wistar rats to investigate the effect of NAC combined with DMI on SiO2 dust-induced silicosis and its related molecular mechanisms. The histopathological examination of the SiO2 dust-induced silicosis rats suggested that NAC and DMI alone or in combination could decrease the severity of pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The combined intervention had a better effect on reducing fibrosis than the individual interventions. NAC and DMI, alone or in combination, decreased the levels of markers related to pulmonary fibrosis in rats (smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagen (Col) I, Col III, hydroxyproline (HYP), inflammatory factors (transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)), and lipid peroxidase malondialdehyde (MDA)). The nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and ASMase/ceramide pathways were inhibited to some extent by increasing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels of antioxidant enzymes and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) levels of lipid peroxides. The combined intervention and NAC alone inhibited the SiO2 dust-induced elevation of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), but the effect was not significant in the DMI-treated group. Combining DMI and NAC inhibited Col I deposition and reduced HO-1, TIMP-1, and ASMase levels in lung tissues compared to individual treatments. In summary, the SiO2 dust could induce oxidative stress and inflammation in rats, resulting in an imbalance in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis/catabolism and ASMase/ceramide signaling pathway activation, leading to silicosis development.The combined intervention of DMI and NAC may synergistically regulate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, maintain the anabolic balance of the ECM, inhibit ASMase/ceramide signaling pathway activation by suppressing the inflammatory response and effectively delay silicosis fibrosis progression."

In this study, we explored the effects of administration (on the 28th day after silica exposure) of PolyG (MARCO inhibitor) on an established rat silicosis model. The lungs were analyzed histopathologically in rats using HE and Masson staining. The silica-induced ERS-related apoptosis, EMT and fibrosis were evaluated using western blotting, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. The results suggested that silica exposure could increase the MARCO activity, and induce ERS and EMT in lung tissues. Pharmacological targeting of MARCO with PolyG attenuated the development of pulmonary fibrosis in silica-exposed rats. Further study indicated that PolyG could inhibit silica-induced ERS-related apoptosis and EMT process. Together, our findings reveal an essential function of ERS-related apoptosis and EMT in the processes of pulmonary fibrosis caused by silica, and identify MARCO as a potential therapeutic pharmacological target for silicosis."

Results from histological examination indicated that emodin reduced the degree of alveolitis and fibrosis in the lungs of mice exposed to silica particles. We also demonstrated that emodin effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad3 and NF-\u03baB and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in the lung tissue of mice treated with silica particles. In addition, we found that emodin inhibited apoptosis and demonstrated an anti-fibrotic effect by down-regulating the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and up-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

Metformin, a commonly used biguanide antidiabetic agent, could activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to exert its pharmacological action. Therefore, we sought to investigate the role of metformin in silica-induced lung fibrosis. METHODS: The anti-fibrotic role of metformin was assessed in 50\u00a0mg/kg silica-induced lung fibrosis model. Silicon dioxide (SiO2)-stimulated lung epithelial cells/macrophages and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21)-induced differentiated lung fibroblasts were used for in vitro models. RESULTS: At the concentration of 300\u00a0mg/kg in the mouse model, metformin significantly reduced lung inflammation and fibrosis in SiO2-instilled mice at the early and late fibrotic stages. Besides, metformin (range 2-10\u00a0mM) reversed SiO2-induced cell toxicity, oxidative stress, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process in epithelial cells (A549 and HBE), inhibited inflammation response in macrophages (THP-1), and alleviated TGF-\u03b21-stimulated fibroblast activation in lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) via an AMPK-dependent pathway.

Inhalation of crystalline silica leads to persistent lung inflammation characterized by lung lesions due to granuloma formation. The specific molecular mechanism has not yet been identified, though.

Here, Curcumin, derived from Curcuma longa shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic molecule has been taken to investigate its therapeutic efficacy in silica-induced lung fibrosis. An experimental model of silicosis was established in mice where curcumin was administered an hour before intranasal silica exposure every alternate day for 35\u00a0days. Intranasal Curcumin treatment reduced silica-induced oxidative stress, inflammation marked by inflammatory cell recruitment, and prominent granuloma nodules along with aberrant collagen repair. Its protective benefits were confirmed by reduced MMP9 activities along with EMT markers (Vimentin and \u03b1-SMA). It has restored autophagy and suppressed the deposition of damaged mitochondria after silica exposure. Intranasal Curcumin also inhibited oxidative stress by boosting antioxidant enzyme activities and enhanced Nrf2-Keap1 expressions. Higher levels of PINK1, PARKIN, Cyt-c, P62/SQSTM, and damaged mitochondria in the silicosis group were significantly lowered after curcumin and dexamethasone treatments. Curcumin-induced autophagy resulted in reduced silica-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. We report that intranasal curcumin treatment showed protective properties on pathological features prompted by silica particles, suggesting that the compound may constitute a promising strategy for the treatment of silicosis in the near future."

Studies have suggested that Sim exerts anti-fibrotic effects by interfering fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. This study was to determine whether Sim could alleviate silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The rat model of silicosis was established by the tracheal perfusion method and treated with Sim (5 or 10\u00a0mg/kg), AICAR (an AMPK agonist), and apocynin (a NOX inhibitor) for 28 days. Lung tissues were collected for further analyses including pathological histology, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and the AMPK-NOX pathway. RESULTS: Sim significantly reduced silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis at 28 days after administration. Sim could reduce the levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 in lung tissues. The expressions of hydroxyproline, \u03b1-SMA and vimentin were down-regulated, while E-cad was increased in Sim-treated rats. In addition, NOX4, p22pox, p40phox, p-p47phox/p47phox expressions and ROS levels were all increased, whereas p-AMPK/AMPK was decreased in silica-induced rats. Sim or AICAR treatment could notably reverse the decrease of AMPK activity and increase of NOX activity induced by silica. Apocynin treatment exhibited similar protective effects to Sim, including down-regulating of oxidative stress and inhibition of the EMT process and inflammatory reactions.

                "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation play a fundamental role in the beginning and advancement of silicosis. Hence, questing active phytocompounds (APCs) with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties such as diosgenin (DG) and emodin (ED) can be a therapeutic intervention targeting silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Hydrophobicity and low bioavailability are the barriers that restrict the therapeutic efficacy of DG and ED against pulmonary defects. Encapsulating these APCs in polymeric nanoparticles can overcome this limitation. The present study has thus explored the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) individually loaded with DG (DGn) or ED (EDn) and in combine DG+ED [(DG+ED)n] in respirable silica dust (RSD)-induced pulmonary fibrosis silicosis rat model. Our study found that individual and combined NPs revealed physiochemical characteristics appropriate for IV administration with sustained-drug release purposes. Physiological evaluations of RSD-induced silicosis rats suggested that no treatment could improve the body weight. Still, they reduced the lung coefficient by maintaining lung moisture. Only (DG+ED)n significantly cleared free lung silica. All interventions were found to attribute the increased per cent cell viability in BALF, reduce cytotoxicity via minimizing LDH levels, and balance the oxidant-antioxidant status in silicotic rats. The expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, and TGF-\u03b21) were efficiently down-regulated with NPs interventions compared to pure (DG+ED) treatment. All drug treatments significantly declined, the 8-HdG and HYP productions indicate that RSD-induced oxidative DNA damage and collagen deposition were successfully repaired. Moreover, histopathological investigations proposed that individual or combined drugs NPs interventions could decrease the fibrosis and alveolitis grades in RSD-induced silicosis rats. However, (DG+ED)n intervention significantly inhibited pulmonary fibrosis and alveolitis compared to pure (DG+ED) treatment. In conclusion, the RSD can induce oxidative stress and inflammation in rats, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cytotoxicity to pulmonary cells and leading to silicosis development. The IV administration of combined NP suppressed lung inflammation and collagen formation by maintaining oxidant-antioxidant status and effectively interrupting the fibrosis-silicosis progression. These results may be attributed to the improved bioavailability of DG and ED through their combined nano-encapsulation-mediated targeted drug delivery."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is characterized by pulmonary fibrosis due to long-term inhalation of silica particles. Although the cause of this serious disease is known, its pathogenesis remains unclear and there are currently no specific treatments. Recent studies have shown that the anti-oxidant transcription factor Nrf2 is expressed at reduced levels in fibrotic foci, which may be related to disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which this might occur have yet to be elucidated. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS), an extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza, is used in traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of coronary heart disease. STS has been shown to play a strong anti-oxidative role in various organs. Here, we employed a rat model to explore the effects of STS on oxidative stress and the progression of fibrosis in silicosis. STS significantly reduced collagen deposition in the lungs, thereby antagonising silicosis. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining showed that Nrf2 was differentially expressed in lung cells during silica induced fibrosis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments demonstrated that Nrf2 promoted the expression of the antioxidant proteins thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Our results suggest that the anti-fibrotic effects of STS may be related to upregulation of Nrf2 nuclear expression, especially in fibrotic lesions, and the promotion of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase expression. Our findings may open up new avenues for the development of STS as a treatment for silicosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a kind of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis induced by the long-term inhalation of silica particles. The therapeutic strategy based on the microRNAs might be an effective way for the treatment of silicosis. Our previous miRNA microarray data indicated that miR-326 was decreased in the mouse lung tissues of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. However, the specific functions of miR-326 on silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. The objective was to determine the expression and the biological effects of miR-326 in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Methods included mouse models of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and miR-326 intervention that were established separately to explore the effect of miR-326 in vivo. The cell models of SiO2-treated lung epithelial cells (HBE and A549) and TGF-\u03b21-stimulated lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5 and NIH/3T3) were used to investigate the mechanism of miR-326 in vitro. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the severity and distribution of fibrosis of mouse lung tissues. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were performed to measure the downstream molecules of miR-326. Transmission electron microscopy pictures showed the autophagy activity. The results showed miR-326 is down-regulated in the fibrotic lung tissues of silica-treated mice, while increased expression of miR-326 attenuates silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily-14 (TNFSF14) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) are identified as the targets of miR-326. MiR-326 dampens pulmonary inflammation through targeting TNFSF14 and promotes autophagy activity of fibroblasts through targeting PTBP1. LncRNA HOTAIR facilitates inflammation via sponging miR-326. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-326 inhibits inflammation and promotes autophagy activity by targeting TNFSF14 and PTBP1 separately to alleviate silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our results might shed new light on the therapeutic strategies for silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is the most common type of pneumoconiosis, having a high incidence in workers chronically exposed to crystalline silica (CS). No specific medication exists for this condition. GHK, a tripeptide naturally occurring in human blood and urine, has antioxidant effects. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of GHK-Cu on silicosis and its potential underlying molecular mechanism. An experimental silicosis mouse model was established to observe the effects of GHK-Cu on lung inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, the effects of GHK-Cu on the alveolar macrophages (AM) were examined using the RAW264.7\u00a0cell line. Its molecular target, peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), has been identified, and GHK-Cu can bind to PRDX6, thus attenuating lung inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis mice without significant systemic toxicity. These effects were partly related to the inhibition of the CS-induced oxidative stress in AM induced by GHK-Cu. Thus, our results suggest that GHK-Cu acts as a potential drug by attenuating alveolar macrophage oxidative stress. This, in turn, attenuates the progression of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which provides a reference for the treatment of silicosis."

                "abstract": "Inhalation of crystalline silica particles leads to pulmonary fibrosis, eventually resulting in respiratory failure and death. There are few effective drugs that can delay the progression of this disease; thus, patients with silicosis are usually only offered supportive care. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, exhibits many biological activities and health benefits including its protective effects against hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of dioscin on silicosis is unknown. METHODS: We employed experimental mouse mode of silicosis. Different doses of dioscin were gavaged to the animals 1 day after crystalline silica instillation to see the effect of dioscin on crystalline silica induced pulmonary fibrosis. Also, we used RAW264.7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines to explore dioscin effects on macrophages and fibroblasts. Dioscin was also oral treatment but 10 days after crystalline silica instillation to see its effect on established pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: Dioscin treatment reduced pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It also reduced the recruitment of fibrocytes, protected epithelial cells from crystalline silica injury, inhibited transforming growth factor beta/Smad3 signaling and fibroblast activation. Together, these effects delayed the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism by which dioscin treatment alleviated CS-induced inflammation appeared to be via the reduction of macrophage, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocte infiltration into lung. Dioscin inhibits macrophages and fibroblasts from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and may also function as a modulator of T helper cells responses, concurrent with attenuated phosphorylation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Also, dioscin could block the phosphorylation of Smad3 in fibroblast. Oral treatment of dioscin could also effectively postpone the progression of established silicosis. CONCLUSION: Oral treatment dioscin delays crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and exerts pulmonary protective effects in mice. Dioscin may be a novel and potent candidate for protection against crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious lung problem with advancing and diffusive pulmonary fibrosis as the pathologic basis, and with oxidative stress and inflammation as the key pathogenesis. Glycyl-L-histidyl-l-lysine (GHK) is a tripeptide participating into wound healing and regeneration. GHK-Cu complexes improve GHK bioavailability. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the therapeutic role of GHK-Cu on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model. METHODS: BLM (3 mg/kg) was administered via tracheal instillation (TI) to induce a pulmonary fibrosis model in C57BL/6j mice 21\u00a0days after the challenge of BLM. GHK-Cu was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at different dosage of 0.2, 2 and 20\u00a0\u03bcg/g/day in 0.5\u00a0ml PBS on alternate day. The histological changes, inflammation response, the collagen deposition and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated in the lung tissue. EMT was evaluated by \u0251-SMA and fibronectin expression in the lung tissue. NF-\u03baB p65, Nrf2 and TGF\u03b21/Smad2/3 signalling pathways were detected by immunoblotting analysis. RESULTS: GHK-Cu complex inhibited BLM-induced inflammatory and fibrotic pathological changes, alleviated the inflammatory response in the BALF by reducing the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u0251 and IL-6 and the activity of MPO as well as reduced collagen deposition. In addition, the GHK-Cu treatment significantly reversed the MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance and partially prevented EMT via Nrf2, NF-\u03baB and TGF\u03b21 pathways, as well as Smad2/3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: GHK-Cu presented a protective effect in BLM-induced inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting EMT progression and suppressing TGF\u03b21/Smad2/3 signalling in pulmonary fibrosis."

The aim was to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of H2 on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. \u2022 What are the main findings and its importance? Our results indicate that, in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, H2 inhalation attenuated oxidative stress and reversed the pulmonary epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process by reducing reactive oxygen species production and inhibiting the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and collagen\u00a0I to improve fibrotic injury and exert anti-fibrogenic effects. Thus, H2 inhalation has promising therapeutic potential as a useful adjuvant treatment for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which deserves further study and evaluation. ABSTRACT: Hydrogen (H2 ) can protect against tissue damage. The effect of H2 inhalation therapy on the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis remains unknown. This study was designed to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of H2 inhalation on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. A rat model of pulmonary fibrosis was established with BLM. Rats were randomly divided into control and H2 inhalation groups. Haematoxylin and Eosin staining and Mason's Trichrome staining were performed to evaluate pulmonary fibrosis injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, structural disorder and collagen deposition. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to determine the expression of TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21, \u03b1-SMA, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, VEGF and collagen type\u00a0I at both mRNA and protein levels. The contents of reactive oxygen species, TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde and hydroxyproline were determined with biochemical test kits or ELISA kits. Bleomycin-stimulated rats exhibited typical symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, which featured an increase in collagen deposition, alveolitis, fibrosis and parenchymal structural disorder in the lung. However, BLM-induced oxidative stress was attenuated by H2 inhalation therapy, which reduced the contents of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and hydroxyproline, enhanced the activity of glutathione peroxidase and decreased the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u03b1. In addition, H2 inhalation also inhibited BLM-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting TGF-\u03b21, increasing the expression level of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin, and decreasing the expression level of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin in a time-dependent manner. In addition, H2 inhalation downregulated \u03b1-SMA expression and suppressed collagen\u00a0I generation, exerting anti-fibrogenic effects. Hydrogen inhalation therapy attenuates BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-\u03b21, relevant oxidative stress and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition."

In this study, up-regulating lncRNA MSTRG91634.7 restricted SiO2-activated EMT and restored mitochondrial homeostasis binding to PINK1 in vitro. Moreover, overexpressing PINK1 could inhibit SiO2-activated EMT in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice. Meanwhile, PINK1 contributed to restoring the SiO2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in mice lung. Our results revealed that exosomal lncRNA MSTRG.91634.7 from macrophages could restore mitochondrial homeostasis to restrict the SiO2-activated EMT by binding to PINK1 during pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis due to SiO2 exposure."

The purpose of study was to evaluate, in an already-assessed model of lung injury caused by bleomycin (BLM) administration, the role of resveratrol and quercetin, as well as to explore the potential beneficial properties of a mango leaf extract, rich in mangiferin, and a grape leaf extract, rich in dihydroquercetin (DHQ), on the same model. Mice were subjected to intra-tracheal administration of BLM, and polyphenols were administered by oral route immediately after BLM instillation and daily for 7 d. Treatment with resveratrol, mangiferin, quercetin and DHQ inhibited oedema formation and body weight loss, as well as ameliorated polymorphonuclear infiltration into the lung tissue and reduced the number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, polyphenols suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and prevented oxidative and nitroxidative lung injury, as shown by the reduced nitrotyrosine and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase levels. The degree of apoptosis, as evaluated by Bid and Bcl-2 balance, was also suppressed after polyphenol treatment. Finally, these natural products down-regulated cyclo-oxygenase-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylated expression and reduced NF-\u03baBp65 translocation. Our findings confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol and quercetin in BLM-induced lung damage, and highlight, for the first time, the protective properties of exogenous administration of mangiferin and DHQ on experimental pulmonary fibrosis.

Different doses of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were gavaged to the mice after CS instillation to observe the effect of NAC on CS induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. The pulmonary injury was evaluated with Hematoxylin and eosin/Masson staining. Reactive oxygen species level was analyzed by DCFH-DA labeling. Commercial ELISA kits were used to determine antioxidant activity (T-AOC, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, and IL-6). The expression of oxidising enzymes (NOX2, iNOS, SOD2, and XO) were detected by real time PCR. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed to examine epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers. The mice treated with NAC presented markedly reduced CS-induced pulmonary injury and ameliorated CS-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. The level of malondialdehyde was reduced, while the activities of GSH-PX, SOD, and T-AOC were markedly enhanced by NAC. We also found the down-regulation of oxidising enzymes (NOX2, iNOS, SOD2, and XO) after NAC treatment. Moreover, E-cadherin expression was increased while vimentin and Cytochrome C expressions were decreased by NAC. These encouraging findings suggest that NAC exerts pulmonary protective effects in CS-induced pulmonary fibrosis and might be considered as a promising agent for the treatment of silicosis."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silicosis presents a significant clinical challenges and economic burdens, with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emerging as a potential therapeutic avenue. However, the precise effects and mechanisms of TCM in treating silicosis remain uncertain and subject to debate. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to elucidate the therapeutic role and mechanisms of the Yang-Yin-Qing-Fei Decoction (YYQFD) and its key component, paeoniflorin, in silicosis using a murine model. METHODS: Silicotic mice were treated with YYQFD, pirfenidone (PFD), or paeoniflorin. RAW264.7 cells and mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) were stimulated with silica, matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12), or TGF-\u03b21, followed by treatment with paeoniflorin, PFD, or relevant inhibitors. YYQFD constituents were characterized using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Lung fibrosis severity was assessed via histopathological examination, micro-CT imaging, lung functions, and Western blot analysis. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were employed to delineate the gene expression profile and target genes modulated by YYQFD in silicosis. RESULTS: Treatment with YYQFD ameliorated silica-induced lung fibrosis. Transcriptome sequencing identified MMP-12 as a potential common target of YYQFD and PFD. Additionally, a potential pro-inflammatory role of MMP-12, regulated by silica-induced TLR4 signaling pathways, was revealed. Paeoniflorin, one of the most distinctive compounds in YYQFD, attenuated silica-induced MMP-12 increase and its derived inflammatory factors in macrophages through a direct binding effect. Notably, paeoniflorin treatment exerted anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting MMP-12-derived inflammatory factors and TGF-\u03b21-induced myofibroblast differentiation in silica-exposed mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores paeoniflorin as one of the most principal bioactive compounds in YYQFD, highlighting its capacity to attenuate lung inflammation driven by macrophage-derived MMP-12 and reduce lung fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silicosis is an irreversible fibrotic disease of the lung caused by chronic exposure to silica dust, which manifests as infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pulmonary diffuse fibrosis. As the disease progresses, lung function further deteriorates, leading to poorer quality of life of patients. Currently, few effective drugs are available for the treatment of silicosis. Bicyclol (BIC) is a compound widely employed to treat chronic viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury. While recent studies have demonstrated anti-fibrosis effects of BIC on multiple organs, including liver, lung, and kidney, its therapeutic benefit against silicosis remains unclear. In this study, we established a rat model of silicosis, with the aim of evaluating the potential therapeutic effects of BIC. METHODS: We constructed a silicotic rat model and administered BIC after injury. The FlexiVent instrument with a forced oscillation system was used to detect the pulmonary function of rats. HE and Masson staining were used to assess the effect of BIC on silica-induced rats. Macrophages-inflammatory model of RAW264.7 cells, fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (FMT) model of NIH-3T3 cells, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model of TC-1 cells were established in vitro. And the levels of inflammatory mediators and fibrosis-related proteins were evaluated in vivo and in vitro after BIC treatment by Western Blot analysis, RT-PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry experiments. RESULTS: BIC significantly improved static compliance of lung and expiratory and inspiratory capacity of silica-induced rats. Moreover, BIC reduced number of inflammatory cells and cytokines as well as collagen deposition in lungs, leading to delayed fibrosis progression in the silicosis rat model. Further exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that BIC suppressed the activation, polarization, and apoptosis of RAW264.7 macrophages induced by SiO2. Additionally, BIC inhibited SiO2-mediated secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b21 in macrophages. BIC inhibited FMT of NIH-3T3 as well as EMT of TC-1 in the in vitro silicosis model, resulting in reduced proliferation and migration capability of NIH-3T3 cells. Further investigation of the cytokines secreted by macrophages revealed suppression of both FMT and EMT by BIC through targeting of TGF-\u03b21. Notably, BIC blocked the activation of JAK2/STAT3 in NIH-3T3 cells required for FMT while preventing both phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2/3 in TC-1 cells necessary for the EMT process. CONCLUSION: The collective data suggest that BIC prevents both FMT and EMT processes, in turn, reducing aberrant collagen deposition. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that BIC ameliorates inflammatory cytokine secretion, in particular, TGF-\u03b21, and consequently inhibits FMT and EMT via TGF-\u03b21 canonical and non-canonical pathways, ultimately resulting in reduction of aberrant collagen deposition and slower progression of silicosis, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic agent."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a hazardous occupational disease caused by inhalation of silica, characterized by persistent lung inflammation that leads to fibrosis and subsequent lung dysfunction. Moreover, the complex pathophysiology of silicosis, the challenges associated with early detection, and the unfavorable prognosis contribute to the limited availability of treatment options. Daphnetin (DAP), a natural lactone, has demonstrated various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and pulmonary protective effects. However, the effects of DAP on silicosis and its molecular mechanisms remain uncover. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DAP against pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis using a silica-induced silicosis mouse model, and investigate the potential mechanisms and targets through network pharmacology, proteomics, molecular docking, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Here, we found that DAP significantly alleviated silica-induced lung injury in mice with silicosis. The results of H&E staining, Masson staining, and Sirius red staining indicated that DAP effectively reduced the inflammatory response and collagen deposition over a 28-day period following lung exposure to silica. Furthermore, DAP reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells, increased the expression levels of Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in the mice with silicosis. More importantly, DAP suppressed the expression levels of NLRP3 signaling pathway-related proteins, including NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1, thereby inhibiting silica-induced lung inflammation. Further studies demonstrated that DAP possesses the ability to inhibit the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by silica through the inhibition of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. The experimental results of proteomic analysis found that the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway was the key targets of DAP to alleviate lung injury induced by silica. DAP significantly inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway induced by silica in lung tissues. The conclusion was also verified by the results of molecular and CETSA. To further verify this conclusion, the activity of PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway was inhibited in A549 cells using LY294002. When the A549 cells were pretreated with LY294002, the protective effect of DAP on silica-induced injury was lost. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that DAP alleviates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis induced by silica by modulating the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway, and holds promise as a potentially effective treatment for silicosis."

                "abstract": "AIMS: Silicosis is the most common and severe type of pneumoconiosis, imposing a substantial disease burden and economic loss on patients and society. The pathogenesis and key targets of silicosis are not yet clear, and there are currently no effective treatments available. Therefore, we conducted research on mefunidone (MFD), a novel antifibrotic drug, to explore its efficacy and mechanism of action in murine silicosis. METHODS: Acute 7-day and chronic 28-day silicosis models were constructed in C57BL/6J mice by the intratracheal instillation of silica and subsequently treated with MFD to assess its therapeutic potential. The effects of MFD on silica-induced inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis were further investigated using immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs). RESULTS: In the 7-day silica-exposed mouse models, MFD treatment significantly alleviated pulmonary inflammation and notably reduced macrophage infiltration into the lung tissue. RNA-sequencing analysis of silica-induced iBMDMs followed by gene set enrichment analysis revealed that MFD profoundly influenced cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, chemokine signaling, and the toll-like receptor signaling pathways. MFD treatment also markedly reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from silica-exposed iBMDMs. Moreover, MFD effectively downregulated the activation of the TLR4-NF-\u03baB/MAPK signaling pathway induced by silica and mitigated the upregulation of pyroptosis markers. Additionally, MFD treatment significantly suppressed the activation of fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells co-cultured with silica-exposed mouse macrophages. Ultimately, in the 28-day silica-exposed mouse models, MFD administration led to a substantial reduction in the severity of pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSION: MFD mitigates silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice by suppressing the TLR4-NF-\u03baB/MAPK signaling pathway and reducing pyroptotic responses in macrophages. MFD could potentially emerge as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of silicosis."

These genes were primarily associated with key pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) signaling pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed the binding of TET to AKT1, the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and KDR. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TET significantly alleviated silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and reduced the expression of fibrotic markers. Moreover, TET exhibited inhibitory effects on the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of TGF-\u03b21-induced lung fibroblasts in vitro. Notably, TET mitigated silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing the PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TET possesses the ability to suppress silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of TET in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and silicosis."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silicosis is a systemic disease characterized by extensive fibrosis due to prolonged exposure to silica dust, with rising incidence rates significantly impacting global public health. ShengXian and JinShuiLiuJun Decoction (SXD) is a Chinese medicinal preparation containing a variety of medicinal plants. It has shown notable clinical efficacy in treating silicotic fibrosis in China. However, the precise mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain unclear. This study integrates network pharmacology, multi-omics analysis, and experimental validation to investigate the potential mechanisms by which SXD treats silicotic fibrosis. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of SXD in treating silicotic fibrosis and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: HPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to identify the active components of SXD, and combined with network pharmacology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, the mechanism of SXD in treating silicotic fibrosis was explored from multiple perspectives. The therapeutic effect of SXD was assessed through HE staining, Masson staining, Micro CT imaging, pulmonary function tests, and hydroxyproline content in lung tissue. Finally, network pharmacology and multi-omics findings were validated using molecular docking. CETSA, immunofluorescence, SPR, and Western blotting were used to analyze key factors in the NF-\u03baB pathway at the animal, cellular, and molecular levels. RESULTS: SXD treatment improved lung function in silicosis rats, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition, fibrosis and other pathological changes, and inhibited the protein expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A, and IL-1\u03b2, and NF-\u03baB in lung tissue. HPLC-Q-TOF-MS combined with network pharmacology identified key compounds such as Liquiritigenin, 3-Methoxynobiletin, Isomangiferin, Hesperidin, shogaol, and Ligustroflavone, which likely exert therapeutic effects through the TNF, IL-17, NF-\u03baB, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways. Transcriptomics and metabolomics results revealed that SXD up-regulated the expression of NF-\u03baB pathway-related genes (NFKBIA, NFKBIZ) and key regulators of the retinol metabolism pathway, while down-regulating pro-inflammatory genes (IL1B, IL17A, IL6). Experimental findings confirmed that SXD suppressed the expression of NF-\u03baB pathway-related proteins and upstream activators TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A, and IL-1\u03b2, as well as their receptors, in both lung tissue and cellular models. Additionally, SXD-containing serum had a direct, non-toxic effect on MRC-5\u00a0cells, effectively inhibiting collagen expression and TGF-\u03b2 secretion. SXD also had a positive effect on collagen production and extracellular matrix (ECM) aggregation in fibroblasts. Molecular dynamics studies showed that SXD directly binds to NF-\u03baB and I\u03baB. CONCLUSION: SXD exerts therapeutic effects on silicotic fibrosis by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling transduction mediated by TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A, and IL-1\u03b2, and suppressing fibroblast activation."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silicosis represents a paramount occupational health hazard globally, with its incidence, morbidity, and mortality on an upward trajectory, posing substantial clinical dilemmas due to limited effective treatment options available. Trigonelline (Trig), a plant alkaloid extracted mainly from coffee and fenugreek, have diverse biological properties such as protecting dermal fibroblasts against ultraviolet radiation and has the potential to inhibit collagen synthesis. However, it's unclear whether Trig inhibits fibroblast activation to attenuate silicosis-induced pulmonary fibrosis is unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Trig in the context of silicosis-related pulmonary fibrosis, a mouse model of silicosis was utilized. The investigation seeks to elucidated Trig's impact on the progression of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by evaluating protein expression, mRNA levels and employing Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome, and Sirius Red staining. Subsequently, we explored the mechanism underlying of its functions. RESULTS: In vivo experiment, Trig has been demonstrated the significant efficacy in mitigating SiO2-induced silicosis and BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as evidenced by improved histochemical staining and reduced fibrotic marker expressions. Additionally, we showed that the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblast was imped in Trig\u2009+\u2009SiO2 group. In terms of mechanism, we obtained in vitro evidence that Trig inhibited fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation by repressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling according to the in vitro evidence. Notably, our finding indicated that Trig seemed to be safe in mice and fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: In summary, Trig attenuated the severity of silicosis-related pulmonary fibrosis by alleviating the differentiation of myofibroblasts, indicating the development of novel therapeutic approaches for silicosis fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a global occupational disease characterized by lung dysfunction, pulmonary inflammation, and fibrosis, for which there is a lack of effective drugs. Pirfenidone has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties in the lung. However, whether and how pirfenidone is effective against silicosis remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of pirfenidone in the treatment of early and advanced silicosis in an experimental mouse model and explored its potential pharmacological mechanisms. We found that pirfenidone alleviated silica-induced lung dysfunction, secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) and deposition of fibrotic proteins (collagen I and fibronectin) in both early and advanced silicosis models. Moreover, we observed that both 100 and 200\u2009mg/kg pirfenidone can effectively treat early-stage silicosis, while 400\u2009mg/kg was recommended for advanced silicosis. Mechanistically, antibody array and bioinformatic analysis showed that the pathways related to IL-17 secretion, including JAK-STAT pathway, Th17 differentiation, and IL-17 pathway, might be involved in the treatment of silicosis by pirfenidone. Further in vivo experiments confirmed that pirfenidone reduced the production of IL-17A induced by silica exposure via inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation. Neutralizing IL-17A by anti-IL-17A antibody improved lung function and reduced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis animals. Collectively, our study has demonstrated that pirfenidone effectively ameliorated silica-induced lung dysfunction, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models by inhibiting the secretion of IL-17A."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a kind of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis induced by the long-term inhalation of silica particles. The therapeutic strategy based on the microRNAs might be an effective way for the treatment of silicosis. Our previous miRNA microarray data indicated that miR-326 was decreased in the mouse lung tissues of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. However, the specific functions of miR-326 on silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. The objective was to determine the expression and the biological effects of miR-326 in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Methods included mouse models of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and miR-326 intervention that were established separately to explore the effect of miR-326 in vivo. The cell models of SiO2-treated lung epithelial cells (HBE and A549) and TGF-\u03b21-stimulated lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5 and NIH/3T3) were used to investigate the mechanism of miR-326 in vitro. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the severity and distribution of fibrosis of mouse lung tissues. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were performed to measure the downstream molecules of miR-326. Transmission electron microscopy pictures showed the autophagy activity. The results showed miR-326 is down-regulated in the fibrotic lung tissues of silica-treated mice, while increased expression of miR-326 attenuates silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Tumor necrosis factor superfamily-14 (TNFSF14) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) are identified as the targets of miR-326. MiR-326 dampens pulmonary inflammation through targeting TNFSF14 and promotes autophagy activity of fibroblasts through targeting PTBP1. LncRNA HOTAIR facilitates inflammation via sponging miR-326. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-326 inhibits inflammation and promotes autophagy activity by targeting TNFSF14 and PTBP1 separately to alleviate silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our results might shed new light on the therapeutic strategies for silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a progressive inflammatory disease with poorly defined mechanisms and limited therapeutic options. Recent studies found that microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) were involved in the development of respiratory diseases; however, the function of non-coding RNAs in silicosis was still needed to be further explored. We found that miR-223-3p was significantly decreased in macrophages and lung tissues of mice after silica treatment, which were consistent with the results of GEO database microarray analysis. Notably, NLRP3 is a target gene downstream of miR-223-3p. And circular RNA PWWP2A (circPWWP2A) was significantly elevated after silica stimulation. To elucidate the role of these RNAs in silica-induced inflammation in macrophages and lung tissues, we investigated the upstream molecular mechanisms of circPWWP2A on the inflammatory response. The inhibitory effect of miR-223-3p on its target NLRP3 was suppressed by circPWWP2A, which led to lung fibrosis. Our study found that circPWWP2A could adsorb miR-223-3p to regulate NLRP3 after silica stimulation in pulmonary fibrosis. And our results revealed that the circPWWP2A-miR-223-3p-NLRP3 axis was potentially instrumental in managing silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-EVs) exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in multiple organs. However, the potential effectiveness of hucMSC-EVs against silicosis or the underlying mechanisms of their biological outcomes remains unclear. Therefore, we used 3D culture technology to extract hucMSC-EVs and observed their effects in macrophages and lung tissues, respectively. According to the EVmiRNA database, miR-223-3p was abundant in MSC-EVs. In addition, hucMSC-EVs may modulate lung function, reduce the secretion of inflammatory factors (NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and cleaved Caspase-1) and attenuate the deposition of fibrosis-related factors (Collagen \u2160, Collagen \u2162, fibronectin and \u03b1-SMA). In vitro results evinced that hucMSC-EVs reduced the inflammatory response of macrophages and restricted the activation and proliferation of fibroblasts. Moreover, our study showed that hucMSCs-EVs acted as a mediator to transfer miR-223-3p to suppress circPWWP2A, thereby alleviating pulmonary fibrosis through the NLRP3 signaling pathway. These data may provide potentially novel strategies for investigating the pathogenesis of silicosis and developing novel treatments for this disease."

Regrettably, no therapy currently can effectively reverse the silica-induced fibrotic lesion. Emerging evidence has indicated that the dysregulation of microRNAs is involved in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of this study is to explore the expression pattern and underlying mechanisms of miR-770-5p in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Consistent with our previous miRNA microarray analysis, the results of qRT-PCR showed that miR-770-5p expression was downregulated in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in humans and animal models. Administration of miR-770-5p agomir significantly reduced the fibrotic lesions in the lungs of mice exposed to silica dust. MiR-770-5p also exhibited a dramatic reduction in TGF-\u03b21-activated human pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC-5). Transfection of miR-770-5p mimics significantly decreased the viability, migration ability, and S/G0 phase distribution, as well as the expression of fibronectin, collagen I, and \u03b1-SMA in TGF-\u03b21-treated MRC-5 cells. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor 1 (TGFBR1) was confirmed as a direct target of regulation by miR-770-5p. The expression of TGFBR1 was significantly increased in pulmonary fibrosis. Knockdown of TGFBR1 blocked the transduction of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway and attenuated the activation of MRC-5 cells, while overexpression of TGFBR1 effectively restored the activation of MRC-5 cells inhibited by miR-770-5p. Together, our results demonstrated that miR-770-5p exerted an anti-fibrotic effect in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by targeting TGFBR1. Targeting miR-770-5p might provide a new therapeutic strategy to prevent the abnormal activation of pulmonary fibroblasts in silicosis."

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present work aims to elucidate the protective effects and the possible mechanism of XFBD against the acute inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We use TGF-\u03b21 induced fibroblast activation model and LPS/IL-4 induced macrophage inflammation model as in vitro cell models. The mice model of lung fibrosis was induced by BLM via endotracheal drip, and then XFBD (4.6 g/kg, 9.2\u00a0g/kg) were administered orally respectively. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of XFBD were investigated.

A rat silicosis model was established in this study, and lung tissues and serum were collected by batch execution at 14, 28, and 56 days. Also, the effects of Pirfenidone on macrophage polarization and pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated in silicosis with early intervention and late treatment by histological examination, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Hydroxyproline assay, Western blot and Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that Pirfenidone significantly reduced pulmonary fibrosis in rats with silicosis, and both early intervention and late treatment effectively inhibited the expression of \u03b1-SMA, Col-I, Vimentin, Hydroxyproline, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and the M2 macrophage marker CD206 and Arg-1, while only early intervention effectively inhibited E-cad, TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1, and the M1 macrophage marker iNOS, CD86.

In particular, Icariside II (ISE II), a prominent flavonoid glycoside derived from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim, the principal metabolite of icariin, has demonstrated noteworthy anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, along with its ability to protect against lung remodeling. However, the research exploring ISE \u2161's application in treating pulmonary fibrosis remains limited. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ISE II in models of pulmonary fibrosis, while also investigating its potential mechanisms of action in cell signaling pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in vitro model of pulmonary fibrosis was established by treating NIH-3T3 cells with transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Western blot, RT-qPCR, and scratch test were performed to assess the effect of ISE \u2161. In addition, a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, and the therapeutic effect of ISE \u2161 was tested by orally administering ISE \u2161 at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg. Three weeks later, lung function, micro-CT, hydroxyproline content, pathological staining, and cytokines detection of BALF or serum were used to assess the anti-fibrosis effects of ISE \u2161. Next, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and in vivo transcriptomics were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Our data revealed a significant inhibitory effect of ISE \u2161 on the upregulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen production induced by TGF-\u03b21 in fibroblasts. Meanwhile, ISE \u2161 exerted a therapeutic effect against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice by improving lung function, decreasing collagen deposition, and reducing the expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), TGF-\u03b21 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Additionally, ISE \u2161 treatment effectively attenuated the infiltration of M2 macrophages, concurrently downregulating the expression level of M2 marker genes, such as CD206, arginase-1(Arg-1), and Chitinase-Like Protein 3 (YM-1). Importantly, we observed a statistically significant reduction in the M2 phenotype of interstitial macrophages (IMs). However, the impact of ISE \u2161 on the M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages (AMs) did not reach statistical significance. Lastly, transcriptome sequencing results suggested that the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of ISE \u2161 may be mediated by the suppression of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which modulated M2 polarization in macrophages and contributed to the amelioration of pulmonary fibrosis. By immunohistochemical analysis, it was verified that ISE \u2161 treatment dramatically inhibited the activation of \u03b2-catenin in fibrosis murine. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that ISE \u2161 exerted anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting pro-fibrotic macrophage polarization. The underlying mechanism of action might be mediated by modulating the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway to inhibit the M2 program in IMs."

                "abstract": "Inhalation of crystalline silica particles leads to pulmonary fibrosis, eventually resulting in respiratory failure and death. There are few effective drugs that can delay the progression of this disease; thus, patients with silicosis are usually only offered supportive care. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, exhibits many biological activities and health benefits including its protective effects against hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of dioscin on silicosis is unknown. METHODS: We employed experimental mouse mode of silicosis. Different doses of dioscin were gavaged to the animals 1 day after crystalline silica instillation to see the effect of dioscin on crystalline silica induced pulmonary fibrosis. Also, we used RAW264.7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines to explore dioscin effects on macrophages and fibroblasts. Dioscin was also oral treatment but 10 days after crystalline silica instillation to see its effect on established pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: Dioscin treatment reduced pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It also reduced the recruitment of fibrocytes, protected epithelial cells from crystalline silica injury, inhibited transforming growth factor beta/Smad3 signaling and fibroblast activation. Together, these effects delayed the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism by which dioscin treatment alleviated CS-induced inflammation appeared to be via the reduction of macrophage, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocte infiltration into lung. Dioscin inhibits macrophages and fibroblasts from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and may also function as a modulator of T helper cells responses, concurrent with attenuated phosphorylation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Also, dioscin could block the phosphorylation of Smad3 in fibroblast. Oral treatment of dioscin could also effectively postpone the progression of established silicosis. CONCLUSION: Oral treatment dioscin delays crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and exerts pulmonary protective effects in mice. Dioscin may be a novel and potent candidate for protection against crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Long-term exposure to silica dust can cause silicosis, which is characterized by chronic progressive inflammatory injury, fibroblast activation, and the deposition of extracellular matrix. IRF4 is involved in immune response. However, the potential regulation of IRF4 in silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis remains largely unexplored. In this study, RNA-seq analysis identified the upregulated expression of IRF4 in fibrotic lung tissues of mice exposed to silica particles. And we verified the increased expression of IRF4 in SiO2-treated macrophages and TGF-\u03b21-treated fibroblasts. We further found that the down-regulation of IRF4 impeded the macrophage polarization and the release of pro-fibrotic factors. Moreover, the down-regulation of IRF4 alleviated the migration, invasion, and the expression of fibrotic molecules in fibroblasts. Using ChIP-qPCR assay, we confirmed that IRF4 regulated the transcriptional activity of the IL-17A promoter, thus stimulated fibroblast activation, migration and invasion. In vivo experiment, the AAV-siIRF4 was designed to interfere with the expression of IRF4 in lung tissues of mice exposed to silica particles. Whole blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were obtained from mice at 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after silica exposure. The results showed that the leukocyte content and inflammatory factors reached a peak at day 14 and remained peak for a long time after IRF4 knockdown. Furthermore, the fibrotic responses of mouse lung tissues were alleviated after IRF4 knockdown.\u00a0Our study explored the important roles of IRF4 in inflammatory and fibrotic responses, which provided a new target for the treatment of silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis."

                "abstract": "Silicosis is a long-established public health issue in developing countries due to increasingly serious air pollution and poorly implemented occupational safety regulation. Inhalation of silica triggers cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, pulmonary inflammation and eventually silicosis. Current understanding in the pathogenesis and mechanism of silicosis is limited, and no effective cure is clinically available once silicosis is developed. A number of studies were conducted to investigate silica-induced alternate gene expressions in pulmonary cells. However, transcriptome analysis in a silicosis animal model is needed. This study was performed to evaluate the transcriptional alternations in silicotic mice using comparative RNA-Seq. A silicosis mice model was established by intratracheal instillation of silica suspensions, and validated by histological examinations. High-throughput sequencing and differential gene expression analysis revealed 749 upregulated genes and 70 downregulated genes in the silicosis model. Genes related to immune cell interactions, immune cell responses and inflammation were significantly enriched. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and downstream JAK-STAT signaling pathways were the most significantly enriched KEGG pathways. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed to validate further the differential expression patterns of representative genes. The reported results in this study provide the basis for elucidating the molecular mechanisms for silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, and support the prevention and treatment of silicosis."

                "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation play a fundamental role in the beginning and advancement of silicosis. Hence, questing active phytocompounds (APCs) with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties such as diosgenin (DG) and emodin (ED) can be a therapeutic intervention targeting silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Hydrophobicity and low bioavailability are the barriers that restrict the therapeutic efficacy of DG and ED against pulmonary defects. Encapsulating these APCs in polymeric nanoparticles can overcome this limitation. The present study has thus explored the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) individually loaded with DG (DGn) or ED (EDn) and in combine DG+ED [(DG+ED)n] in respirable silica dust (RSD)-induced pulmonary fibrosis silicosis rat model. Our study found that individual and combined NPs revealed physiochemical characteristics appropriate for IV administration with sustained-drug release purposes. Physiological evaluations of RSD-induced silicosis rats suggested that no treatment could improve the body weight. Still, they reduced the lung coefficient by maintaining lung moisture. Only (DG+ED)n significantly cleared free lung silica. All interventions were found to attribute the increased per cent cell viability in BALF, reduce cytotoxicity via minimizing LDH levels, and balance the oxidant-antioxidant status in silicotic rats. The expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, and TGF-\u03b21) were efficiently down-regulated with NPs interventions compared to pure (DG+ED) treatment. All drug treatments significantly declined, the 8-HdG and HYP productions indicate that RSD-induced oxidative DNA damage and collagen deposition were successfully repaired. Moreover, histopathological investigations proposed that individual or combined drugs NPs interventions could decrease the fibrosis and alveolitis grades in RSD-induced silicosis rats. However, (DG+ED)n intervention significantly inhibited pulmonary fibrosis and alveolitis compared to pure (DG+ED) treatment. In conclusion, the RSD can induce oxidative stress and inflammation in rats, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cytotoxicity to pulmonary cells and leading to silicosis development. The IV administration of combined NP suppressed lung inflammation and collagen formation by maintaining oxidant-antioxidant status and effectively interrupting the fibrosis-silicosis progression. These results may be attributed to the improved bioavailability of DG and ED through their combined nano-encapsulation-mediated targeted drug delivery."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Silicosis is a lethal occupational disease caused by long-term exposure to respirable silica dust. Pulmonary macrophages play a crucial role in mediating the initiation of silicosis. However, the phenotypic and functional heterogeneities of pulmonary macrophages in silicosis have not been well-studied. METHODS: The silicosis mouse model was established by intratracheal administration of silica suspension. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) of mice were collected for the multiplex cytokine analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics were performed to reveal the heterogeneity and spatial localization of macrophages in the lung tissues. The formation of the fibrotic nodules was characterized by histology, hydroxyproline assay, and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. The expression of the pro-inflammatory or pro-fibrotic genes was investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: We found that the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is significantly increased in the BALFs of silicosis mice. Apparent collagen deposition can also be observed in the silicotic lung tissues. By scRNA-seq, we have identified a subpopulation of Mmp12hi macrophages significantly expanding in the lung tissues of mice with silicosis. Spatial transcriptomics analysis further confirmed that the Mmp12hi macrophages are mainly enriched in silicosis nodules. Pseudotime trajectory showed that these Mmp12hi macrophages, highly expressing both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes, are derived from Ly6c+ monocytes. Additionally, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) treatment, which can alleviate pulmonary fibrosis in silicosis mice, also reduces the enrichment of the Mmp12hi macrophages. Moreover, we found a subset of macrophages in BALFs derived from patients with silicosis exhibited similar characteristics of Mmp12hi macrophages in silicosis mice models. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that a group of Mmp12hi macrophages highly express both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors in silicosis mice, and thus may contribute to the progression of fibrosis. The findings have proposed new insights for understanding the heterogeneity of lung macrophages in silicosis, suggesting that the subset of Mmp12hi macrophages may be a potential therapy target to further halt the progression of silicosis."

            "abstract": "AIMS: Gulf War illness (GWI) is a disorder affecting military personnel deployed in the Gulf War (GW) from 1990 to 1991. Here, we will use a rat model of GWI to evaluate hippocampal function and cytokine levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were exposed to diethyltoluamide and permethrin via dermal absorption and pyridostigmine bromide via gavage with or without a 5-min restraint for 28\u00a0days. Immediate and delayed effects of GW chemical exposure were evaluated using electrophysiology to quantitate hippocampal function, behavioral tests to assess cognitive effects and biochemical assays to measure neurotransmitter and cytokine levels. KEY FINDINGS: Behavioral data revealed a statistically significant increase in motor activity at 3\u00a0months following completion of exposures, potentially indicating increased excitability, and/or restlessness. Electrophysiology data revealed statistically significant changes in paired pulse facilitation and input-output function of CA1 hippocampal neurons within 24\u00a0h and 3\u00a0months following completion of exposures. There was also a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of spontaneous firing activity of hippocampal neurons within 24\u00a0h following exposures. Na\u00efve hippocampal slices directly incubated in GW chemicals also resulted in similar changes in electrophysiological parameters. Biochemical measurements revealed reduced hippocampal glutamate level at 3\u00a0months post-exposure. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase in plasma and hippocampal levels of IL-13, as well as decrease in plasma level of IL-1\u03b2. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data support an effect on glutamate signaling within the hippocampus as indicated by changes in PPF and hippocampal level of glutamate, with some activation of T helper type 2 immune response."

                "abstract": "Gulf War illness (GWI) is a currently untreatable multi-symptom disorder experienced by 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) veterans. The characteristic hallmarks of GWI include cognitive dysfunction, tremors, migraine, and psychological disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have consistently linked these symptomatic profiles to the combined exposure of GW agents such as organophosphate-based and pyrethroid-based pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos (CPF) and permethrin (PER) respectively) and the prophylactic use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a treatment against neurotoxins. Due to the multi-symptomatic presentation of this illness and the lack of available autopsy tissue from GWI patients, very little is currently known about the distinct early pathological profile implicated in GWI (including its influence on synaptic function and aspects of neurogenesis). In this study, we used preclinical models of GW agent exposure to investigate whether 6-month-old mice exposed to CPF alone, or a combined dose of CPF, PB and PER daily for 10 days, demonstrate any notable pathological changes in hippocampal, cortical (motor, piriform) or amygdalar morphometry. We report that at an acute post-exposure time point (after 3 days), both exposures resulted in the impairment of synaptic integrity (reducing synaptophysin levels) in the CA3 hippocampal region and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG), demonstrated by a significant reduction in doublecortin positive cells. Both exposures also significantly increased astrocytic GFAP immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, motor cortex and the basolateral amygdala and this was accompanied by an increase in (basal) brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. There was no evidence of microglial activation or structural deterioration of principal neurons in these regions following exposure to CPF alone or in combination with PB and PER. Evidence of subtle microvascular injury was demonstrated by the reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 levels in CPF+PB+PER exposed group compared to control. These data support early (subtle) neurotoxic effects on the brain following exposure to GW agents. "

                "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic disease that affects the 1991 Gulf War (GW) veterans for which treatment is lacking. It has been hypothesized that drugs used to protect military personnel from chemical attacks and insects during the war: pyridostigmine bromide (PB),N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and permethrin (PER) together with stress may have contributed collectively and synergistically to generate GWI. There is a need to find markers of pathology to be used in pre-clinical trials. For this purpose we employed a previously validated mouse model of GWI evoked by daily exposure to PB (1.3\u202fmg/kg), DEET (40\u202fmg/kg), PER (0.13\u202fmg/kg), and 5\u202fmin of restraint stress for 28\u202fdays to analyze behavior, brain pathology and neurochemical outcomes three months later. GWI-model mice were characterized by increased anxiety, decreased hippocampal levels of N-acetyl aspartate, GABA, the GABA-producing enzyme GAD-67 and microglial activation. We also observed that GWI model was sexually dimorphic on some measures: males had increased while females had decreased protein levels of the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase, in the septum and hippocampus and decreased levels of the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, TrkB140, in the hippocampus. Increased hippocampal levels of nerve growth factor were detected in males only. Together the data show behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities detected at 3\u202fmonths post-exposure and that some of them are sexually dimorphic. Future preclinical studies for GWI may take advantage of this short latency model and should include both males and females as their response to treatment may differ."

                "abstract": "Residual effects of the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW) still plague veterans 30\u00a0years later as Gulf War Illness (GWI). Thought to stem mostly from deployment-related chemical overexposures, GWI is a disease with multiple neurological symptoms with likely immunological underpinnings. Currently, GWI remains untreatable, and the long-term neurological disease manifestation is not characterized fully. The present study sought to expand and evaluate the long-term implications of prior GW chemicals exposure on neurological function 6-8\u00a0months post GWI-like symptomatology induction. Additionally, the beneficial effects of delayed treatment with the glycan immunotherapeutic lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII) were evaluated. Male C57BL/6J mice underwent a 10-day combinational exposure (i.p.) to GW chemicals, the nerve agent prophylactic pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and the insecticide permethrin (PM; 0.7 and 200\u00a0mg/kg, respectively). Beginning 4 months after PB/PM exposure, a subset of the mice were treated twice a week until study completion with LNFPIII. Evaluation of cognition/memory, motor function, and mood was performed beginning 1\u00a0month after LNFPIII treatment initiation. Prior exposure to PB/PM produced multiple locomotor, neuromuscular, and sensorimotor deficits across several motor tests. Subtle anxiety-like behavior was also present in PB/PM mice in mood tests. Further, PB/PM-exposed mice learned at a slower rate, mostly during early phases of the learning and memory tests employed. LNFPIII treatment restored or improved many of these behaviors, particularly in motor and cognition/memory domains. Electrophysiology data collected from hippocampal slices 8\u00a0months post PB/PM exposure revealed modest aberrations in basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation in the dorsal or ventral hippocampus that were improved by LNFPIII treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a dopaminergic marker, did not detect major PB/PM effects along the nigrostriatal pathway, but LNFPIII increased striatal TH. Additionally, neuroinflammatory cells were increased in PB/PM mice, an effect reduced by LNFPIII. Collectively, long-term neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunction associated with prior PB/PM exposure was characterized; delayed LNFPIII treatment provided multiple behavioral and biological beneficial effects in the context of GWI, highlighting its potential as a GWI therapeutic."

                "abstract": "AIMS: The present study investigated if treatment with the immunotherapeutic, lacto-N-fucopentaose-III (LNFPIII), resulted in amelioration of acute and persisting deficits in synaptic plasticity and transmission as well as trophic factor expression along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis in a mouse model of Gulf War Illness (GWI). MAIN METHODS: Mice received either coadministered or delayed LNFPIII treatment throughout or following, respectively, exposure to a 15-day GWI induction paradigm. Subsets of animals were subsequently sacrificed 48\u00a0h, seven months, or 11\u00a0months post GWI-related (GWIR) exposure for hippocampal qPCR or in vitro electrophysiology experiments. KEY FINDINGS: Progressively worsened impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, as well as a biphasic effect on hippocampal synaptic transmission, were detected in GWIR-exposed animals. Dorsoventral-specific impairments in hippocampal synaptic responses became more pronounced over time, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus. Notably, delayed LNFPIII treatment ameliorated GWI-related aberrations in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and transmission seven and 11\u00a0months post-exposure, an effect that was consistent with enhanced hippocampal trophic factor expression and absence of increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) in animals treated with LNFPIII. SIGNIFICANCE: Approximately a third of Gulf War Veterans have GWI; however, GWI therapeutics are presently limited to targeted and symptomatic treatments. As increasing evidence underscores the substantial role of persisting neuroimmune dysfunction in GWI, efficacious neuroactive immunotherapeutics hold substantial promise in yielding GWI remission. The findings in the present report indicate that LNFPIII may be an efficacious candidate for ameliorating persisting neurological abnormalities presented in GWI."

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Epidiolex\u00ae, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cannabidiol (CBD), in improving brain function in a rat model of chronic GWI. METHODS: Six months after exposure to low doses of GWI-related chemicals [pyridostigmine bromide, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and permethrin (PER)] along with moderate stress, rats with chronic GWI were administered either vehicle (VEH) or CBD (20\u00a0mg/kg, oral) for 16\u00a0weeks. Neurobehavioral tests were conducted on 11\u00a0weeks after treatment initiation to evaluate the performance of rats in tasks related to associative recognition memory, object location memory, pattern separation, and sucrose preference.\u00a0The effect of CBD on hyperalgesia was also examined. The brain tissues were processed for immunohistochemical and molecular studies following behavioral tests. RESULTS: GWI rats treated with VEH exhibited impairments in all cognitive tasks and anhedonia, whereas CBD-treated GWI rats showed improvements in all cognitive tasks and no anhedonia. Additionally, CBD treatment alleviated hyperalgesia in GWI rats. Analysis of hippocampal tissues from VEH-treated rats revealed astrocyte hypertrophy and increased percentages of activated microglia presenting NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) complexes as well as elevated levels of proteins involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of the transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Furthermore, there were increased concentrations of proinflammatory and oxidative stress markers along with decreased neurogenesis. In contrast, the hippocampus from CBD-treated GWI rats displayed reduced levels of proteins mediating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and JAK/STAT signaling, normalized concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers, and improved neurogenesis. Notably, CBD treatment did not alter the concentration of endogenous cannabinoid anandamide in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an FDA-approved CBD (Epidiolex\u00ae) has been shown to effectively alleviate cognitive and mood impairments as well as hyperalgesia associated with chronic GWI. Importantly, the improvements observed in rats with chronic GWI in this study were attributed to the ability of CBD to significantly suppress signaling pathways that perpetuate chronic neuroinflammation."

This study sought to characterize the acute neurochemical (monoamine) and neuroinflammatory profiles of two established GWI animal models and examine the potential modulatory effects of the novel immunotherapeutic Lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII). In Model 1, male C57BL/6\u2009J mice were treated for 10 days with pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and permethrin (PM). In Model 2, a separate cohort of mice were treated for 14 days with PB and N,N-Diethyl-methylbenzamide (DEET), plus corticosterone (CORT) via drinking water on days 8-14 and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) on day 15. LNFPIII was administered concurrently with GWI chemicals treatments. Brain and spleen monoamines and hippocampal inflammatory marker expression were examined by, respectively, HPLC-ECD and qPCR, 6\u2009h post treatment cessation. Serotonergic (5-HT) and dopaminergic (DA) dyshomeostasis caused by GWI chemicals was apparent in multiple brain regions, primarily in the nucleus accumbens (5-HT) and hippocampus (5-HT, DA) for both models. Splenic levels of 5-HT (both models) and norepinephrine (Model 2) were also disrupted by GWI chemicals. LNFPIII treatment prevented many of the GWI chemicals induced monoamine alterations. Hippocampal inflammatory cytokines were increased in both models, but the magnitude and spread of inflammation was greater in Model 2; LNFPIII was anti-inflammatory, more so in the apparently milder Model 1. Overall, in both models, GWI chemicals led to monoamine disbalance and neuroinflammation. LNFPIII co-treatment prevented many of these disruptions in both models, which is indicative of its promise as a potential GWI therapeutic."

                "abstract": "AIMS: Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multi-symptom disease with debilitating cognitive and emotional impairments in veterans. GWI, like epilepsy, is caused by chemical neurotoxicity and manifests from disturbances in neuronal excitability. However, the mechanisms underlying such devastating neurological and psychiatric symptoms remain unclear. Here we investigated the long-term changes in neural behavior and brain structural abnormalities in a rat model of GWI. GWI is linked to exposure to GWI-related organophosphate chemicals (pyridostigmine bromide or PB and insecticide DEET, permethrin) during the stressful Gulf war. METHODS: To mimic GWI, we generated an experimental GWI prototype in rats by daily exposure to GWI-related chemicals with restraint stress (GWIR-CS) for 4\u00a0weeks. Changes in MRI scan and cognitive function were assessed at 5- and 10- months post-exposure. KEY FINDINGS: In MRI scans, rats displayed significant increases in lateral ventricle T2 relaxation times at both 5- and 10-months after GWIR-CS, indicating alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) density. Furthermore, at 10\u00a0months, there were significant decreases in the volumes of the hippocampus and thalamus and an increase in the lateral ventricle volume. At both time points, they exhibited impairments in multiple neurobehavioral tests, confirming substantial deficits in memory and mood function. GWI-CS rats also displayed aggressive behavior and a marked decrease in social interaction and forced swimming, indicating depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that chronic GWIR-CS exposure led to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms with concurrent neuroimaging abnormalities in CSF, with morphological neural lesions, demonstrating the role of divergent etiological mechanisms in GWI and its comorbidities."

There are ample data that demonstrate that exposure to Gulf War (GW) agents, such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and pesticides such as permethrin (PER), were key contributors to the etiology of GWI post deployment to the Persian GW. In the current study, we examined the consequences of acute (10 days) exposure to PB and PER in C57BL6 mice. Learning and memory tests were performed at 18 days and at 5 months post-exposure. We investigated the relationship between the cognitive phenotype and neuropathological changes at short and long-term time points post-exposure. No cognitive deficits were observed at the short-term time point, and only minor neuropathological changes were detected. However, cognitive deficits emerged at the later time point and were associated with increased astrogliosis and reduction of synaptophysin staining in the hippocampi and cerebral cortices of exposed mice, 5 months post exposure. In summary, our findings in this mouse model of GW agent exposure are consistent with some GWI symptom manifestations, including delayed onset of symptoms and CNS disturbances observed in GWI veterans.

                "abstract": "Following their return from deployment, Gulf War (GW) veterans reported widespread joint and muscle pain at rates that far exceeded those of soldiers returning from other conflicts. It is widely believed that exposure to insecticides, repellants and nerve gas prophylactics contributed to the symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI), but an animal model of GW pain has been elusive. In our previous work, we observed that 4-8 weeks exposure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB), permethrin and chlorpyrifos could produce persistent alterations in the physiology of Nav1.9 and Kv7 expressed in deep tissue nociceptors of the dorsal root ganglion. However, behavioral assessments from these same rats were not consistent with a delayed pain syndrome similar to that of GWI pain. In the present studies, we intensified the exposure to anticholinesterases PB and chlorpyrifos while retaining the same dosages. Animals receiving the intensified protocol for 30 days exhibited significant increases in resting for about 8 weeks after exposure. Thereafter, all measures were comparable to controls. Animals treated with intensified anticholinesterases for 60 days exhibited increased resting and reduced movement 12 weeks post-exposure. In whole cell patch studies, muscle and vascular nociceptor KDR and Kv7 ion channels exhibited increased amplitude relative to controls (e.g., normalized current and/or peak conductance) at 8 weeks post-exposures; however, at 12 weeks post-exposure, the amplitude of these currents was significantly decreased in muscle nociceptors. In current clamp studies, muscle nociceptors also manifested increased action potential duration, afterhyperpolarization and increased discharge to muscarinic agonists 12 weeks post-exposure. The decline in activity of muscle nociceptor KDR and Kv7 channel proteins was consistent with increased nociceptor excitability and a delayed myalgia in rats exposed to GW chemicals. "

We tested the efficacy of curcumin (CUR) to maintain better cognitive and mood function in a rat model of GWI because of its neurogenic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and memory and mood enhancing properties. Male rats were exposed daily to low doses of GWI-related chemicals, pyridostigmine bromide, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and permethrin, and 5-minutes of restraint stress for 28\u202fdays.

Animals also received 5'-bromodeoxyuridine during the last seven days of treatment for analysis of neurogenesis. Behavioral studies through object location, novel object recognition and novelty suppressed feeding tests performed sixty days after treatment revealed better cognitive and mood function in CUR treated GWI rats. These rats also displayed enhanced neurogenesis and diminished inflammation typified by reduced astrocyte hypertrophy and activated microglia in the hippocampus. Additional studies showed that CUR treatment to GWI rats enhanced the expression of antioxidant genes and normalized the expression of multiple genes related to mitochondrial respiration. Thus, CUR therapy is efficacious for maintaining better memory and mood function in a model of GWI. Enhanced neurogenesis, restrained inflammation and oxidative stress with normalized mitochondrial respiration may underlie better memory and mood function mediated by CUR treatment."

                "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction and neuroinflammation are conspicuously observed in Gulf War Illness (GWI). We investigated whether brain inflammation in GWI is associated with activation of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and complement-related proteins in neurons and astrocytes, and brain inflammation can be tracked through neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) found in the circulating blood. We exposed animals to GWI-related chemicals pyridostigmine bromide, DEET and permethrin, and moderate stress for 28\u202fdays. We performed behavioral tests 10\u202fmonths post-exposure and quantified activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the cerebral cortex. Then, we measured the concentration of HMGB1, proinflammatory cytokines, and complement activation-related proteins in the cerebral cortex, and NDEVs and ADEVs in the circulating blood. Cognitive impairments persisted in GWI rats at 10\u202fmonths post-exposure, which were associated with increased density of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, the level of HMGB1 was elevated in the cerebral cortex with altered expression in the cytoplasm of neuronal soma and dendrites as well as the extracellular space. Also, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-1b, and IL-6), and complement activation-related proteins (C3 and TccC5b-9) were seen in the cerebral cortex. Remarkably, increased levels of HMGB1 and proinflammatory cytokines observed in the cerebral cortex of GWI rats could also be found in NDEVs isolated from the blood. Similarly, elevated levels of complement proteins seen in the cerebral cortex could be found in ADEVs. The results provide new evidence that persistent cognitive dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation in a model of GWI are linked with elevated HMGB1 concentration and complement activation. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that multiple biomarkers of neuroinflammation could be tracked reliably via analyses of NDEVs and ADEVs in the circulating blood. Execution of such a liquid biopsy approach is especially useful in clinical trials for monitoring the remission, persistence or progression of brain inflammation in GWI patients with drug treatment."

                "abstract": "Over 20 yr have elapsed since the end of the First Gulf War, yet approximately one-third of the veterans exhibit Gulf War Illness (GWI) symptoms, particularly depression and memory impairments. Exposure to organophosphate (OP) compounds is implicated for GWI development. The role of calcium (Ca2+) signaling in learning, memory, and mood is well established and disruptions in Ca2+ homeostasis are observed in many neurological disorders. However, the status of Ca2+ homeostasis in the development of GWI behavioral impairments is not known. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to OP agent diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; 0.5 mg/kg, s.c. 5 days), and at 6 mo post-DFP exposure, rats were subjected to behavioral assays for the determination of GWI neurological morbidities. Fura-2AM loaded acutely isolated hippocampal neurons were used for [Ca2+]i estimations. We observed chronic depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits in rats exposed to repeated low-dose DFP. The GWI rats also manifested elevations in hippocampal [Ca2+]i along with a significant increase in the number of neurons displaying these elevations. As Ca2+ is a major second-messenger molecule, such sustained increases in its levels could activate multiple signaling cascades and alter gene expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and possibly underlie the neuronal injury and chronic morbidities in GWI."

                "abstract": "We investigated the effects of a combined exposure to restraint stress and low doses of chemicals pyridostigmine bromide (PB), N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and permethrin in adult male rats, a model of Gulf-War syndrome. Animals were exposed daily to one of the following for 28 days: (i) a combination of stress and chemicals (PB, 1.3 mg/kg/day; DEET, 40 mg/kg/day; and permethrin, 0.13 mg/kg/day); (ii) stress and vehicle; (iii) chemicals alone; and (iv) vehicle alone. All animals were evaluated for: (i) the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using intravenous horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections and endothelial barrier antigen (EBA) immunostaining; (ii) neuronal cell death using H&E staining, silver staining, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining; and (iii) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (m2-AChR). Animals subjected to stress and chemicals exhibited both disruption of the BBB and neuronal cell death in the cingulate cortex, the dentate gyrus, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus. Other regions of the brain, although they demonstrated some neuronal cell death, did not exhibit disruption of the BBB. The neuropathological changes in the above four brain regions were highly conspicuous and revealed by a large number of HRP-positive neurons (21-40% of total neurons), a decreased EBA immunostaining (42-51% reduction), a decreased number of surviving neurons (27-40% reduction), the presence of dying neurons (4-10% of total neurons), and an increased GFAP immunostaining (45-51% increase). These changes were also associated with decreased forebrain AChE activity and m2-AchR (19-25% reduction). In contrast, in animals exposed to stress and vehicle or chemicals alone, the above indices were mostly comparable to that of animals exposed to vehicle alone. Thus, a combined exposure to stress and low doses of PB, DEET, and permethrin leads to significant brain injury. The various neurological symptoms reported by Gulf-War veterans could be linked to this kind of brain injury incurred during the war."

                "abstract": "Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) was administered to soldiers during the first Gulf War as a prophylactic treatment to protect against toxicity in the event of exposure to nerve agents. Although originally thought to pose minimal risk to soldiers, epidemiological studies have since correlated PB administration with the development of a variety of symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, termed Gulf War Illness (GWI). We previously demonstrated in a rodent model of GWI that central cholinergic responses were altered to various stimuli. In the current study we used in vivo microdialysis to examine how combinations of PB and repeated restraint stress (RRS) altered extracellular glutamate levels in response to an innate immune challenge (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) and an immobilization stress challenge in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. There were four groups in this study: vehicle non-stressed control (Veh-NSC), vehicle-stressed (Veh-RRS), PB-NSC, and PB-RRS. While LPS decreased glutamate levels in PB-treated rats relative to vehicle-treated rats in the PFC, PB and stress interacted to attenuate LPS-induced decreases in hippocampal glutamate levels. Although immobilization stress increased glutamate in the PFC, glutamate levels in PB-NSC rats failed to recover in the post-stress period relative to vehicle-treated rats. In the hippocampus, PB-stressed rats failed to exhibit habituation of the glutamate response to immobilization stress relative to vehicle-stressed rats. Collectively, these results indicate that PB and stress interacted to produce brain-region specific effects on glutamate neurochemistry, providing insight into the potential mechanisms underlying interactions between the immune system and persistent cognitive dysfunction in veterans with GWI."

                "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multisymptom disorder that affects approximately 25-32% of Gulf War veterans and is characterized by a number of symptoms such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances, chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal distress, among others. While the exact etiology of GWI is unknown, it is believed to have been caused by toxic exposures encountered during deployment in combination with other factors such as stress. In the present study we sought to evaluate the hypothesis that exposure to the toxin permethrin could prime neuroinflammatory stress response and elicit psychiatric symptoms associated with GWI. Specifically, we developed a mouse model of GWI, to evaluate the effects of chronic permethrin exposure followed by unpredictable stress. We found that subjecting mice to 14 days of chronic permethrin exposure followed by 7 days of unpredictable stress resulted in the development of depression-like behavior. This behavioral change coincided with distinct alterations in the microglia phenotype, indicating microglial activation in the hippocampus. We revealed that blocking microglial activation through Gi inhibitory DREADD receptors in microglia effectively prevented the behavioral change associated with permethrin and stress exposure. To elucidate the transcriptional networks impacted within distinct microglia populations linked to depression-like behavior in mice exposed to both permethrin and stress, we conducted a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis using 21,566 single nuclei collected from the hippocampus of mice. For bioinformatics, UniCell Deconvolve was a pre-trained, interpretable, deep learning model used to deconvolve cell type fractions and predict cell identity across spatial datasets. Our bioinformatics analysis identified significant alterations in permethrin exposure followed by stress-associated microglia population, notably pathways related to neuronal development, neuronal communication, and neuronal morphogenesis, all of which are associated with neural synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we observed permethrin exposure followed by stress-mediated changes in signal transduction, including modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of neurotransmitter receptors, and regulation of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor activity, a known contributor to the pathophysiology of depression in a subset of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in CA3 subregions. Our findings tentatively suggest that permethrin may prime microglia towards a state of inflammatory activation that can be triggered by psychological stressors, resulting in depression-like behavior and alterations of neural plasticity. These findings underscore the significance of synergistic interactions between multi-causal factors associated with GWI."

Although the precise cause of GWI is still unknown, combined exposure to a nerve gas prophylaxis drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and pesticides DEET and permethrin during the war has been proposed as one of the foremost causes of GWI. We investigated the effect of 4 weeks of exposure to Gulf war illness-related (GWIR) chemicals in the absence or presence of mild stress on mood and cognitive function, dentate gyrus neurogenesis, and neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the hippocampus. Combined exposure to low doses of GWIR chemicals PB, DEET, and permethrin induced depressive- and anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning and memory dysfunction. Application of mild stress in the period of exposure to chemicals exacerbated the extent of mood and cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, these behavioral impairments were associated with reduced hippocampal volume and multiple cellular alterations such as chronic reductions in neural stem cell activity and neurogenesis, partial loss of principal neurons, and mild inflammation comprising sporadic occurrence of activated microglia and significant hypertrophy of astrocytes. The results show the first evidence of an association between mood and cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal pathology epitomized by decreased neurogenesis, partial loss of principal neurons, and mild inflammation in a model of GWI. Hence, treatment strategies that are efficacious for enhancing neurogenesis and suppressing inflammation may be helpful for alleviation of mood and cognitive dysfunction observed in GWI. "

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gulf War (GW) Illness (GWI) is a debilitating condition with a complex constellation of immune, endocrine and neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. We studied a novel model of GWI based on 3 known common GW exposures (GWE): (i) intranasal lipopolysaccharide, to which personnel were exposed during desert sand storms; (ii) pyridostigmine bromide, used as prophylaxis against chemical warfare; and (iii) chronic unpredictable stress, an inescapable element of war. We used this model to evaluate prophylactic treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist, rosiglitazone (ROSI). METHODS: Rats were subjected to the three GWE for 33 days. In series 1 and 2, male and female GWE-rats were compared to na\u00efve rats. In series 3, male rats with GWE were randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment with ROSI (GWE-ROSI) or vehicle. After the 33-day exposures, three neurofunctional domains were evaluated: cognition (novel object recognition), anxiety-like behaviors (elevated plus maze, open field) and depression-like behaviors (coat state, sucrose preference, splash test, tail suspension and forced swim). Brains were analyzed for astrocytic and microglial activation and neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1, tumor necrosis factor and translocator protein). Neurofunctional data from rats with similar exposures were pooled into 3 groups: na\u00efve, GWE and GWE-ROSI. RESULTS: Compared to na\u00efve rats, GWE-rats showed significant abnormalities in the three neurofunctional domains, along with significant neuroinflammation in amygdala and hippocampus. There were no differences between males and females with GWE. GWE-ROSI rats showed significant attenuation of neuroinflammation and of some of the neurofunctional abnormalities. CONCLUSION: This novel GWI model recapitulates critical neurofunctional abnormalities reported by Veterans with GWI. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with ROSI was beneficial in this model."

                "abstract": "Many veterans of Operation Desert Storm (ODS) struggle with the chronic pain of Gulf War Illness (GWI). Exposure to insecticides and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) have been implicated in the etiology of this multisymptom disease. We examined the influence of 3 (DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), permethrin, chlorpyrifos) or 4\u202fGW agents (DEET, permethrin, chlorpyrifos, pyridostigmine bromide (PB)) on the post-exposure ambulatory and resting behaviors of rats. In three independent studies, rats that were exposed to all 4 agents consistently developed both immediate and delayed ambulatory deficits that persisted at least 16\u202fweeks after exposures had ceased. Rats exposed to a 3 agent protocol (PB excluded) did not develop any ambulatory deficits. Cellular and molecular studies on nociceptors harvested from 16WP (weeks post-exposure) rats indicated that vascular nociceptor Nav1.9 mediated currents were chronically potentiated following the 4 agent protocol but not following the 3 agent protocol. Muscarinic linkages to muscle nociceptor TRPA1 were also potentiated in the 4 agent but not the 3 agent, PB excluded, protocol. Although Kv7 activity changes diverged from the behavioral data, a Kv7 opener, retigabine, transiently reversed ambulation deficits. We concluded that PB played a critical role in the development of pain-like signs in a GWI rat model and that shifts in Nav1.9 and TRPA1 activity were critical to the expression of these pain behaviors."

                "abstract": "Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War were potentially exposed to a variety of toxic chemicals, including sarin nerve agent and pesticides, which have been suspected to be involved in the development of Gulf War Illness (GWI). Several of these exposures cause a neuroinflammatory response in mice, which may serve as a basis for the sickness behavior-like symptoms seen in veterans with GWI. Furthermore, conditions mimicking the physiological stress experienced during the war can exacerbate this effect. While neuroinflammation has been observed post-exposure using animal models, it remains a challenge to evaluate neuroinflammation and its associated cellular and molecular changes in vivo in veterans with GWI. Here, we evaluated neuroimmune-associated alterations in intact brains, applying our existing GWI mouse model to rats, by exposing them to 4days of corticosterone (CORT; 200mg/L in the drinking water), to mimic high physiological stress, followed by a single injection of the sarin nerve agent surrogate, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; 1.5mg/kg, i.p.). Then, we evaluated the neuroinflammatory responses using qPCR of cytokine mRNA and also examined brain structure with a novel high-order diffusion MRI. We found a CORT-enhancement of DFP-induced neuroinflammation, extending our mouse GWI model to the rat. High order diffusion MRI revealed different patterns among the different treatment groups. Particularly, while the CORT+DFP rats had more restricted spatial patterns in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus, the highest and most wide-spread differences were shown in DFP-treated rats compared to the controls in the thalamus, the amygdala, the piriform cortex and the ventral tegmental area. The association of these diffusion changes with neuroinflammatory cytokine expression indicates the potential for GW-relevant exposures to result in connectivity changes in the brain. By transferring this high order diffusion MRI into in vivo imaging in veterans with GWI, we can achieve further insights on the trajectories of the neuroimmune response over time and its impacts on behavior and potential neurological damage."

                "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multi-symptom disorder afflicting the veterans of the First Gulf War, and includes neurological symptoms characterized by depression and memory deficits. Chronic exposure to organophosphates (OPs) is considered a leading cause for GWI, yet its pathobiology is not fully understood. We recently observed chronic elevations in neuronal Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) in an OP-diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-based rat model for GWI. This study was aimed at identifying mechanisms underlying elevated [Ca2+]i in this DFP model and investigating whether their therapeutic targeting could improve GWI-like neurological morbidities. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (9 weeks) were exposed to DFP (0.5 mg/kg, s.c., 1\u00d7-daily for 5 days) and at 3 months postDFP exposure, behavior was assessed and rats were euthanized for protein estimations and ratiometric Fura-2 [Ca2+]i estimations in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. In DFP rats, a sustained elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels occurred, and pharmacological blockade of Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release mechanisms significantly lowered elevated [Ca2+]i in DFP neurons. Significant reductions in the protein levels of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) stabilizing protein Calstabin2 were also noted. Such a posttranslational modification would render RyR \"leaky\" resulting in sustained DFP [Ca2+]i elevations. Antagonism of RyR with levetiracetam significantly lower elevated [Ca2+]i in DFP neurons and improved GWI-like behavioral symptoms. Since Ca2+ is a major second messenger molecule, such chronic increases in its levels could underlie pathological synaptic plasticity that expresses itself as GWI morbidities. Our studies show that treatment with drugs targeted at blocking intracellular Ca2+ release could be effective therapies for GWI neurological morbidities."

            "abstract": "Although sleep-wake disturbances are prevalent and well described after traumatic brain injury, their pathophysiology remains unclear, most likely because human traumatic brain injury is a highly heterogeneous entity that makes the systematic study of sleep-wake disturbances in relation to trauma-induced histological changes a challenging task. Despite increasing interest, specific and effective treatment strategies for post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances are still missing. With the present work, therefore, we aimed at studying acute and chronic sleep-wake disturbances by electrophysiological means, and at assessing their histological correlates after closed diffuse traumatic brain injury in rats with the ultimate goal of generating a model of post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances and associated histopathological findings that accurately represents the human condition. We assessed sleep-wake behavior by means of standard electrophysiological recordings before and 1, 7, and 28 days after sham or traumatic brain injury procedures. Sleep-wake findings were then correlated to immunohistochemically labeled and stereologically quantified neuronal arousal systems. Compared with control animals, we found that closed diffuse traumatic brain injury caused increased sleep need one month after trauma, and sleep was more consolidated. As histological correlate, we found a reduced number of histamine immunoreactive cells in the tuberomammillary nucleus, potentially related to increased neuroinflammation. Monoaminergic and hypocretinergic neurotransmitter systems in the hypothalamus and rostral brainstem were not affected, however. These results suggest that our rat traumatic brain injury model reflects human post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances and associated histopathological findings very accurately, thus providing a study platform for novel treatment strategies for affected patients."

                "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability worldwide. Post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances are extremely common and difficult for patients to manage. Sleep and wake disturbances contribute to poor functional and emotional outcomes from TBI, yet effective therapies remain elusive. A more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying post-TBI sleep and wake disturbance will facilitate development of effective pharmacotherapies. Previous research in human patients and animal models indicates that altered hypocretinergic function may be a major contributor to sleep-wake disturbance after TBI. In this study, we further elucidate the role of hypocretin by determining the impact of TBI on sleep-wake behavior of hypocretin knockout (HCRT KO) mice. Adult male C57BL/6J and HCRT KO mice were implanted with electroencephalography recording electrodes, and pre-injury baseline recordings were obtained. Mice were then subjected to either moderate TBI or sham surgery. Additional recordings were obtained and sleep-wake behavior determined at 3, 7, 15, and 30 days after TBI or sham procedures. At baseline, HCRT KO mice had a significantly different sleep-wake phenotype than control C57BL/6J mice. Post-TBI sleep-wake behavior was altered in a genotype-dependent manner: sleep of HCRT KO mice was not altered by TBI, whereas C57BL/6J mice had more non-rapid eye movement sleep, less wakefulness, and more short wake bouts and fewer long wake bouts. Numbers of hypocretin-positive cells were reduced in C57BL/6J mice by TBI. Collectively, these data indicate that the hypocretinergic system is involved in the alterations in sleep-wake behavior that develop after TBI in this model, and suggest potential therapeutic interventions."

                "abstract": "Many complex behavioral phenomena such as sleep can not be explained without multidisciplinary experimental approach, and complementay approaches in the animal models \"in vivo\" and human studies. Electrophysiological, pharmacological, anatomical and immunohistochemical techniques, and particularly stereotaxically guided local nanovolume microinjection technique, enable us to selectively stimulate and lesion the brain nuclei or their specific neuronal subpopulation, and to reslove the mechanisms of certain brain structure regulatory role, and its afferent-efferent connectivity within the brain. Local stereotaxically guided nanovolume microinjection technique enable us to investigate in animals the brain nulcei functional topography with a resolution of < or = 10 microM, and at a level of 300 microM of effective radius within the brain tissue \"in vivo\". The advantage of local glutamate or DL- homocysteic acid microinjection stimulation or local excitotoxic (glutamate, ibotenic acid, IgG saporin) microinjection lesion over electrical stimulation/lesion of the same neuronal population are that they reduces the likelihood of activation/lesion of fibers of passage. Much of our knowledge of the sleep neuronal substrates is based on animal studies primarly in cat and rat. Selective pharmacological stimulation of the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) in freely moving rat, using glutamate microinjection, proved that excitation of its cholinergic part is necessary for induction of wakefulness or REM (Datta S, 2001). Local nanovolume glutamate microinjection into PPT of anesthetized rats (Saponji\u0107 et al, 2003a) additionally evidenced P-wave and respiratory regulating neuronal subpopulation within the cholinergic compartment of PPT (apneogenic neuronal zone). Local microinjection of serotonin and noradrenaline into cholinergic PPT apneogenic zone evidenced their opposed impact through PPT on breathing, in contrast to their convergent regulatory role in behavioral state control (Saponji\u0107 et al., 2005a). Also, selective pharmacological stimulation by microinjection of DL-homocysteic acid defined four neuronal micro-circuitry approximately 500 microm in lenght of breathing-related neurons within the ventral respiratory group of medulla oblongata, which when stimulated produce different effects on respiratory rate, rhythm and amplitude, and on blood pressure. This study was the first high resolution study in order to understand anatomical and functional neuronal system organization (Monnier et al., 2003). Recently, local glutamate microinjection stimulation technique enabled detailed functional topography of respiratory, cardiovascular and pontine-wave responses within the PPT (Topchiy et al., 2010). Discovery of \"flip-flop\" switch for REM sleep control is based on the experiments in rats using local stereotaxically guided microinjection of excitotoxins (ibotenic acid, IgG saporin), and the anterograde and retrograde tracers for selective lesion, and identifying \"REM-off\" and \"REM- on\" regions and their afferent-efferent connections, and for identifying pathways for REM atonia and REM EEG activation (Lu et al., 2006). Recently, selective lesion of SLD part of \"REM-on\" region in rat established an animal model of RBD, as well as a selective ibotenic acid lesion of PC part of \"REM-on\" region abolished theta during REM (Lu et al., 200; Anaclet et al., 2010). Selective ablation targeted to pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex neurons of ventrolateral respiratory group of medulla in rat induced REM related respiratory disorder up to 10 days, when this respiratory disorder became spreaded to all sleep phases, and even during wakefulness, due to long-lasting intermitent hypoxia, and an increase of the threshold for hypoxia/hypercapnea induced arousal response (McKay et al., 2005). Human development, maturation, healthy aging and many neurological diseases are associated with profound changes in sleep/wake states distribution and with variety of the sleep-related behavioral disorders. Sleep and sleep-related respiratory disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnias, excessive nocturnal motor activity, circadian sleep-wake rhythm disturbances, respiratory dysrhythmias, RBD) are very frequently unnoticed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases (Boeve et al., 2007; Whitwell et al., 2007). Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD, PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with prevalence of 0.5-1%; increasing to 1-3% for Parkinson, and up to 50% for Alzheimer's disease in ages over 69 (Nussbaum and Christopher, 2003). In spite of a long knowledge of their clinical description and brain pathology (lesions of the NB cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain, dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, etc.), they remain incurable with only limited success in temporal amelioration of their symptoms. Clinical symptoms first appear at 65-69 years on average, but there are indications that subclinical features may start many years earlier. Patients with REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) face close to a 20% 5-year risk of developing PD or dementia, and that risk rises to more than 40% after 10 years, and exceeds 50% after 12 years. Human studies evidenced that sleep/wake cycle disturbance, as no cognitive symptom of dementia, precedes on average 3 years before the clinical diagnosis of the AD (Simic et al., 2009), and that RBD, precedes as symptom the onset of motor and cognitive disturbances by years or decades. AD and PD involve the selective loss of specific neuronal populations within the brain. RBD in those patients reflects an underlying synucleinopathy, with presence of the alpha-synuclein protein pathology within the REM sleep-related regulatory structures of the dorsal midbrain and pons at the onset of disease, with ascending pattern of neurodegeneration progression from brainstem to basal areas of the brain (Whitwell et al., 2007; Simic et al., 2009: Raggi and Ferri, 2010). On the base of hypothesis that basal forebrain cholinergic system plays an important role in the etiology of the most common neurodegenerative diseases of elderly (AD, PD), the lesion of the nucleus basalis in rat presents the most utilized \"in vivo\" animal model to study the disorders of cortical cholinergic innervation, and its impact on higher central nervous system functions. Our knowledge of the neural substrates for sleep/wake states and sleep-related behavior disorders regulation in health and the diseases, over more than 50 years of sleep research, is based on animal models, pharmacotherapy, central nervous system lesions, and the neuropathological studies in humans. Today we have many complementary animal models of human sleep pathology, and further work in fundamental multidisciplinary and clinical research between sleep and neurodegenerative disease investigators is promising to enable us understand normal and abnormal sleep, and may provide new insights into preventive or disease-altering approaches for therapy. Obviously counseling and prevention of AD or PD would be highly enriched by the development of a practical, sensitive and reliable methodology of detecting those patients with RBD, or other sleep disorders, who are at risk for developing AD or PD."

                "abstract": "Sleep-wake disturbances following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are increasingly recognized as a serious consequence following injury and as a barrier to recovery. Injury-induced sleep-wake disturbances can persist for years, often impairing quality of life. Recently, there has been a nearly exponential increase in the number of primary research articles published on the pathophysiology and mechanisms underlying sleep-wake disturbances after TBI, both in animal models and in humans, including in the pediatric population. In this review, we summarize over 200 articles on the topic, most of which were identified objectively using reproducible online search terms in PubMed. Although these studies differ in terms of methodology and detailed outcomes; overall, recent research describes a common phenotype of excessive daytime sleepiness, nighttime sleep fragmentation, insomnia, and electroencephalography spectral changes after TBI. Given the heterogeneity of the human disease phenotype, rigorous translation of animal models to the human condition is critical to our understanding of the mechanisms and of the temporal course of sleep-wake disturbances after injury. Arguably, this is most effectively accomplished when animal and human studies are performed by the same or collaborating research programs. Given the number of symptoms associated with TBI that are intimately related to, or directly stem from sleep dysfunction, sleep-wake disorders represent an important area in which mechanistic-based therapies may substantially impact recovery after TBI."

                "abstract": "Disorders of sleep and wakefulness occur in the majority of individuals who have experienced traumatic brain injury (TBI), with increased sleep need and excessive daytime sleepiness often reported. Behavioral and pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy, in part, because the etiology of post-TBI sleep disturbances is not well understood. Severity of injuries resulting from head trauma in humans is highly variable, and as a consequence so are their sequelae. Here, we use a controlled laboratory model to investigate the effects of TBI on sleep-wake behavior and on candidate neurotransmitter systems as potential mediators. We focus on hypocretin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), hypothalamic neuropeptides important for regulating sleep and wakefulness, and two potential downstream effectors of hypocretin actions, histamine and acetylcholine. Adult male C57BL/6 mice (n=6-10/group) were implanted with EEG recording electrodes and baseline recordings were obtained. After baseline recordings, controlled cortical impact was used to induce mild or moderate TBI. EEG recordings were obtained from the same animals at 7 and 15 days post-surgery. Separate groups of animals (n=6-8/group) were used to determine effects of TBI on the numbers of hypocretin and MCH-producing neurons in the hypothalamus, histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, and cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. At 15 days post-TBI, wakefulness was decreased and NREM sleep was increased during the dark period in moderately injured animals. There were no differences between groups in REM sleep time, nor were there differences between groups in sleep during the light period. TBI effects on hypocretin and cholinergic neurons were such that more severe injury resulted in fewer cells. Numbers of MCH neurons and histaminergic neurons were not altered under the conditions of this study. Thus, we conclude that moderate TBI in mice reduces wakefulness and increases NREM sleep during the dark period, effects that may be mediated by hypocretin-producing neurons and/or downstream cholinergic effectors in the basal forebrain."

The pathobiology of sleep disorders in TBI, however, is not well understood, and animal models have been underused in studying such changes and potential underlying mechanisms. We used the rat lateral fluid percussion (LFP) model to analyze sleep-wake patterns as a function of time after injury. Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, and wake bouts during light and dark phases were measured with electroencephalography and electromyography at an early as well as chronic time points after LFP. Moderate TBI caused disturbances in the ability to maintain consolidated wake bouts during the active phase and chronic loss of wakefulness. Further, TBI resulted in cognitive impairments and depressive-like symptoms, and reduced the number of orexin-A-positive neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. "

                "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of persistent disabilities such as sleep-wake disorders (SWD). Rodent studies of SWD after TBI are scarce, however, because of lack of appropriate TBI models reproducing acceleration-deceleration forces and compatible with electroencephalography/myography (EEG/EMG)-based recordings of vigilance states. We therefore adapted the Marmarou impact acceleration model to allow for compatibility with EEG-headset implantation. After implantation of EEG/EMG electrodes, we induced closed TBI by a frontal, angular hit with a weight-drop device (56 rats, weight 2500\u2009g, fall height 25\u2009cm). Subsequently, we tested our model's usefulness for long-term studies on a behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological level. Neurological, motor, and memory deficits were assessed with the neurological severity score, open field, and novel object recognition tests, respectively. EEG/EMG recordings were performed in both Sham (n\u2009=\u20097) and TBI (n\u2009=\u20097) rats before and 1, 7, and 28 days after trauma to evaluate sleep-wake proportions and post-traumatic implant stability. Histological assessments included hematoxylin and eosin staining for parenchymal damage and hemorrhage and amyloid precursor protein staining for diffuse axonal damage. All rats survived TBI without major neurological or motor deficits. Memory function was impaired after TBI at weeks 1, 2, and 3 and recovered at week 4. EEG implants were stable for at least 1 month and enabled qualitative and quantitative sleep analyses. Histological assessments revealed no major bleedings or necrosis but intense diffuse axonal damage after TBI. This approach fulfills major pre-conditions for experimental TBI models and offers a possibility to electrophysiologically study behavioral states before and after trauma."

                "abstract": "Post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances are common after acute traumatic brain injury. Increased sleep need per 24 h and excessive daytime sleepiness are among the most prevalent post-traumatic sleep disorders and impair quality of life of trauma patients. Nevertheless, the relation between traumatic brain injury and sleep outcome, but also the link between post-traumatic sleep problems and clinical measures in the acute phase after traumatic brain injury has so far not been addressed in a controlled and prospective approach. We therefore performed a prospective controlled clinical study to examine (i) sleep-wake outcome after traumatic brain injury; and (ii) to screen for clinical and laboratory predictors of poor sleep-wake outcome after acute traumatic brain injury. Forty-two of 60 included patients with first-ever traumatic brain injury were available for follow-up examinations. Six months after trauma, the average sleep need per 24 h as assessed by actigraphy was markedly increased in patients as compared to controls (8.3 \u00b1 1.1 h versus 7.1 \u00b1 0.8 h, P < 0.0001). Objective daytime sleepiness was found in 57% of trauma patients and 19% of healthy subjects, and the average sleep latency in patients was reduced to 8.7 \u00b1 4.6 min (12.1 \u00b1 4.7 min in controls, P = 0.0009). Patients, but not controls, markedly underestimated both excessive sleep need and excessive daytime sleepiness when assessed only by subjective means, emphasizing the unreliability of self-assessment of increased sleep propensity in traumatic brain injury patients. At polysomnography, slow wave sleep after traumatic brain injury was more consolidated. The most important risk factor for developing increased sleep need after traumatic brain injury was the presence of an intracranial haemorrhage. In conclusion, we provide controlled and objective evidence for a direct relation between sleep-wake disturbances and traumatic brain injury, and for clinically significant underestimation of post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances by trauma patients.

Here, we sought to determine whether sleep characteristics could predict development of PTE in a model of severe TBI. Methods: Following controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham injury (craniotomy only), CD-1 mice were implanted with epidural electroencephalography (EEG) and nuchal electromyography (EMG) electrodes. Acute (1st week) and chronic (months 1, 2, or 3) 1-week-long video-EEG recordings were performed after the injury to examine epileptiform activity. High-amplitude interictal events were extracted from EEG using an automated method. After scoring sleep-wake patterns, sleep spindles and EEG delta power were derived from nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep epochs. Brain CTs (computerized tomography) were performed in sham and CCI cohorts to quantify the brain lesions. We then employed a no craniotomy (NC) control to perform 1-week-long EEG recordings at week 1 and month 1 after surgery. Results: Posttraumatic seizures were seen in the CCI group only, whereas interictal epileptiform activity was seen in CCI or sham. Sleep-wake disruptions consisted of shorter wake or NREM bout lengths and shorter duration or lower power for spindles in CCI and sham. NREM EEG delta power increased in CCI and sham groups compared with NC though the CCI group with posttraumatic seizures had lower power at a chronic time point compared with those without. Follow-up brain CTs showed a small lesion in the sham injury group suggesting a milder form of TBI that may account for their interictal activity and sleep changes. Significance: In our TBI model, tracking changes in NREM delta power distinguishes between CCI acutely and animals that will eventually develop PTE, but further work is necessary to identify sleep biomarkers of PTE. Employing NC controls together with sham controls should be considered in future TBI studies."

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) represents a useful complementary approach in the study of sleep pathophysiology. We aimed to determine in this study whether post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are associated with changes in excitability of the cerebral cortex. TMS was performed 3 months after mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 11 patients with subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS; defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale \u226510), 12 patients with objective EDS (as defined by mean sleep latency <5 on multiple sleep latency tests), 11 patients with fatigue (defined by daytime tiredness without signs of subjective or objective EDS), 10 patients with post-traumatic hypersomnia \"sensu strictu,\" and 14 control subjects. Measures of cortical excitability included central motor conduction time, resting motor threshold (RMT), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation to paired-TMS. RMT was higher and SICI was more pronounced in the patients with objective EDS than in the control subjects. In the other patients all TMS parameters did not differ significantly from the controls. Similarly to that reported in patients with narcolepsy, the cortical hypoexcitability may reflect the deficiency of the excitatory hypocretin/orexin-neurotransmitter system. These observations may provide new insights into the causes of chronic sleepiness in patients with TBI. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic SWD may also lead to better therapeutic strategies in these patients."

                "abstract": "Chronic sleep/wake disturbances (SWDs) are strongly associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in patients and are being increasingly recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely understudied and there is an urgent need for animal models of lifelong SWDs. The objective of this study was to develop a chronic TBI rodent model and investigate the lifelong chronic effect of TBI on sleep/wake behavior. We performed repetitive midline fluid percussion injury (rmFPI) in 4-month-old mice and monitored their sleep/wake behavior using the non-invasive PiezoSleep system. Sleep/wake states were recorded before injury (baseline) and then monthly thereafter. We found that TBI mice displayed a significant decrease in sleep duration in both the light and dark phases, beginning at 3 months post-TBI and continuing throughout the study. Consistent with the sleep phenotype, these TBI mice showed circadian locomotor activity phenotypes and exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior. TBI mice also gained less weight, and had less lean mass and total body water content, compared to sham controls. Further, TBI mice showed extensive brain tissue loss and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 levels in the hypothalamus and vicinity of the injury, indicative of chronic neuropathology. In summary, our study identified a critical time window of TBI pathology and associated circadian and sleep/wake phenotypes. Future studies should leverage this mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the chronic sleep/wake phenotypes post-TBI early in life."

                "abstract": "Chronic neurological impairments can manifest from repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI), particularly when subsequent injuries occur before the initial injury completely heals. Herein, we apply post-traumatic sleep as a physiological biomarker of vulnerability, hypothesizing that a second TBI during post-traumatic sleep worsens neurological and histological outcomes compared to one TBI or a second TBI after post-traumatic sleep subsides. Mice received sham or diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion injury; brain-injured mice received one TBI or rTBIs at 3- or 9-h intervals. Over 40\u2009h post-injury, injured mice slept more than shams. Functional assessments indicated lower latencies on rotarod and increased Neurological Severity Scores for mice with rTBIs within 3\u2009h. Anxiety-like behaviors in the open field task were increased for mice with rTBIs at 3\u2009h. Based on pixel density of silver accumulation, neuropathology was greater at 28 days post-injury (DPI) in rTBI groups than sham and single TBI. Cortical microglia morphology was quantified and mice receiving rTBI were de-ramified at 14 DPI compared to shams and mice receiving a single TBI, suggesting robust microglial response in rTBI groups. Orexin-A-positive cells were sustained in the lateral hypothalamus with no loss detected, indicating that loss of wake-promoting neurons did not contribute to post-traumatic sleep. Thus, duration of post-traumatic sleep is a period of vulnerability that results in exacerbated injury from rTBI. Monitoring individual post-traumatic sleep is a potential clinical tool for personalized TBI management, where regular sleep patterns may inform rehabilitative strategies and return-to-activity guidelines."

A better understanding of the impact that sleep disturbances have on chronic TBI symptomatology is likely to maximize long-term recovery. While the current treatments of sleep-wake disturbances following TBI are disorder-specific, identifying the underlying pathology may lead to improved pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments. A TBI initiates secondary cellular and molecular cascades that include inflammation and the production of cytokines, as well endocrine dysfunction and concomitant disturbances in hormone secretions. Hormones and cytokines are mediators of the inflammatory response that also regulate endocrine function, thus, communication between the immune and endocrine systems is bidirectional. Interestingly, both the immune and endocrine systems play a critical role in sleep regulation. This narrative review summarizes sleep-wake disturbances reported after TBI and synthesizes the current human and animal literature centered on the hypothesis that immune-endocrine interactions after TBI may induce both acute and chronic disturbances of sleep and wakefulness. Furthermore, we discuss how the immune and endocrine systems may be plausible therapeutic targets to treat TBI-induced sleep disturbances."

The high prevalence and socioeconomic burden of SWDs post-TBI have only been recognized in the past decade. Common SWDs induced by TBI include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hypersomnia, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Sleep disturbances can significantly compromise quality of life, strain interpersonal relationships, diminish work productivity, exacerbate other clinical conditions, and impede the rehabilitation process of TBI patients. Consequently, the prompt regulation and enhancement of sleep homeostasis in TBI patients is of paramount importance. Although studies have shown that abnormal neural network function, neuroendocrine changes, disturbance of sleep-wake regulators, and immune inflammatory responses related to brain structural damage induced by TBI are involved in the development of SWDs, the exact neuropathological mechanisms are still poorly understood. Therefore, we systematically review the current clinical and experimental studies on the characteristics and possible neural mechanisms of post-TBI SWDs. Elucidating the neural underpinnings of post-TBI SWDs holds the potential to diversify and enhance therapeutic approaches for these conditions. Such advancements could hasten the recuperation of TBI patients and ameliorate their overall quality of life. It is our aspiration that departments specializing in neurosurgery, rehabilitation, and neuropsychiatry will be able to recognize and address these conditions promptly, thereby facilitating the healing journey of affected individuals."

Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to impact acceleration head injury, using a pneumatic impact targeted to a steel disc centered onto their skull. The severity of injury was graded as three levels by adjusting the driving pressure at 60, 70 or 80 pounds per square inch. In vivo MRI was obtained 2 days post-injury. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze at 1 and 2 weeks post-injury. HE staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess neuronal and axonal damages after 2 weeks. MRI demonstrated that this model induced no gross structural modification in the brain. The degree and duration of cognitive dysfunction were dependent on the force of impact. Histological analysis revealed the force-dependent damage of the neurons and microtubule-associated protein 2-positive axons in the neocortex. Hippocampal damage was much less pronounced and was not linked to cognitive dysfunction. This is the first report that precisely evaluates the threshold of impact energy to lead to neocortical damage and cognitive dysfunction in rodents. This model would be suitable for clarifying the complex mechanisms of post-traumatic brain damage and testing novel therapeutic approaches against post-traumatic cognitive dysfunction due to diffuse axonal damage."

We review the spectrum of traumatic brain injury associated sleep disorders and discuss clinical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: Disordered sleep and wakefulness after TBI is common. Sleep disruption contributes to morbidity, such as the development of neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, and prolongs the recovery phase after injury. Early recognition and correction of these problems may limit the secondary effects of traumatic brain injury and improve neuro recovery/patient outcomes.

BTBI resulted in general hypoactivity in the open field (OF) at both PI time points for SG-housed animals. In contrast, CBI did not cause hypoactivity. Mice subjected to CBI traveled more in the center of the OF at both time points PI, suggesting that CBI caused reduced anxiety in mice. Increased activity in the center of the OF was also seen at 24\u202fh PI after BTBI. CBI treatment caused increased CD11b immunostaining. However, neither injury was accompanied by an alteration in the number of orexin-A hypothalamic neurons. Taken together, shock wave exposure and concussive injury transiently reduced mouse activities, but some differences between the two injuries were seen."

            "abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the most widely used model for alcoholic liver injury is ad libitum feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 4-6 weeks; however, this model, without the addition of a secondary insult, only induces mild steatosis, slight elevation of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and little or no inflammation. Here we describe a simple mouse model of alcoholic liver injury by chronic ethanol feeding (10-d ad libitum oral feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet) plus a single binge ethanol feeding. This protocol for chronic-plus-single-binge ethanol feeding synergistically induces liver injury, inflammation and fatty liver, which mimics acute-on-chronic alcoholic liver injury in patients. This feeding protocol can also be extended to chronic feeding for longer periods of time up to 8 weeks plus single or multiple binges. Chronic-binge ethanol feeding leads to high blood alcohol levels; thus, this simple model will be very useful for the study of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and of other organs damaged by alcohol consumption."

                "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in Western countries. The spectrum of ALD ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Over the past 50\u00a0years, several animal models of ALD have been developed. Although none of them faithfully recapitulates the human disease, they have proven to be invaluable tools to study the pathogenesis of ALD, to identify potential therapeutic targets and to test new drugs. Here, we describe the mouse model of chronic and binge ethanol feeding, also known as the NIAAA model or Gao binge model. This model combines chronic feeding of Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet with acute administration of high-dose ethanol by oral gavage to mimic the drinking patterns of many alcoholic patients who engage in episodes of binge drinking on top of chronic daily drinking. Short-term (10-day) chronic plus single binge ethanol feeding causes a substantial increase in serum transaminase levels, moderate steatosis and mild inflammation characterized by lobular neutrophil infiltration. Long-term (8-week) chronic plus single or multiple (twice a week) binge ethanol feeding induce more severe steatohepatitis and mild fibrosis. This clinically relevant, easy-to-perform model of ALD is currently used by many research laboratories to reproduce early stages of human alcoholic steatohepatitis."

Recently, we developed a chronic plus binge alcohol feeding model in mice that is similar to the drinking patterns of many alcoholic hepatitis patients: a history of chronic drinking and recent excessive alcohol consumption. Chronic+binge ethanol feeding synergistically induced steatosis, liver injury, and neutrophil infiltration in mice, which may be useful for the study of early alcoholic liver injury and inflammation. Using this chronic+binge model, researchers have begun to identify novel mechanisms that participate in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury, thereby revealing novel therapeutic targets.

                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Interleukin-22 (IL-22), a recently identified member of the IL-10 family of cytokines that is produced by Th17 and natural killer cells, plays an important role in controlling bacterial infection, homeostasis, and tissue repair. Here, we tested the effect of IL-22 on alcohol-induced liver injury in a murine model of chronic-binge ethanol feeding. Feeding male C57BL/6 mice with a Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% ethanol for 10 days, followed by a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) by gavage, induces significant fatty liver and liver injury with peak serum levels of approximately 250 IU/L alanine aminotransferase and 420 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase 9 hours after gavage. Moreover, chronic-binge ethanol administration increases expression of hepatic and serum inflammatory cytokines and hepatic oxidative stress. Using this model, we demonstrate that treatment with IL-22 recombinant protein activates hepatic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and ameliorates alcoholic fatty liver, liver injury, and hepatic oxidative stress. Administration with IL-22 adenovirus also prevents alcohol-induced steatosis and liver injury. Deletion of STAT3 in hepatocytes abolishes the hepatoprotection provided by IL-22 in alcoholic liver injury. In addition, IL-22 treatment down-regulates the hepatic expression of fatty acid transport protein, but up-regulates several antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antimicrobial genes. Finally, expression of IL-22 receptor 1 is up-regulated whereas IL-22 is undetectable in the livers from mice with chronic-binge ethanol feeding or patients with alcoholic hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Chronic-binge ethanol feeding may be a useful model to study the early stages of alcoholic liver injury. IL-22 treatment could be a potential therapeutic option to ameliorate alcoholic liver disease, due to its antioxidant, antiapoptotic, antisteatotic, proliferative, and antimicrobial effects with the added benefit of potentially few side effects."

                "abstract": "The goal of this project was to establish the effect of alcohol consumption on the circulating levels of the adipose tissue derived protein C1q TNF Related Protein 3 (CTRP3). Adipose tissue secretes several adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, which exert a multitude of biological effects important for human health. However, adipose tissue is extremely sensitive to alcohol consumption, leading not only to disrupted fat storage, but also to disruptions in adipokine production. Changes to adipokine secretion could have widespread biological effects and potentially contribute to alcohol-induced ailments, such as alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD). CTRP3 has been previously demonstrated to attenuate fatty liver disease, and suppression of CTRP3 with alcohol consumption could contribute to development of and progression to alcoholic fatty liver disease. To examine the effect of ethanol consumption on circulating adipokine levels, male and female mice were fed an ethanol containing diet (Lieber-DeCarli 5% (v/v) ethanol diet) for 10-days followed by a single gavage of 5 g/kg ethanol (the NIAAA model), or for 6-weeks with no binge added (chronic model). In female mice, adiponectin levels increased ~2-fold in both models of ethanol feeding, but in male mice increased adiponectin levels were only observed after chronic ethanol feeding. On the other hand, in female mice, circulating CTRP3 levels decreased by ~75% and ~50% in the NIAAA and chronic model, respectively, with no changes observed in the male mice in either feeding model. Leptin levels were unchanged with ethanol feeding regardless of model or sex of mice. Lastly, chronic ethanol feeding led to a significant increase in mortality (~50%) in female mice, with no difference in relative ethanol consumption. These findings indicate that ethanol consumption can dysregulate adipokine secretion, but that the effects vary by sex of animal, method of ethanol consumption, and adipokine examined. These findings also indicate that female mice are more sensitive to the chronic effects of ethanol than male mice. Notably, this is the first study to document the effects of ethanol consumption on the circulating levels of CTRP3. Understanding the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on adipokine production and secretion could identify novel mechanisms of alcohol-induced human disease. However, the mechanism responsible for the increased sensitivity remains elusive."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alcohol use disorders are major risk factors for the development of and susceptibility to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although these risks of alcohol consumption on the lung are well described, mechanisms by which alcohol abuse promotes acute lung injury are poorly understood. These gaps in our understanding are due, at least in part, to limitations of animal models to recapitulate human alcohol consumption. Recently, a new model of chronic plus binge alcohol exposure was developed that is hypothesized to better model drinking patterns of individuals with alcohol use disorders. Specifically, this paradigm models chronic consumption coupled with periodic bouts of heavy drinking. The impacts of this alcohol-exposure regimen on the lung are uncharacterized. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine lung injury and inflammation in a well-characterized experimental model of chronic\u00a0+\u00a0binge alcohol exposure. METHODS: 10-week-old male C57Bl6/J mice were administered ethanol-containing (or isocaloric control) liquid diet for 10 days, followed by a single ethanol gavage (5\u00a0g/kg). Lung inflammation and pulmonary function were assessed. RESULTS: Ten days of ethanol-containing liquid diet\u00a0alone (chronic) did not detectably affect any variables measured. However, ethanol diet plus gavage (chronic\u00a0+\u00a0binge) caused neutrophils to accumulate in the lung tissue and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24\u00a0h post-binge. This inflammatory cell recruitment was associated with airway hyper-responsiveness to inhaled methacholine, as indicated by elevated resistance, Newtonian resistance, and respiratory resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the novel findings reveal that ethanol alone, absent of any secondary inflammatory insult, is sufficient to produce inflammation in the lung. Although these changes were relatively mild, they were associated with functional changes in the central airways. This animal model may be useful in the future for identifying mechanisms by which alcohol abuse sensitizes at-risk individuals to lung injury."

Pueraria lobata (PUE) and Silybum marianum (SIL) are two well-known hepatoprotective herbal remedies with various activities. The possible effect of combination of PUE and SIL on ALD has not been elucidated yet. PURPOSE: We aimed to demonstrate that the combination of PUE and SIL prevents against alcoholic liver injury in mice using a model of chronic-plus-single-binge ethanol feeding. STUDY DESIGN: Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n\u202f=\u202f8-10), namely the control group (CON), ethanol-induced liver injury group (ETH), 150\u202fmg/kg PUE treated group (PUE), 60\u202fmg/kg SIL treated group (SIL), 210\u202fmg/kg PUE+SIL treatment group (PUE+SIL). Except control group, all animals were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet for 10 days. While, control group received Lieber-DeCarli control diet containing isocaloric maltose dextrin substituted for ethanol. On day 11, the mice orally received a single dose of 31.5% (v/v) ethanol (5\u202fg/kg BW) or an isocaloric maltose solution. RESULTS: Ethanol exposure caused liver injury, as demonstrated by remarkably increased plasma parameters, histopathological changes, the increased lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation in liver. These alterations were ameliorated by the treatments of PUE, SIL and PUE+SIL. While, the PUE+SIL treatment showed the most effective protection, which was associated with reducing alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis via upregulating LKB1/AMPK/ACC signaling, and inhibiting hepatic inflammation via LPS-triggered TLR4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our results also indicated that the hepatoprotective effects of SIL+PUE might mainly attribute to the protection of SIL and PUE alone in alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and hepatic inflammation, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings also suggest that the combination of PUE and SIL has a potential to be developed as a functional food for the management of ALD."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Excess ethanol consumption has serious pathologic consequences. In humans, repeated episodes of binge drinking can lead to liver damage and have adverse effects on other organs such as pancreas and brain. Long term chronic consumption of ethanol can also result in progressive alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic regulator with multiple physiologic functions. FGF21 is a novel biomarker for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans and limits hepatotoxicity in mice. Therefore, we explored the possibility that FGF21 plays a role in response to ethanol consumption in both humans and mice. METHODS: We used a binge drinking paradigm in humans to examine the effect of acute ethanol consumption on circulating FGF21. We adapted this paradigm to evaluate the acute response to ethanol in mice. We then examined the role of FGF21 on liver pathology in two models of chronic ethanol consumption in both wild type (WT) mice and mice lacking FGF21 (FGF21-KO). RESULTS: Acute ethanol consumption resulted in a robust induction of serum FGF21 after 6\u00a0h in both humans and mice. Serum ethanol peaked at 1\u00a0h in both species and was cleared by 6\u00a0h. Ethanol clearance was the same in WT and FGF21-KO mice, indicating that FGF21 does not play a major role in ethanol metabolism in a binge paradigm. When FGF21-KO mice were fed the Lieber-DeCarli diet, a high fat diet supplemented with ethanol, a higher mortality was observed compared to WT mice after 16 days on the diet. When FGF21-KO mice consumed 30% ethanol in drinking water, along with a normal chow diet, there was no mortality observed even after 16 weeks, but the FGF21-KO mice had significant liver pathology compared to WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or binge ethanol consumption significantly increases circulating FGF21 levels in both humans and mice. However, FGF21 does not play a role in acute ethanol clearance. In contrast, chronic ethanol consumption in the absence of FGF21 is associated with significant liver pathology alone or in combination with excess mortality, depending on the type of diet consumed with ethanol. This suggests that FGF21 protects against long term ethanol induced hepatic damage and may attenuate progression of alcoholic liver disease. Further study is required to assess the therapeutic potential of FGF21 in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are two of the most common etiologies of chronic liver disease worldwide. Changes in intestinal permeability and increased gut microbial translocation have been posited as important contributors to inflammation in both ALD and NAFLD. However, gut microbial translocation has not been compared between the two etiologies and can lead to better understanding of the differences in their pathogenesis to liver disease. METHODS: We compared serum and liver markers in the following five models of liver disease to understand the differences in the role of gut microbial translocation on liver disease progression caused by ethanol versus Western diet: (1) 8-week chronic ethanol feeding model. (2) 2-week chronic-plus-binge (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)) ethanol feeding model. (3) 2-week chronic-plus-binge (NIAAA) ethanol feeding model in microbiota-humanized gnotobiotic mice colonized with stool from patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis. (4) 20-week Western-diet-feeding model of NASH. (5) 20-week Western-diet-feeding model in microbiota-humanized gnotobiotic mice colonized with stool from NASH patients. RESULTS: Translocation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide to the peripheral circulation was seen in both ethanol-induced and diet-induced liver disease, but translocation of bacteria itself was restricted to only ethanol-induced liver disease. Moreover, the diet-induced steatohepatitis models developed more significant liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis compared with ethanol-induced liver disease models, and this positively correlated with the level of lipopolysaccharide translocation. CONCLUSIONS: More significant liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis are seen in diet-induced steatohepatitis, which positively correlates with translocation of bacterial components, but not intact bacteria."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and NAFLD often coexist in Western societies that consume energy-rich and cholesterol-containing Western diets. Increased rates of ALD mortality in young people in these societies are likely attributable to binge drinking. It is largely unknown how alcohol binge causes liver damage in the setting of Western diets. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this study, we showed that a single ethanol binge (5 g/kg body weight) induced severe liver injury as shown by marked increases in serum activities of the 2 aminotransferases AST and ALT in C57BL/6J mice that have been fed a Western diet for 3 weeks. The Western diet plus binge ethanol-fed mice also displayed severe lipid droplet deposition and high contents of triglycerides and cholesterol in the liver, which were associated with increased lipogenic and reduced fatty acid oxidative gene expression. These animals had the highest Cxcl1 mRNA expression and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive neutrophils in the liver. Their hepatic ROS and lipid peroxidation were the highest, but their hepatic levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins remained largely unaltered. Hepatic levels of several ER stress markers, including mRNAs for CHOP, ERO1A, ERO1B, BIM, and BIP, as well as Xbp1 splicing and proteins for BIP/GRP78 and IRE-\u03b1 were also the highest in these animals. Interestingly, Western diet feeding for 3 weeks or ethanol binge dramatically increased hepatic caspase 3 cleavage, and the combination of the 2 did not further increase it. Thus, we successfully established a murine model of acute liver injury by mimicking human diets and binge drinking. CONCLUSIONS: This simple Western diet plus single ethanol binge model recapitulates major hepatic phenotypes of ALD, including steatosis and steatohepatitis characterized by neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, and ER stress."

                "abstract": "Impaired intestinal barrier function plays a critical role in alcohol-induced hepatic injury, and the subsequent excessive absorbed endotoxin and bacterial translocation activate the immune response that aggravates the liver injury. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG supernatant (LGG-s) has been suggested to improve intestinal barrier function and alleviate the liver injury induced by chronic and binge alcohol consumption, but the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. In this study, chronic-binge alcohol fed model was used to determine the effects of LGG-s on the prevention of alcoholic liver disease in C57BL/6 mice and investigate underlying mechanisms. Mice were fed Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% alcohol for 10 days, and one dose of alcohol was gavaged on Day 11. In one group, LGG-s was supplemented along with alcohol. Control mice were fed isocaloric diet. Nine hours later the mice were sacrificed for analysis. Chronic-binge alcohol exposure induced an elevation in liver enzymes, steatosis and morphology changes, while LGG-s supplementation attenuated these changes. Treatment with LGG-s significantly improved intestinal barrier function reflected by increased mRNA expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and villus-crypt histology in ileum, and decreased Escherichia coli (E. coli) protein level in liver. Importantly, flow cytometry analysis showed that alcohol reduced Treg cell population while increased TH17 cell population as well as IL-17 secretion, which was reversed by LGG-s administration. In conclusion, our findings indicate that LGG-s is effective in preventing chronic-binge alcohol exposure-induced liver injury and shed a light on the importance of the balance of Treg and TH17 cells in the role of LGG-s application.

                "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a well-characterized mouse model of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) regression. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Lieber-DeCarli (LD) control diet or LD containing 5% ethanol for ten days followed by one binge, which is the chronic-binge model of AH developed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. To determine AH regression, mice previously exposed to ethanol were put on LD control diet and metabolic and inflammatory features were monitored weekly for three weeks. Serum alcohol, total cholesterol, and alanine transaminase levels were increased in ethanol-fed mice, which declined to those of no ethanol controls within one and three weeks after ethanol withdrawal, respectively. Serum malondialdehyde was increased with ethanol feeding, but it was restored to no ethanol control levels within one week. Ethanol-induced changes in the hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, ethanol metabolism, and antioxidant response were restored to those of no ethanol controls after 3 weeks of ethanol withdrawal. Also, ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation was gradually decreased during the 3 weeks of ethanol withdrawal. Hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and the expression of enzymes involved in the NAD+ salvage pathway were decreased by ethanol feeding, which was mitigated after ethanol withdrawal. Ethanol significantly lowered hepatic sirtuin 1 expression, but its levels were restored with ethanol cessation. This study established a mouse model of AH regression, which can be used as a preclinical model to study the potential of dietary bioactives or therapeutic agents on AH regression."

                "abstract": "AIMS: This study sought to compare mice bred to preferentially consume high amounts of alcohol (crossed-high alcohol preferring, cHAP) to c57BL/6 (C57) mice using a chronic-binge ethanol ingestion model to induce alcoholic liver disease (ALD). METHODS: Male C57 and cHAP mice were randomized to a Lieber-DeCarli control (LDC) diet, Lieber-DeCarli 5% (v/v) ethanol (LDE) diet or free-choice between 10% (v/v) ethanol in drinking water (EtOH-DW) and DW. After 4 weeks mice were gavaged with either 9 g/kg maltose-dextrin (LDC+MD) or 5 g/kg EtOH (LDE+Binge, EtOH-DW+Binge). Nine hours later tissue and serum were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: cHAP mice on EtOH-DW consumed significantly more ethanol than cHAP or C57 mice maintained on LDE. However, cHAP and C57 mice on the LDE+Binge regiment had greater hepatosteatosis and overall degree of liver injury compared to EtOH-DW+Binge. Changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression was more pronounced in cHAP mice than C57 mice. Analysis of liver enzymes revealed a robust induction of CYP2E1 in C57 and cHAP mice maintained on EtOH-DW+Binge or LDE+Binge. However, while C57 mice exhibited higher basal hepatic glutathione than cHAP mice, these mice appeared more susceptible to oxidative stress following LDE+Binge than cHAP counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Despite cHAP mice consuming more total ethanol prior to gavage when maintained on EtOH-DW, LDE followed by gavage created a more severe model of ALD in both C57 and cHAP mice. These data suggest factors other than total amount of alcohol consumed affect degree of ALD development in the chronic-binge model in cHAP mice. SHORT SUMMARY: cHAP mice voluntarily consume high amounts of ethanol and exhibited hepatic injury when subject to chronic-binge ethanol feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli diet. However, hepatic injury was reduced in cHAP mice in a chronic-binge model following voluntary high ethanol consumption in drinking water."

The aim of this study was to use a chronic plus binge ethanol feeding model in mice to evaluate the effects of aging on alcohol-induced liver injury. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to short-term (10days) ethanol plus one binge or long-term (8weeks) ethanol plus multiple binges of ethanol. Liver injury and fibrosis were determined. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated and used in in vitro studies. RESULTS: Middle-aged (12-14months) and old-aged (>16months) mice were more susceptible to liver injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress induced by short-term plus one binge or long-term plus multiple binges of ethanol feeding when compared to young (8-12weeks) mice. Long-term plus multiple binges of ethanol feeding induced greater liver fibrosis in middle-aged mice than that in young mice. Hepatic expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein was downregulated in the middle-aged mice compared to young mice. Restoration of SIRT1 expression via the administration of adenovirus-SIRT1 vector ameliorated short-term plus binge ethanol-induced liver injury and fibrosis in middle-aged mice. HSCs isolated from middle-aged mice expressed lower levels of SIRT1 protein and were more susceptible to spontaneous activation in in vitro culture than those from young mice. Overexpression of SIRT1 reduced activation of HSCs from middle-aged mice in vitro with downregulation of PDGFR-\u03b1 and c-Myc, while deletion of SIRT1 activated HSCs isolated from young mice in vitro. Finally, HSC-specific SIRT1 knockout mice were more susceptible to long-term chronic-plus-multiple binges of ethanol-induced liver fibrosis with upregulation of PDGFR-\u03b1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Aging exacerbates ALD in mice through the downregulation of SIRT1 in hepatocytes and HSCs. Activation of SIRT1 may serve as a novel target for the treatment of ALD. LAY SUMMARY: Aged mice are more susceptible to alcohol-induced liver injury and fibrosis, which is, at least in part, due to lower levels of sirtuin 1 protein in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. Our findings suggest that sirtuin 1 activators may have beneficial effects for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease in aged patients."

                "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a leading cause of chronic liver injury worldwide, comprises a range of disorders including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Over the last five decades, many animal models for the study of ALD pathogenesis have been developed. Recently, a chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model was reported. This model induces significant steatosis, hepatic neutrophil infiltration, and liver injury. A clinically relevant model of high-fat diet feeding plus binge ethanol was also developed, which highlights the risk of excessive binge drinking in obese/overweight individuals. All of these models recapitulate some features of the different stages of ALD and have been widely used by many investigators to study the pathogenesis of ALD and to test for therapeutic drugs/components. However, these models are somewhat variable, depending on mouse genetic background, ethanol dose, and animal facility environment. This review focuses on these models and discusses these variations and some methods to improve the feeding protocol. The pathogenesis, clinical relevance, and translational studies of these models are also discussed."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity and the metabolic syndrome occur in approximately one-third of patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The increased consumption of fructose parallels the increased prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in the United States and worldwide. In this study, we investigated whether dietary high fructose potentiates chronic alcohol-induced liver injury, and explored potential mechanism(s). METHODS: Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were assigned to 4 groups: control, high fructose, chronic ethanol (EtOH), and high fructose plus chronic alcohol. The mice were fed either control diet or high-fructose diet (60%, w/w) for 18\u00a0weeks. Chronic alcohol-fed mice were given 20% (v/v) ethanol (Meadows-Cook model) ad\u00a0libitum as the only available liquid from the 9th week through the 18th week. Liver injury, steatosis, hepatic inflammatory gene expression, and copper status were assessed. RESULTS: High-fructose diet and chronic alcohol consumption alone each induce hepatic fat accumulation and impair copper status. However, the combination of dietary high fructose plus chronic alcohol synergistically induced liver injury as evidenced by robustly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, but the combination did not exacerbate hepatic fat accumulation nor worsen copper status. Moreover, FE-fed mice were characterized by prominent microvesicular steatosis. High-fructose diet and chronic alcohol ingestion together led to a significant up-regulation of Kupffer cell (KC) M1 phenotype gene expression (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), as well as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling gene expression, which is also associated with the up-regulation of KCs and activation marker gene expression, including Emr1, CD68, and CD163. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dietary high fructose may potentiate chronic alcohol consumption-induced liver injury. The underlying mechanism might be due to the synergistic effect of dietary high fructose and alcohol on the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway, which in turn leads to KC activation and phenotype switch toward M1 polarization. This study suggests that alcohol-fructose combination contributes to ALD progression."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is the progressive form of alcoholic liver disease and may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific disruption of Fsp27 (Fsp27(Hep-/-) mice) were fed the Lieber-Decarli ethanol liquid diet (5% ethanol) for 10 days to 12 weeks, followed by 1 or multiple binges of ethanol (5 or 6 g/kg) during the chronic feeding. Some mice were given an inhibitor (GW9662) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPARG). Adenoviral vectors were used to express transgenes or small hairpin (sh) RNAs in cultured hepatocytes and in mice. Liver tissue samples were collected from ethanol-fed mice or from 31 patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) with biopsy-proved ASH and analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically and by transcriptome, immunoblotting, and real-time PCR analyses. RESULTS: Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding of mice, which mimics the drinking pattern of patients with AH, produced severe ASH and mild fibrosis. Microarray analyses revealed similar alterations in expression of many hepatic genes in ethanol-fed mice and humans with ASH, including up-regulation of mouse Fsp27 (also called Cidec) and human CIDEC. Fsp27(Hep-/-) mice and mice given injections of adenovirus-Fsp27shRNA had markedly reduced ASH following chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Inhibition of PPARG and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein H (CREBH) prevented the increases in Fsp27\u03b1 and FSP27\u03b2 mRNAs, respectively, and reduced liver injury in this chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model. Overexpression of FSP27 and ethanol exposure had synergistic effects in inducing production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and damage to hepatocytes in mice. Hepatic CIDEC mRNA expression was increased in patients with AH and correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis and disease severity including mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding induces ASH that mimics some histological and molecular features observed in patients with AH. Hepatic expression of FSP27/CIDEC is highly up-regulated in mice following chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and in patients with AH; this up-regulation contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mouse models of alcohol-associated liver disease vary greatly in their ease of implementation and the pathology they produce. Effects range from steatosis and mild inflammation with the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet to severe inflammation, fibrosis, and pyroptosis seen with the Tsukamoto-French intragastric feeding model. Implementation of all of these models is limited by the labor-intensive nature of the protocols and the specialized skills necessary for successful intragastric feeding. We thus sought to develop a new model to reproduce features of alcohol-induced inflammation and fibrosis with minimal operational requirements. METHODS: Over a 16-week period, mice were fed ad libitum with a pelleted high-fat Western diet (WD; 40% calories from fat) and alcohol added to the drinking water. We found the optimal alcohol consumption to be that at which the alcohol concentration was 20% for 4\u00a0days and 10% for 3\u00a0days per week. Control mice received WD pellets with water alone. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption was 18 to 20\u00a0g/kg/day in males and 20 to 22\u00a0g/kg/day in females. Mice in the alcohol groups developed elevated serum transaminase levels after 12\u00a0weeks in males and 10\u00a0weeks in females. At 16\u00a0weeks, both males and females developed liver inflammation, steatosis, and pericellular fibrosis. Control mice on WD without alcohol had mild steatosis only. Alcohol-fed mice showed reduced HNF4\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression. HNF4\u03b1 is a master regulator of hepatocyte differentiation, down-regulation of which is a known driver of hepatocellular failure in alcoholic hepatitis. CONCLUSION: A simple-to-administer, 16-week WD alcohol model recapitulates the inflammatory, fibrotic, and gene expression aspects of human alcohol-associated steatohepatitis."

                "abstract": "Both chronic and acute (binge) alcohol drinking are important health and economic concerns worldwide and prominent risk factors for the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). There are no FDA-approved medications to prevent or to treat any stage of ALD. Therefore, discovery of novel therapeutic strategies remains a critical need for patients with ALD. Relevant experimental animal models that simulate human drinking patterns and mimic the spectrum and severity of alcohol-induced liver pathology in humans are critical to our ability to identify new mechanisms and therapeutic targets. There are several animal models currently in use, including the most widely utilized chronic ad libitum ethanol (EtOH) feeding (Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet model), chronic intragastric EtOH administration (Tsukamoto-French model), and chronic-plus-binge EtOH challenge (Bin Gao-National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) model). This review provides an overview of recent advances in rodent models of binge EtOH administration which help to recapitulate different features and etiologies of progressive ALD. These models include EtOH binge alone, and EtOH binge coupled with chronic EtOH intake, a high fat diet, or endotoxin challenge. We analyze the strengths, limitations, and translational relevance of these models, as well as summarize the liver injury outcomes and mechanistic insights. We further discuss the application(s) of binge EtOH models in examining alcohol-induced multi-organ pathology, sex- and age-related differences, as well as circadian rhythm disruption."

                "abstract": "Alcoholism is a multifactorial and complex disorder responsible for 5.9% of deaths worldwide. Excessive consumption of ethanol (Et-OH) induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a condition comprising a spectrum of clinical signs and morphological changes, ranging from fatty liver (steatosis) to more severe forms of chronic liver injury. Secondary cofactors, such as nutritional and hepatotoxic comorbid conditions, can also contribute to liver disease development. Here we investigated the effects in the progression of ALD following short-term exposure to diet high in refined carbohydrates (HC), a high-sugar and -butter (HSB) hypercaloric diet and acute Et-OH consumption. HSB diet increased the body weight (BW) and adiposity independently of acute Et-OH consumption. HC diet did not affect BW but increased the adiposity, while acute Et-OH alone did not affect BW and adiposity. All groups of mice developed steatosis except the control group. Exposure to acute Et-OH and HSB diet increased the number of neutrophils and macrophages, and apoptosis in the liver. This combination also increased the number of circulating neutrophils and reduced mononuclear cells in the blood. Thus, short-term exposure to HSB diet and acute Et-OH intake is linked to increased liver injury. These findings offer important clues to understand the hepatic injuries associated with short exposure to hypercaloric diets and acute Et-OH."

Neuropathologic examination disclosed hemorrhagic necrotic lesions in the thalamus, hypothalamus, collicular plate, vestibular nuclei, and inferior olives. The control groups did not show neurologic signs or neuropathologic abnormalities. The lesions in thiamine-deficient rats were similar in character and distribution to those of human Wernicke's disease. Because this experimental regimen produces neuropathologic changes rapidly and consistently, this animal model should be useful in studies designed to examine the pathophysiologic aspects of experimental Wernicke's disease in particular and CNS thiamine deficiency in general."

Electron microscopic examination of the brains from animals sacrificed at four progressively severe stages of pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) revealed neurocytopathological changes identical to those that have been described in glutamate-induced excitotoxic lesions. These degenerative changes occurred in gelatinosus (Ge) and anteroventral ventrolateral (AVVL) nuclei at an early symptomatic stage and in the ventroposterolateral (VPL), ventroposteromedial (VPM), and ventrolateral (VL) nuclei at slightly later stages of PTD. Light microscopic evaluation of separate groups of PTD rats administered thiamine at each of the same four neurologic stages and allowed to recover for 1 week demonstrated that thiamine treatment is more effective when administered at earlier stages. However, Ge, AVVL, and VPL nuclei sustain severe damage even when thiamine is administered prior to acute neurologic signs. Furthermore, pathologic changes in the mammillary and several midline intralaminar nuclei begin after thiamine administration and reinstitution of thiamine-replete diet to animals in more severe stages of thiamine deficiency. These and other recent findings suggest that excitotoxic and possibly apoptotic mechanisms may mediate neuronal degeneration in the PTD rat model of Wernicke's encephalopathy, and that multiple factors conducive to excitotoxicity may act in concert to produce this syndrome."

                "abstract": "The causality of vascular and parenchymal damage to the central nervous system (CNS) was examined in rats with thiamine deficiency. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups; one was given a thiamine-deficient diet (TDD) and injected intraperitoneally with 10 micrograms/100 g bodyweight pyrithiamine (PT) in order to analyze morphometrically the topographical and sequential relationship between vascular and parenchymal changes and vasodilatation, and the other was given a TDD and 50 micrograms/100 g bodyweight PT in order to determine hemorrhagic sites using serial sections. Histological examination showed that spongiotic change occurred selectively in the inferior colliculus (100%) from day 19, and thereafter in the thalamus (95%), mammillary body (50%) and nuclei olivaris and vestibularis of the pons (25%), with or without hemorrhage. Simultaneously, glycogen accumulation was also observed in these regions at a frequency similar to that of hemorrhage. Ultrastructurally, however, hydropic swelling of astrocytic and neuronal processes without glycogen accumulation was observed as early as day 9 in the inferior colliculus, at which time an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive processes was also recognized. The superior colliculus was completely spared. From day 22 vasodilatation of the inferior colliculus occurred, concomitantly with bodyweight loss and neurological symptoms. Twenty-two examined hemorrhages, which occurred in the thalamus and inferior colliculus, were distributed along the arterioles or capillaries on the arterial side. In conclusion, the morphological CNS changes caused by thiamine deficiency with administration of low-dose PT in rats begin as hydropic swelling of neuronal and astrocytic processes, followed by hemorrhage and, thereafter, by vasodilation. The predilection for hemorrhage on the arterial side without parenchymal changes suggests that petechial hemorrhage is not simply secondary to parenchymal changes, but is due to hemodynamic change resulting from thiamine deficiency-induced vascular dysfunction."

Changes were mainly due to the reduction in glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), suggesting that a reduction in GPC may be relevant to the primary biochemical lesion in TD. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that a decrease in choline compounds is the cause of the biochemical abnormalities that precede neuroanatomic damage characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy."

As thiamin deficiency progressed, the extent and intensity of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in brain structures typically affected by thiamin deficiency (the thalamus, mammillary bodies, inferior colliculus, vestibular nucleus and inferior olives) were markedly increased when compared to thiamin-replete controls. Glucose loading for 1-3 days further increased the intensity of FLI in these same regions, consistent with a dependence of Fos expression on carbohydrate metabolism as well as on thiamin deficiency. The timed acute changes that follow a bolus glucose load administered to thiamin-deficient animals may provide a sequential account of events in the pathogenesis of brain damage in this model of Wernicke's encephalopathy."

                "abstract": "Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is characterized by lesions in thalamus, hypothalamus (including mammillary nuclei), and inferior colliculi, results in serious disabilities, has an etiology of thiamine deficiency, is treatable with thiamine, and occurs most commonly with alcoholism. Despite decades of study, whether alcohol exposure exacerbates the neuropathology or retards its resolution remains controversial. To examine patterns of brain damage and recovery resulting from thiamine deprivation with and without alcohol exposure, we conducted in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3 T in alcohol-preferring (P) rats, which had voluntarily consumed large amounts of alcohol before thiamine manipulation. A total of 18 adult male P rats (nine alcohol-exposed) received a thiamine-deficient diet for 2 weeks: 10 (five alcohol-exposed) received intraperitoneal (i.p.) pyrithiamine (PT) and eight (four alcohol-exposed) received i.p. thiamine supplementation. Neurological signs developed by day 14. Rats were scanned before thiamine depletion and 18 and 35 days after thiamine repletion. Two-dimensional J-resolved MRS single-voxel spectra with water reference were collected in a voxel subtending the thalamus; metabolite quantification was corrected for voxel tissue content. MRI identified significant enlargement of dorsal ventricles and increase in signal intensities in thalamus, inferior colliculi, and mammillary nuclei of PT compared with thiamine-treated (TT) groups from MRI 1-2, followed by significant normalization from MRI 2-3 in thalamus and colliculi, but not mammillary nuclei and lateral ventricles. Voxel-by-voxel analysis revealed additional hyperintense signal clusters in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. MRS showed a significant decline and then partial recovery in thalamic N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal integrity, in PT compared with TT rats, with no change detected in creatine, choline, or glutamate. PT rats with prior alcohol exposure exhibited attenuated recovery in the thalamus and arrested growth of the corpus callosum; further, two of the five alcohol-exposed PT rats died prematurely. Parenchymal and ventricular changes with thiamine manipulation concur with human radiological signs of WE. The enduring macrostructural and neurochemical abnormalities involving critical nodes of Papez circuit carry liabilities for development of amnesia and incomplete recovery from other cognitive and motor functions subserved by the affected neural systems."

                "abstract": "Three experiments were conducted to examine the role of histamine in neuronal degeneration in a rat model of Wernicke's encephalopathy induced by an acute bout of pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD). In the first experiment, histamine levels in medial thalamus of freely moving PTD rats measured by microdialysis were increased (180% of controls) at a prelesion stage of thiamine deficiency (treatment day 12) and further elevated 48 hr later (380%) in the same animals when necrosis was evident. Histamine levels in dialysates of the hippocampus collected simultaneously from the same animals were unchanged at either stage of thiamine deficiency. Glutamate levels in microdialysates from the same animals were unchanged at the prelesion stage but were significantly elevated on the second collection day. In a second experiment, separate groups of PTD and pairfed control (CT) rats were infused continuously with either alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH; 80 mg/day, i.p.), an irreversible inhibitor of histamine synthesis, or saline. FMH pretreatment produced a significant protection against PTD-induced neuronal loss within the midline-intralaminar and anteromedial thalamic nuclei, but had no effect on damage to ventrolateral nuclei, anteroventral nucleus, or the mammillary bodies. In a third study, histamine (80 micrograms, free base) or vehicle was directly infused into the same region of medial thalamus dialyzed in experiment 1. Histamine infusion into prelesion PTD but not CT animals resulted in severe neuronal loss and gliosis. Infusion of vehicle into the same regions of PTD and CT rats produced a mild gliosis restricted to the needle tract with no evidence of neuronal loss. These observations together with recent evidence of a histamine enhancement of glutamate receptor activation suggest that early histamine release may contribute significantly to glutamate-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated excitotoxic neuronal death in thiamine deficiency-induced Wernicke's encephalopathy."

No changes in alpha KGDH occurred prior to the onset of neurological signs of thiamine deprivation. Administration of the central thiamine antagonist, pyrithiamine, results within 3 weeks in loss of righting reflex and convulsions and in more widespread neuropathological changes than those observed following thiamine deprivation. alpha KGDH activities were found to be substantially diminished in all brain regions studied following pyrithiamine treatment with most severe changes occurring in brain regions found to be vulnerable to pyrithiamine (lateral vestibular nucleus, hypothalamus, midbrain, medulla-pons). In some cases, alpha KGDH changes preceded the appearance of neurological symptoms of pyrithiamine treatment. Such decreases in alpha KGDH may explain previous findings of region-selective changes in energy metabolism and of decreased synthesis of glucose-derived neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate) in pyrithiamine-treated rat brain. Thiamine administration to symptomatic pyrithiamine treated rats resulted in reversal of neurological signs of encephalopathy and in normalisation of defective alpha KGDH activity in all brain regions. These findings suggest that the reversible neurological symptoms associated with Wernicke's Encephalopathy in man likely result from region-selective impairment of alpha KGDH."

                "abstract": "In order to test the hypothesis that Wernicke's encephalopathy is of topographic rather than of pathogenetic specificity we examined the brains of 49 patients without any evidence of chronic alcoholism. They had died at least four days after an event of severe hypoxia-ischemia. They all showed extensive lesions in the cortex, in the thalamus and in other regions. In 19 of them there was additional necrosis in the mamillary bodies which apparently was of the same age as the associated cortical and thalamic lesions and which could not be distinguished from Wernicke's encephalopathy. In three of the 19 cases there was a total necrosis within the mamillary bodies. By re-examining the mamillary bodies of 12 known alcoholics without any evidence for an ischemic impact we could affirm that total necrosis may fit into the spectrum of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Our findings demonstrate that the morphological changes in the mamillary bodies due to thiamine deficiency and those due to hypoxia-ischemia may be identical."

Recent work building upon early observations in animal models of thiamine deficiency has demonstrated an inflammatory component to the neuropathology observed in thiamine deficiency. The present, multilevel study including in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and postmortem quantification of chemokine and cytokine proteins sought to determine whether a combination of these in vivo neuroimaging tools could be used to characterize an in vivo MR signature for neuroinflammation. Thiamine deficiency for 12days was used to model neuroinflammation; glucose loading in thiamine deficiency was used to accelerate neurodegeneration. Among 38 animals with regional brain tissue assayed postmortem for cytokine/chemokine protein levels, three groups of rats (controls+glucose, n=6; pyrithiamine+saline, n=5; pyrithiamine+glucose, n=13) underwent MRI/MRS at baseline (time 1), after 12days of treatment (time 2), and 3h after challenge (glucose or saline, time 3). In the thalamus of glucose-challenged, thiamine deficient animals, correlations between in vivo measures of pathology (lower levels of N-acetyle aspartate and higher levels of lactate) and postmortem levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, also known as chemokine ligand 2, CCL2) support a role for this chemokine in thiamine deficiency-related neurodegeneration, but do not provide a unique in vivo signature for neuroinflammation.

                "abstract": "Breakdown of the blood brain barrier and the subsequent accumulation of free radicals, lactate, and glutamate appear to be the immediate causes of thiamine deficiency (TD)-induced damage to thalamus. The mechanisms triggering these events are unknown but recent evidence suggests an important role of histamine. We therefore studied the effects of histamine depletion on thalamic lesions in the pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficient (PTD) rat. Chronic intracerebroventricular (i.c.v., 7 days) infusion of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), combined with bilateral ibotenate destruction of the histamine-containing neurons in the tuberomammillary (TM) nucleus and bolus i.c.v. infusion of 48/80, a potent mast cell degranulating agent, was used to deplete brain histamine levels. PTD rats receiving combined FMH + 48/80 + TM lesions developed acute neurological symptoms, including spontaneous seizures, approximately 1 day earlier than PTD rats treated with i.c.v. infusion of vehicle and sham lesions of the TM. When examined 1 week after restoration of thiamine, the PTD vehicle + sham lesion animals contained severe neuronal loss and gliosis in midline, intralaminar, ventral, lateral, and posterior nuclei. PTD animals treated with FMH + 48/80 + TM lesions had little evidence of neuronal loss or microglial proliferation in thalamus except in the gelatinosus and anteroventral nuclei, in which there was complete neuronal loss. These data demonstrate a significant and regionally selective role of histamine in the development of thalamic lesions in a rat model of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Furthermore, these data suggest either a dissociation between seizures and thalamic lesions or a significant role of histamine in seizure-related damage to the thalamus."

                "abstract": "Prolonged vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency can lead to neurological disorders such as Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) in humans. These thiamine deficiency disorders have been attributed to vascular leakage, blood-brain barrier breakdown and neuronal loss in the diencephalon and brain stem. However, endothelial dysfunction following thiamine deficiency and its relationship to the phenomenon of neurodegeneration has not been clearly elucidated. The present study sought to begin to address this issue by evaluating vascular morphology and integrity in a pyrithiamine (PT)-induced rat model of thiamine deficiency. Adjacent brain sections were used to either assess vascular integrity through immunohistochemical localization of rat endothelial cell antigen (RECA-1) and endothelial brain barrier antigen (EBA-1) or neurodegeneration using the de Olmos cupric silver method. GFAP and CD11b immunolabeling was used to evaluate astrocytic and microglial/macrophagic changes. Extensive neurodegeneration occurred concomitant with both vascular damage (thinning and breakage) and microglial activation in the inferior olive, medial thalamic area, and medial geniculate nuclei of pyrithiamine treated rats. Likewise, glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), which is mostly expressed in endothelial cells, was also severely decreased in this pyrithiamine induced thiamine deficient rat model. MRI scans of these animals prior to sacrifice show that the pyrithiamine induced thiamine deficient animals have abnormal T2 relaxation values, which are commensurate with, and possibly predictive of, the neurodegeneration and/or endothelial dysfunction subsequently observed histologically in these same animals."

The pathologic lesions in the suckling rats were examined at different times of development. There were distinct changes at 22 days of age, by which time the rats are weaned, and the morphogenesis of the cerebellum is almost completed. Before 22 days of age, there were no pathologic changes except for scattered petechial hemorrhages in the brain. After 22 days of age, acute pathologic changes were observed, in decreasing order of severity, in the vestibular nuclei, inferior olivary nuclei, mammillary body, periventricular gray matter, thalamus, and quadrigeminal plates. The initial changes were swelling of post-synaptic dendrites and distension of the periaxonal space of myelinated axons in the parenchyma and ring-shaped hemorrhages in the perivascular space. Pyrithiamine injections into the offspring of rats fed a thiamine-deficient diet probably induce disturbance of the electrolyte permeability of the neuronal excitable membrane, resulting in swelling of this element. These changes were followed by the filtration of erythrocytes and plasma into the parenchyma and astrocytic swelling, which may be a secondary effect of neuronal changes on the brain vascular permeability."

Microvascular alterations were minimal, even in the most severely affected regions. It is the myelin blisters which give rise to the spongy texture of the neuropil. A similar splitting of myelin has been described in several other experimental encephalopathies, and it is probable that it also occurs in Wernicke's encephalopathy in man."

Wernicke's encephalopathy is described in alcoholism, in hyperemesis gravidarum, and in prolonged IV feeding without vitamin supplementation. METHODS: We report a case of a 66-year-old man undergoing surgery for acute necrotic-hemorrhagic pancreatitis, who presented a Wernicke's syndrome during parenteral nutrition (PN). After surgery, he was treated with infusion of industrial 3-compartment bags, without vitamin supplementation. On the seventh postoperative day, nausea and vomiting began, and 5 days later the patient showed diplopia, ataxia, general muscular stiffness, reduction of osteotendinous reflexes, confusional state, and thrombocytopenia. The magnetic resonance scan evidenced pathologic changes in the medial thalamus, in the third and fourth ventricular floor, in the cerebellar vermis, and in the periaqueductal gray substance. RESULTS: All neurologic signs and platelet blood count gradually normalized after IV supplementation of thiamine, 100 mg daily. The magnetic resonance scan repeated 40 days after the first one was normal. CONCLUSIONS: Our report points out the risk of incorrect procedures in management of industrial 3-compartment bags. Moreover, we suggest that thrombocytopenia may be related to thiamine deficiency."

                "abstract": "Thiamine deficiency in humans is associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) which is characterized neuropathologically by neuronal loss in selective brain regions. Pyrithiamine-induced thiamine-deficiency in the rat results in lesions which are similar in nature and distribution to those seen in human WE. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal loss in thiamine deficiency including, (i) impaired cerebral energy metabolism, (ii) focal lactic acidosis, (iii) NMDA-receptor mediated excitotoxicity and (iv) blood-brain barrier breakdown. WE is difficult to diagnose during life and a large number of cases are missed by routine clinical neurological evaluation. Recently, non-invasive diagnostic procedures such as CT and MRI have been used for the evaluation of acute and chronic WE. Autoradiographic studies reveal that increased densities of binding sites for the astrocytic ligand 3H-PK11195 closely parallel the topographic distribution of reactive gliosis and neuronal loss in selective brain regions of pyrithiamine-induced thiamine-deficient rats. In contrast, binding sites for the neuronal ligand 3H-Ro15-1788 show poor regional correlation with neuronal loss in thiamine deficiency. Both of these ligands are available, and have been used in PET assessment of various disorders in humans. The results of autoradiographic studies suggest that 11C-PK11195 may offer a useful PET ligand for the assessment of brain damage in WE in humans."

                "abstract": "Rhesus monkeys were subjected to one, two, or four periods of thiamine deficiency to determine how the number of deprivation episodes affects the development and progression of neurological and neuropathological changes. Recurrent thiamine deprivation produced all major neurological signs and most of the anatomical lesions found in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Neither the number and gravity of neurological symptoms nor the extent or location of lesions was related to the number of deprivation periods in a simple way. Thus, some structures, such as the inferior colliculus and medial vestibular nuclei, were affected after only one period of deficiency. Other structures, such as the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, were more resistant and exhibited degeneration only after four periods of thiamine deprivation. Severe damage in the basal ganglia was infrequent and was associated with prolonged rather than multiple periods of deprivation. No parenchymal damage was found in the mammillary bodies or mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, suggesting that lesions in these prominent sites of damage in Wernicke-Korsakoff disease develop only in the most advanced stages of thiamine deprivation. As a consequence of individual differences in susceptibility to thiamine deficiency, neurological symptoms and signs were more related to the profile of neural damage than to the number or duration of deprivation episodes."

                "abstract": "The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a neuropathological term which encompasses two clinical syndromes in thiamine-deficient alcoholics, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterised by eye and gait disorders and mental confusion, and can lead to the profound and permanent amnesia known as Korsakoff's psychosis. Despite this specific difference, both conditions appear to have identical neuropathology with haemorrhages and other lesions around the ventricular system. The memory deficit has been attributed to a number of brain lesions, including a recent suggestion that brain pathways utilising particular neurotransmitters are specifically damaged. To examine this, the number of chemically identified neurons in particular brain regions was quantified in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy alone or in combination with Korsakoff's psychosis and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Noradrenaline, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in the process of selective attention, is localised in pathways projecting to the cortex. Our patients with either Wernicke's encephalopathy or additional Korsakoff's psychosis do not differ from controls in the distribution and number of these cells. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter that has been linked with alcohol dependency. Both patient groups have a profound loss of serotonin-containing neurons compared with controls. The loss of forebrain neurons containing acetylcholine in patients with Alzheimer's disease has implicated this neurotransmitter in the maintenance of memory functions. There was a large variation in the number of these forebrain neurons in thiamine-deficient alcoholics compared with controls. Cholinergic cell loss reflected the severity of cognitive dysfunction, but was not exclusive to patients with amnesia. Two thalamic nuclei are involved in relaying memories for storage and retrieval, the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. While patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy often had neuronal loss in the mediodorsal nucleus, only patients with Korsakoff's psychosis had cell loss in both medial thalamic nuclei. The results suggest that cumulative lesions contribute to the amnesia seen in thiamine-deficient alcoholics, including deficits in serotonergic, cholinergic and medial thalamic pathways."

            "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major concern in drug development and clinical drug therapy. Since the underlying mechanisms of DILI have not been fully understood in most cases, elucidation of the hepatotoxic mechanisms of drugs is expected. Although enalapril (ELP), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, has been reported to cause liver injuries with a low incidence in humans, the precise mechanisms by which ELP causes liver injury remains unknown. In this study, we established a mouse model of ELP-induced liver injury and analyzed the mechanisms of its hepatotoxicity. Mice that were administered ELP alone did not develop liver injury, and mice that were pretreated with a synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) and a glutathione synthesis inhibitor l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) exhibited liver steatosis without significant increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In mice pretreated with DEX and BSO, ALT levels were significantly increased after ELP administration, suggesting that hepatic steatosis sensitized the liver to ELP hepatotoxicity. An immunohistochemical analysis showed that the numbers of myeloperoxidase-positive cells that infiltrated the liver were significantly increased in the mice administered DEX/BSO/ELP. The levels of oxidative stress-related factors, including hepatic heme oxygenase-1, serum hydrogen peroxide and hepatic malondialdehyde, were elevated in the mice administered DEX/BSO/ELP. The involvement of oxidative stress in ELP-induced liver injury was further supported by the observation that tempol, an antioxidant agent, ameliorated ELP-induced liver injury. In conclusion, we successfully established a model of ELP-induced liver injury in DEX-treated steatotic mice and demonstrated that oxidative stress and neutrophil infiltration are involved in the pathogenesis of ELP-induced liver injury."

Phenytoin (DPH) is an anticonvulsant drug that is widely used for the treatment of epilepsy. Some patients who are administered DPH will suffer symptoms of drug-induced liver injury characterized by hepatic necrosis. DPH-induced liver injury occurs in 1 in 1000 or 1 in 10 000 patients. Clinically, 75% of patients who develop liver injury develop a fever and 63% develop a rash. In this study, we established a mouse model for DPH-induced liver injury and analyzed the mechanisms for hepatotoxicity in the presence of immune-related or inflammation-related factors and metabolic activation. Female C57BL/6 mice were administered DPH for 5 days in combination with L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine. Then, the plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were increased, hepatic lesions were observed during the histological evaluations, the hepatic glutathione levels were significantly reduced, and the oxidative stress marker levels were significantly increased. The inhibition of cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative metabolism significantly suppressed the elevated plasma ALT levels and depleted hepatic glutathione. Among the innate immune factors, the hepatic mRNA levels of NACHT, LRR, pyrin domain-containing protein 3, interleukin-1\u03b2, and damage-associated molecular patterns were significantly increased. Prostaglandin E\u2081 treatment ameliorated the hepatic injury caused by DPH. In conclusion, cytochrome P450-dependent metabolic activation followed by the stimulation of the innate immune responses is involved in DPH-induced liver injury."

                "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of post-marketing warnings and withdrawals. Amiodarone (AMD), an antiarrhythmic, presents a risk of liver injury in humans, and its metabolites, formed by cytochrome P450 3A4, are likely more toxic to hepatocytes than AMD is. However, it remains to be clarified whether the metabolic activation of AMD is involved in liver injury in vivo. In this study, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of AMD-induced liver injury, mice were administered AMD [1000\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1), per os (p.o.)] after pretreatment with dexamethasone [DEX, 60\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1), intraperitoneal (i.p.)], which induces P450 expression, once daily for 3\u2009days. The plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly increased by AMD administration in the DEX-pretreated mice, and the liver concentrations of desethylamiodarone (DEA), a major metabolite of AMD, were correlated with the changes in the plasma ALT levels. Cytochrome c release into the hepatic cytosol and triglyceride levels in the plasma were increased in DEX plus AMD-administered mice. Furthermore, the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide in the liver significantly decreased in the DEX plus AMD-administered mice. The increase of ALT levels was suppressed by treatment with gadolinium chloride (GdCl3 ), which is an inhibitor of Kupffer cell function. From these results, it is suggested that AMD and/or DEA contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD-induced liver injury by producing mitochondrial and oxidative stress and Kupffer cell activation. This study proposes the mechanisms of AMD-induced liver injury using an in vivo mouse model."

                "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major safety concern in drug development and clinical practice. The pathogenesis of DILI usually involves the participation of the parent drug or metabolites that either affect cellular function or elicit an immune response. However, the mechanisms leading to DILI are unknown in most cases. Methimazole (MTZ) is used as an antithyroid drug and is well known to have induced liver injuries such as cholestatic hepatitis in a small number of human cases. Immune-mediated reactions were also suggested to play a role in MTZ-induced acute liver injury, but the mechanism underlying this process has not been elucidated. To address this issue, we measured plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, hepatic glutathione levels, hepatic expression of CD4\u207a Th cell-related transcriptional factors, cytokines and chemokines, plasma interleukin (IL)-4 levels and histopathological changes in the liver following MTZ (450\u2009mg\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9 , p.o.) administration in mice. The hepatic expression of mRNA for Th2 cell-related factors, such as GATA-binding protein, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and plasma IL-4 levels, as well as plasma AST and ALT levels, was significantly increased in mice treated with MTZ. These changes were markedly enhanced by pre-treatment with L-buthionine sulfoximine (3\u2009mmol\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9, i.p.) and MTZ (15\u2009mg\u2009kg\u207b\u00b9, p.o.). Neutralization of IL-4 using a monoclonal anti-mouse IL-4 antibody (100\u2009\u00b5g/mouse, single i.p.) suppressed the hepatotoxic effect of MTZ. In conclusion, this report is the first to demonstrate that Th2 cytokine-mediated immune responses are involved in MTZ-induced acute liver injury in mice."

The coadministration of BSO and GEF increased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels to approximately 700 U/L and 1600 U/L at 72 and 96 hr after the first administration, respectively, whereas the increase in plasma ALT levels in mice receiving GEF at 500 mg/kg alone was limited, suggesting that GSH plays a protective role in GEF-induced liver injury. Histological examination showed nuclear karyorrhexis and sporadic single hepatocyte death in the livers of BSO+GEF coadministered mice. In these mice, the hepatic expression levels of heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) and metallothionein 2 (Mt2) mRNA, caspase 3/7 enzymatic activity, and the amounts of 2-thiobarbiuric acid reactive substances were significantly increased, suggesting the presence of oxidative stress, which may be associated with hepatocellular death. Together, these results show that oxidative stress as well as the reactive metabolites of GEF are involved in GEF-induced liver injury in GSH-depleted mice."

                "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury is a major safety concern in drug development and clinical pharmacotherapy; however, advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury are hampered by the lack of animal models. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a widely used antiepileptic agent. Although the drug is generally well tolerated, only a small number of patients prescribed CBZ develop severe hepatitis. In the present study, we developed a mouse model of CBZ-induced liver injury and elucidated the mechanisms accounting for the hepatotoxicity of CBZ. Male BALB/c mice were orally administered CBZ for 5 days. The plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were prominently increased, and severe liver damage was observed via histological evaluation. The analysis of the plasma concentration of CBZ and its metabolites demonstrated that 3-hydroxy CBZ may be relevant in CBZ-induced liver injury. The hepatic glutathione levels were significantly decreased, and oxidative stress markers were significantly altered. Mechanistic investigations found that hepatic mRNA levels of toll-like receptor 4, receptor for advanced glycation end products, and their ligands were significantly increased. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines were also increased. Prostaglandin E(1) administration ameliorated the hepatic injury caused by CBZ. In conclusion, metabolic activation followed by the stimulation of immune responses was demonstrated to be involved in CBZ-induced liver injury in mice."

                "abstract": "Lamotrigine (LTG) has been widely prescribed as an antipsychotic drug, although it causes idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury in humans. LTG is mainly metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, while LTG undergoes bioactivation by cytochrome P450 to a reactive metabolite; it is subsequently conjugated with glutathione, suggesting that reactive metabolite would be one of the causes for LTG-induced liver injury. However, there is little information regarding the mechanism of LTG-induced liver injury in both humans and rodents. In this study, we established an LTG-induced liver injury mouse model through co-administration with LTG and a glutathione synthesis inhibitor, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine. We found an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (>10\u00a0000\u00a0U/L) in C57BL/6J mice, with apparent interindividual differences. On the other hand, a drastic increase in ALT was not noted in BALB/c mice, suggesting that the initiation mechanism would be different between the two strains. To examine the cause of interindividual differences, C57BL/6J mice that were co-administered LTG and l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine were categorized into three groups based on ALT values: no-responder (ALT <100\u00a0U/L), low-responder (100\u00a0U/L\u00a0<\u00a0ALT\u00a0<\u00a01000\u00a0U/L) and high-responder (ALT >1000\u00a0U/L). In the high-responder group, induction of hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules in mRNA was associated with vacuolation and karyorrhexis in hepatocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that LTG showed apparent strain and interindividual differences in liver injuries from the aspects of initiation and exacerbation mechanisms. These results would support interpretation of the mechanism of LTG-induced liver injury observed in humans."

                "abstract": "Carbamazepine (CBZ) is widely used as an antiepileptic agent and causes rare but severe liver injury in humans. It has been generally recognized that reactive metabolites formed via the metabolic activation reaction contribute to the onset of liver injuries by several drugs. However, the role of CBZ metabolism in the development of liver injury is not fully understood. In this study, we developed a novel rat model of CBZ-induced liver injury and attempted to elucidate the associated mechanisms by focusing on the metabolism of CBZ. The repeated administration of CBZ for 5 days in combination with l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione (GSH) synthesis inhibitor, resulted in increases in the plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and centrilobular necrosis in the liver that were observed in various degrees. The CBZ and 2-hydroxy-CBZ concentrations in the plasma after the last CBZ administration were lower in the rats with high plasma ALT levels compared with those with normal plasma ALT levels, showing the possibility that the further metabolism of CBZ and/or 2-hydroxy-CBZ is associated with the liver injury. Although a single administration of CBZ did not affect the plasma ALT levels, even when cotreated with BSO, pretreatment with dexamethasone, a CYP3A inducer, increased the plasma ALT levels. In addition, the rats cotreated with troleandomycin or ketoconazole, CYP3A inhibitors, suppressed the increased plasma ALT levels. In conclusion, reactive metabolite(s) of CBZ produced by CYP3A under the GSH-depleted condition might be involved in the development of liver injury in rats. "

                "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury is a major problem in drug development and clinical drug therapy. Troglitazone (TGZ), a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, was found to induce rare idiosyncratic severe liver injury in patients, which led to its withdrawal in 2000. However, in normal experimental animals in vivo TGZ has never induced liver injury. To explore TGZ hepatotoxic mechanism, we established a novel mouse model of TGZ-induced liver injury. Administration of BALB/c female mice with a single intraperitoneal TGZ dose (300\u00a0mg/kg) significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels 6\u00a0hours after the treatment. The ratio of oxidative stress marker glutathione/disulfide glutathione was significantly decreased. The increased hepatic mRNA levels of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related factors were observed in TGZ-treated mice. Subsequently, hepatic transcriptome profiles of TGZ-exposed liver were compared with those of non-hepatotoxic rosiglitazone. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway was activated in TGZ-induced liver injury. The activation of the JAK/STAT pathway promoted phosphorylation of STAT3 in TGZ-treated mice. Consequently, upregulation of STAT3 activation increased mRNA levels of its downstream genes. In conclusion, a single intraperitoneal dose of TGZ exposure could induce liver injury in BALB/c female mice and, by a hepatic transcriptomic analysis, we found that the activation of JAK/STAT pathway might be related to TGZ-induced hepatotoxicity."

                "abstract": "The effects of modulators of cytochrome P450 and reduced glutathione (GSH) on the hepatotoxicity of enalapril maleate (EN) were investigated in Fischer 344 rats. Twenty-four hours following the administration of EN (1.5 to 1.8 g/kg), increased serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and hepatic necrosis were observed. Pretreatment of the animals with pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, a selective inducer of the cytochrome P450IIIA gene subfamily, enhanced EN-induced hepatotoxicity, whereas pretreatment with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, cobalt protoporphyrin, reduced the liver injury. Depletion of hepatic non-protein sulfhydryls (NPSHs), an indicator of GSH, by combined treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) produced marked elevations in serum transaminases by 6 hr after EN treatment. Administered on its own, EN decreased hepatic NPSH content and when combined with the BSO/DEM pretreatment, the liver was nearly completely devoid of NPSHs. Protection from EN-induced hepatotoxicity was observed in animals administered L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a cysteine precursor. Together, these observations suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450 in EN bioactivation and GSH in detoxification. The results corroborate previous in vitro observations pertaining to the mechanism of EN-induced cytotoxicity towards primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Although the doses of EN used in this study were far in excess of therapeutic doses, under certain circumstances, this metabolism-mediated toxicologic mechanism could form the basis for idiosyncratic liver injury in patients receiving EN therapy."

                "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is one of the most common inducements of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in the world. The main purpose of this paper was to investigate the liver protection activity of saponins (ginsenosides) from the leaves of Panax quinquefolius (PQS) against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, and the involved mechanisms were demonstrated for the first time. Mice were pretreated with PQS (150 and 300 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 7 days before being treated with 250 mg/kg APAP. Severe liver injury was exerted at 24 h post-APAP, and hepatotoxicity was assessed. Our results showed that pretreatment with PQS significantly decreased the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) levels in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the APAP administration. Meanwhile, compared with that in the APAP group, PQS decreased hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) expression and restored reduced glutathione (GSH) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in livers of mice. PQS inhibited the overexpression of pro-inflammatory factors cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the liver tissues. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis revealed that PQS pretreatment inhibited the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways via increase of Bcl-2 and decrease of Bax and caspase-3 protein expression levels. Liver histopathological observation provided further evidence that PQS pretreatment significantly inhibited APAP-induced hepatocyte necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and congestion. Biological indicators of nitrative stress such as 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) were inhibited after PQS pretreatment, compared to the APAP group. The present study clearly demonstrates that PQS exerts a protective effect against APAP-induced hepatic injury because of its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. The findings from the present investigation show that PQS might be a promising candidate treatment agent against drug-induced ALI."

The aim of this study was to investigate if SNMC had an anti-oxidative effect, as oxidative stress has been proposed to be one of the mechanisms of liver injury in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated chronic liver diseases. METHODS: The protective effect of SNMC against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury was examined using transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein. RESULTS: A small dose of CCl4 (10 microl/kg of body weight) significantly increased the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and hepatic malondialdehyde content, decreased hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content and induced ultrastructural alterations of hepatic mitochondria in transgenic mice, but not in nontransgenic mice. A single SNMC treatment equivalent to a clinical dose significantly restored the serum ALT level and hepatic malondialdehyde and GSH contents, attenuated the ultrastructural alterations of hepatic mitochondria, and increased mRNA expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS). CONCLUSIONS: Transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein are abnormally vulnerable to oxidative stress. SNMC protects hepatocytes against CCl4-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury in the presence of HCV proteins by restoring depleted cellular GSH."

However, acyl glucuronides (AGs) have been implicated in the toxicity of carboxylic acid drugs due to their electrophilic reactivity. Zomepirac (ZP) was withdrawn from the market because of adverse effects such as renal toxicity. Although ZP is mainly metabolized to acyl glucuronide (ZP-AG) by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, the role of ZP-AG in renal toxicity is unknown. In this study, we established a ZP-induced kidney injury mouse model by pretreatment with tri-o-tolyl phosphate (TOTP), a nonselective esterase inhibitor, and l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione synthesis inhibitor. The role of ZP-AG in renal toxicity was investigated using this model. The model showed significant increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CRE), but not alanine aminotransferase. The ZP-AG concentrations were elevated by cotreatment with TOTP in the plasma and liver and especially in the kidney. The ZP-AG concentrations in the kidney correlated with values for BUN and CRE. Upon histopathological examination, vacuoles and infiltration of mononuclear cells were observed in the model mouse. In addition to immune-related responses, oxidative stress markers, such as the glutathione/disulfide glutathione ratio and malondialdehyde levels, were different in the mouse model. The suppression of ZP-induced kidney injury by tempol, an antioxidant agent, suggested the involvement of oxidative stress in ZP-induced kidney injury. This is the first study to demonstrate that AG accumulation in the kidney by TOTP and BSO treatment could explain renal toxicity and to show the in vivo toxicological potential of AGs."

Acute liver injury was induced by CCl(4) intoxication in mice. Serum biological analysis, lipid peroxides and antioxidant estimation, histopathological studies, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay were carried out. CCl(4) treatment resulted in severe hepatic injury, as evidenced by significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and typical histopathological changes, such as hepatocyte necrosis. Additionally, CCl(4) administration led to oxidative stress in mice, as indicated by a remarkable increase in the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level, together with a significant decrease in liver reduced glutathione (GSH) content. However, CCl(4)-induced hepatotoxicity was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with AP, as demonstrated by significant reduction of serum ALT, AST levels and hepatic MDA activity, along with a remarkable increase in hepatic GSH content. Histopathological changes induced by CCl(4) were also ameliorated by AP pretreatment. The marked increase of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) induced by CCl(4) was attenuated by AP, and the dramatic elevation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) at transcriptional and protein levels was augmented following AP pretreatment. AP can effectively prevent liver injury induced by CCl(4), which may be due to inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses."

It has been demonstrated that MTZ-induced liver injury in Balb/c mice is accompanied by T helper (Th) 2 cytokine-mediated immune responses; however, there is little evidence for immune responses associated with MTZ-induced liver injury in rats. To investigate species differences in MTZ-induced liver injury, we administered MTZ with a glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor, L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), to F344 rats and subsequently observed an increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which are associated with hepatic lesions. The hepatic mRNA expression of innate immune-related genes significantly increased in BSO- and MTZ-treated rats, but the change in Th2-related genes was not much greater than the change observed in the previous mouse study. Moreover, an increase in Kupffer cells and an induction of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins were accompanied by an increase in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, indicating that Kupffer cell activation occurs through HMGB1-TLR4 signaling. To elucidate the mechanism of liver injury in rats, gadolinium chloride, which inactivates the function of Kupffer cells, was administered before BSO and MTZ administration. The gadolinium chloride treatment significantly suppressed the increased ALT, which was accompanied by decreased hepatic mRNA expression related to innate immune responses and ERK/JNK phosphorylation. In conclusion, Kupffer cell-mediated immune responses are crucial factors for the exacerbation of MTZ-induced liver injury in rats, indicating apparent species differences in the immune-mediated exacerbation of liver injury between mice and rats."

Adverse effects of TMX include hepatotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of osthole, isolated from medicinal plants especially Fructus Cnidii, on TMX-induced acute liver injury in mice. Mice were injected with osthole (100\u2009mg/kg, ip) or vehicle, followed by TMX (90\u2009mg/kg, ip) 24\u2009h later. We showed that a single injection of TMX-induced liver injury and oxidative stress. Pretreatment with osthole attenuated TMX-induced liver injury evidenced by dose-dependent reduction of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Pretreatment with osthole also blunted TMX-induced oxidative stress, evidenced by significant increase of reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consistently, osthole significantly enhanced the expressions of antioxidant genes (GPX1, SOD2, GCL-c, and G6pdh), but suppressed those of pro-oxidant genes (NOX2 and ACOX). Furthermore, osthole inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines, reduced the metabolic activation of TMX, and promoted its clearance. We further revealed that osthole elevated hepatic cAMP and cGMP levels, but inhibition of PKA or PKG failed to abolish the hepatoprotective effect of osthole. Meanwhile, prominent phosphorylation of p38 was observed in liver in response to TMX, which was significantly inhibited by osthole. Pretreatment with SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, significantly attenuated TMX-induced increase of ALT and AST activities, reduced oxidative stress, and reversed the alterations of gene expression caused by TMX. Moreover, pretreatment with L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, partly reversed the effect of osthole on TMX-induced liver injury. Consistently, pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated TMX-induced increase in ALT and AST activities. Notably, both BSO and NAC had no detectable effect on the phosphorylation levels of p38. Collectively, our results suggest that osthole prevents TMX hepatotoxicity by suppressing p38 activation and subsequently reducing TMX-induced oxidative damage."

Its prediction and prevention have been hindered by limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, in part the result of a lack of animal models. We developed a mouse model of halothane-induced liver injury and characterized the mechanisms accounting for tissue damage. Female and male Balb/c, DBA/1, and C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with halothane. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and histology were evaluated to determine liver injury. Balb/c mice were found to be the most susceptible strain, followed by DBA/1, with no significant hepatotoxicity observed in C57BL/6J mice. Female Balb/c and DBA/1 mice developed more severe liver damage compared with their male counterparts. Bioactivation of halothane occurred similarly in all three strains based on detection of liver proteins adducted by the reactive metabolite. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hepatic message levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta); IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly higher in halothane-treated Balb/c mice compared to DBA/1 and C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, a higher number of neutrophils were recruited into the liver of Balb/c mice upon halothane treatment compared with DBA/1, with no obvious neutrophil infiltration detected in C57BL/6J mice. Neutrophil depletion experiments demonstrated a crucial role for these cells in the development of halothane-induced liver injury. The halothane-initiated hepatotoxicity and innate immune response-mediated escalation of tissue damage are consistent with events that occur in many cases of DILI. In conclusion, our model provides a platform for elucidating strain-based and gender-based susceptibility factors in DILI development."

Although sole administration of either AQ or L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoxinine (BSO), a well-known GSH synthesis inhibitor, produced no significant hepatotoxicity, combined administration of AQ with BSO induced hepatotoxicity characterized by centrilobular necrosis of the hepatocytes and an elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase activity.

CYP2E1 plays a role in the mechanisms by which ethanol generates oxidative stress, fatty liver, and liver injury. This study evaluated whether CYP2E1 contributes to ethanol-induced hypoxia and activation of HIF-1\u03b1 in vivo and whether HIF-1\u03b1 protects against or promotes CYP2E1-dependent toxicity in vitro. Wild-type (WT), CYP2E1-knock-in (KI), and CYP2E1 knockout (KO) mice were fed ethanol chronically; pair-fed controls received isocaloric dextrose. Ethanol produced liver injury in the KI mice to a much greater extent than in the WT and KO mice. Protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and downstream targets of HIF-1\u03b1 activation were elevated in the ethanol-fed KI mice compared to the WT and KO mice. Levels of HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2, which promotes HIF-1\u03b1 degradation, were decreased in the ethanol-fed KI mice in association with the increases in HIF-1\u03b1. Hypoxia occurred in the ethanol-fed CYP2E1 KI mice as shown by an increased area of staining using the hypoxia-specific marker pimonidazole. Hypoxia was lower in the ethanol-fed WT mice and lowest in the ethanol-fed KO mice and all the dextrose-fed mice. In situ double staining showed that pimonidazole and CYP2E1 were colocalized to the same area of injury in the hepatic centrilobule. Increased protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 were also found after acute ethanol treatment of KI mice. Treatment of HepG2 E47 cells, which express CYP2E1, with ethanol plus arachidonic acid (AA) or ethanol plus buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depletes glutathione, caused loss of cell viability to a greater extent than in HepG2 C34 cells, which do not express CYP2E1. These treatments elevated protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 to a greater extent in E47 cells than in C34 cells. 2-Methoxyestradiol, an inhibitor of HIF-1\u03b1, blunted the toxic effects of ethanol plus AA and ethanol plus BSO in the E47 cells in association with inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1. The HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor also blocked the elevated oxidative stress produced by ethanol/AA or ethanol/BSO in the E47 cells. These results suggest that CYP2E1 plays a role in ethanol-induced hypoxia, oxidative stress, and activation of HIF-1\u03b1 and that HIF-1\u03b1 contributes to CYP2E1-dependent ethanol-induced toxicity. Blocking HIF-1\u03b1 activation and actions may have therapeutic implications for protection against ethanol/CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress, steatosis, and liver injury. "

                "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose causes severe liver and kidney damage. APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) represents the most frequent cause of drug-induced liver failure. APAP is relatively insoluble and can only be taken orally; however, its prodrug, propacetamol, is water soluble and usually injected directly. In this study, we examined the time-dependent effects of AILI after propacetamol injection in mice. After analyses of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and liver histopathology, we demonstrated that a novel AILI mouse model can be established by single propacetamol injection. Furthermore, we compared the protective and therapeutic effects of galangin with a known liver protective extract, silymarin, and the only clinical agent for treating APAP toxicity, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), at the same dose in the model mice. We observed that galangin and silymarin were more effective than NAC for protecting against AILI. However, only NAC greatly improved both the survival time and rate consequent to a lethal dose of propacetamol. To decipher the hepatic protective mechanism(s) of galangin, galangin pretreatment significantly decreased the hepatic oxidative stress, increased hepatic glutathione level, and decreased hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 levels induced by propacetamol injection. In addition, propacetamol injection also reproduced the probability of APAP-induced kidney injury (AIKI), appearing similar to a clinical APAP overdose. Only galangin pretreatment showed the protective effect of AIKI. Thus, we have established a novel mouse model for AILI and AIKI using a single propacetamol injection. We also demonstrated that galangin provides significant protection against AILI and AIKI in this mouse model."

            "abstract": "Despite a growing acceptance that withdrawal symptoms can emerge following discontinuation of cannabis products, especially in high-intake chronic users, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options. Drug development has been hampered by difficulties studying cannabis withdrawal in laboratory animals. One preclinical approach that has been effective in studying withdrawal from drugs in several pharmacological classes is antagonist drug discrimination. The present studies were designed to examine this paradigm in squirrel monkeys treated daily with the long-acting CB1 agonist AM2389 (0.01 mg/kg) and trained to discriminate the CB1 inverse agonist/antagonist rimonabant (0.3 mg/kg) from saline. The discriminative-stimulus effects of rimonabant were both dose and time dependent and, importantly, could be reproduced by discontinuation of agonist treatment. Antagonist substitution tests with the CB1 neutral antagonists AM4113 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), AM6527 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), and AM6545 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) confirmed that the rimonabant discriminative stimulus also could be reproduced by CB1 antagonists lacking inverse agonist action. Agonist substitution tests with the phytocannabinoid \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), synthetic CB1 agonists nabilone (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), AM4054 (0.01-0.03 mg/kg), K2/Spice compound JWH-018 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), FAAH-selective inhibitors AM3506 (0.3-5.6 mg/kg), URB597 (3.0-5.6 mg/kg), and nonselective FAAH/MGL inhibitor AM4302 (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) revealed that only agonists with CB1 affinity were able to reduce the rimonabant-like discriminative stimulus effects of withholding daily agonist treatment. Although the present studies did not document physiologic disturbances associated with withdrawal, the results are consistent with the view that the cannabinoid antagonist drug discrimination paradigm provides a useful screening procedure for examining the ability of candidate medications to attenuate the interoceptive stimuli provoked by cannabis discontinuation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite a growing acceptance that withdrawal symptoms can emerge following the discontinuation of cannabis products, especially in high-intake chronic users, there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies to assist those seeking treatment. The present studies systematically examined cannabinoid antagonist drug discrimination, a preclinical animal model that is designed to appraise the ability of candidate medications to attenuate the interoceptive effects that accompany abrupt cannabis abstinence."

                "title": "Cannabinoid withdrawal in mice: inverse agonist vs neutral antagonist.",
                "abstract": "RATIONALE: Previous reports shows rimonabant's inverse properties may be a limiting factor for treating cannabinoid dependence. To overcome this limitation, neutral antagonists were developed, to address mechanisms by which an inverse agonist and neutral antagonist elicit withdrawal. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to introduce an animal model to study cannabinoid dependence by incorporating traditional methodologies and profiling novel cannabinoid ligands with distinct pharmacological properties/modes of action by evaluating their pharmacological effects on CB1-receptor (CB1R) related physiological/behavioral endpoints. METHODS: The cannabinergic AM2389 was acutely characterized in the tetrad (locomotor activity, analgesia, inverted screen/catalepsy bar test, and temperature), with some comparisons made to \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Tolerance was measured in mice repeatedly administered AM2389. Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal was characterized in cannabinoid-adapted mice induced by either centrally acting antagonists, rimonabant and AM4113, or an antagonist with limited brain penetration, AM6545. RESULTS: In the tetrad, AM2389 was more potent and longer acting than THC, suggesting a novel approach for inducing dependence. Repeated administration of AM2389 led to tolerance by attenuating hypothermia that was induced by acute AM2389 administration. Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal signs were induced by rimonabant or AM4113, but not by AM6545. Antagonist-precipitated withdrawal was reversed by reinstating AM2389 or THC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest cannabinoid-precipitated withdrawal may not be ascribed to the inverse properties of rimonabant, but rather to rapid competition with the agonist at the CB1R. This withdrawal syndrome is likely centrally mediated, since only the centrally acting CB1R antagonists elicited withdrawal, i.e., such responses were absent after the purported peripherally selective CB1R antagonist AM6545."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabinoids may be useful in the treatment of CNS disorders including drug abuse and addiction, where both CB1R antagonists / inverse agonists and CB2R agonists have shown preclinical efficacy. TV-5-249 and TV-6-41, two novel aminoalkylindoles with dual action as neutral CB1R antagonists and CB2R agonists, previously attenuated abuse-related effects of ethanol in mice. PURPOSE: To further characterize these drugs, TV-5-249 and TV-6-41 were compared with the CB1R antagonist / inverse agonist rimonabant in assays relevant to adverse effects and cannabinoid withdrawal. PROCEDURES AND FINDINGS: The cannabinoid tetrad confirmed that TV-5-249 and TV-6-41 were devoid of CB1R agonist effects at behaviorally-relevant doses, and neither of the novel drugs induced rimonabant-like scratching. Generalized aversive effects were assessed, and rimonabant and TV-5-249 induced taste aversion, but TV-6-41 did not. Schedule-controlled responding and observation of somatic signs were used to assess withdrawal-like effects precipitated by rimonabant or TV-6-41 in mice previously treated with the high-efficacy CB1R agonist JWH-018 or vehicle. Rimonabant and TV-6-41 dose-dependently suppressed response rates in all subjects, but TV-6-41 did so more potently in JWH-018-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice, while rimonabant equally suppressed responding in both groups. Importantly, rimonabant elicited dramatic withdrawal signs, but TV-6-41 did not. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest differences in both direct adverse effects and withdrawal-related effects elicited by rimonabant, TV-5-249, and TV-6-41, which could relate to neutral CB1R antagonism, CB2R agonism, or a combination of both. Both mechanisms should be explored and exploited in future drug design efforts to develop pharmacotherapies for drug dependence."

                "abstract": "Evidence suggests the existence of a functional interaction between endogenous cannabinoid (CB) and opioid systems. Thus, targeting CB1 receptors might be a viable approach to develop new medications for opioid use disorders (OUD). The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the effects of the neutral CB1 antagonist AM4113 and the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant in male rats trained to discriminate 0.032\u00a0mg/kg fentanyl from saline under a 10-response fixed-ratio (FR-10) schedule of food reinforcement. Results show that the \u00b5-opioid agonists (fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine) substituted fully and dose-dependently for fentanyl, whereas pretreatment with the \u00b5-opioid antagonist naltrexone antagonized fentanyl's discriminative-stimulus effects. In interaction studies, AM4113 (0.32 or 1.0\u00a0mg/kg) was more effective in blocking fentanyl discrimination at 10-fold lower doses that did not modify rates of food-maintained responding, whereas rimonabant (1.0-10\u00a0mg/kg) produced some attenuation of fentanyl's discriminative-stimulus effects at the highest dose tested which also significantly decreased response rates. These results extend our recent work showing that AM4113 can effectively block the behavioral effects of heroin without producing rimonabant-like adverse effects. Taken together, these data suggests that CB1 neutral antagonists effectively block the behavioral effects of structurally distinct morphinan (heroin) and phenylpiperidine-based (fentanyl) opioids and may provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of OUD."

                "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB(1)) inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant) have been reported to produce adverse effects including nausea, emesis, and anhedonia that limit their clinical applications. Recent laboratory studies suggest that the effects of CB(1) neutral antagonists differ from those of such inverse agonists, raising the possibility of improved clinical utility. However, little is known regarding the antagonist properties of neutral antagonists. In the present studies, the CB(1) inverse agonist SR141716A (rimonabant) and the CB(1) neutral antagonist AM4113 were compared for their ability to modify CB(1) receptor-mediated discriminative stimulus effects in nonhuman primates trained to discriminate the novel CB(1) full agonist AM4054. Results indicate that AM4054 serves as an effective CB(1) discriminative stimulus, with an onset and time course of action comparable with that of the CB(1) agonist \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and that the inverse agonist rimonabant and the neutral antagonist AM4113 produce dose-related rightward shifts in the AM4054 dose-effect curve, indicating that both drugs surmountably antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of AM4054. Schild analyses further show that rimonabant and AM4113 produce highly similar antagonist effects, as evident in comparable pA(2) values (6.9). Taken together with previous studies, the present data suggest that the improved safety profile suggested for CB(1) neutral antagonists over inverse agonists is not accompanied by a loss of antagonist action at CB(1) receptors."

                "abstract": "Cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) have been shown to be a promising target in medication development for the treatment of addiction. However, clinical trials with SR141716A (rimonabant, a selective CB1R antagonist/inverse agonist) for the treatment of obesity and smoking cessation failed due to unwanted side effects, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. Recent preclinical studies suggest that the neutral CB1R antagonist AM4113 may retain the therapeutic anti-addictive effects of SR141716A in nicotine self-administration models and possibly has fewer unwanted side effects. However, little is known about whether AM4113 is also effective for other drugs of abuse, such as opioids and psychostimulants, and whether it produces depressive side effects similar to SR141716A in experimental animals. In this study, we demonstrated that systemic administration of AM4113 (3 and 10\u2009mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the self-administration of intravenous heroin but not cocaine or methamphetamine, whereas SR141716A (3 and 10\u2009mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the self-administration of heroin and methamphetamine but not cocaine. In the electrical brain-stimulation reward (BSR) paradigm, SR141716A (3 and 10\u2009mg/kg) dose-dependently increased the BSR stimulation threshold (i.e., decreased the stimulation reward), but AM4113 had no effect on BSR at the same doses, suggesting that SR141716A may produce aversive effects while AM4113 may not. Together, these findings show that neutral CB1R antagonists such as AM4113 deserve further research as a new class of CB1R-based medications for the treatment of opioid addiction without SR141716A-like aversive effects."

                "abstract": "Substance use disorder (SUD) is a major public health crisis worldwide, and effective treatment options are limited. During the past 2\u00a0decades, researchers have investigated the impact of a variety of pharmacological approaches to treat SUD, one of which is the use of medical cannabis or cannabinoids. Significant progress was made with the discovery of rimonabant, a selective CB1 receptor (CB1R) antagonist (also an inverse agonist), as a promising therapeutic for SUDs and obesity. However, serious adverse effects such as depression and suicidality led to the withdrawal of rimonabant (and almost all other CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists) from clinical trials worldwide in 2008. Since then, much research interest has shifted to other cannabinoid-based strategies, such as peripheral CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists, neutral CB1R antagonists, allosteric CB1R modulators, CB2R agonists, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors, fatty acid binding protein (FABP) inhibitors, or nonaddictive phytocannabinoids with CB1R or CB2R-binding profiles, as new therapeutics for SUDs. In this article, we first review recent progress in research regarding the endocannabinoid systems, cannabis reward versus aversion, and the underlying receptor mechanisms. We then review recent progress in cannabinoid-based medication development for the treatment of SUDs. As evidence continues to accumulate, neutral CB1R antagonists (such as AM4113), CB2R agonists (JWH133, Xie2-64), and nonselective phytocannabinoids (cannabidiol, \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u22069-tetrahydrocannabivarin) have shown great therapeutic potential for SUDs, as shown in experimental animals. Several cannabinoid-based medications (e.g., dronabinol, nabilone, PF-04457845) that entered clinical trials have shown promising results in reducing withdrawal symptoms in cannabis and opioid users."

                "abstract": "Cannabis is the most frequently used federally illicit substance in the United States. However, there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies to mitigate the withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation in heavy users. A promising, readily available, non-cannabinoid therapy are the gabapentinoids. Although currently approved for epilepsy and neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids are increasingly used for their \"off-label\" efficacy in treating various psychiatric conditions and substance abuse. Gabapentin (GBP) synergizes with cannabinoid agonism in neuropathic pain models, substitutes for \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in drug discrimination procedures, and reduced withdrawal symptoms in an outpatient clinical trial. However, there are limited data on the biological plausibility of the therapeutic action of gabapentinoids in cannabinoid withdrawal in preclinical models. The purpose of the current study was to determine the efficacy of GBP on attenuating THC withdrawal in mice, using an array of tests targeting withdrawal-induced and withdrawal-suppressed behaviors. Separate cohorts of male and female mice were administered THC (10\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle for 5.5 days, and withdrawal was precipitated by the CB1 antagonist rimonabant (2 or 3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) on the sixth day. GBP (\u226510\u00a0mg/kg) reduced somatic signs of withdrawal (i.e., paw tremors and head twitches), but had no effect in locomotor activity or conditioned place preference. GBP (50\u00a0mg/kg) also restored withdrawal-suppressed responding on a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule. However, GBP (50\u00a0mg/kg) had no effect in withdrawal-suppressed marble burying or tail suspension struggling and did not normalize the stress response induced by THC withdrawal, as indicated by plasma corticosterone. These data suggest gabapentin may be effective at treating cannabinoid withdrawal symptoms including somatic and affective symptoms but may act independently of endocrine stress activation."

                "abstract": "Attenuating emesis elicited by both disease and medical treatments of disease remains a critical public health challenge. Although cannabinergic medications have been used in certain treatment-resistant populations, Food and Drug Administration-approved cannabinoid antiemetics are associated with undesirable side effects, including cognitive disruption, that limit their prescription. Previous studies have shown that a metabolically stable analog of the endocannabinoid anandamide, methanandamide (mAEA), may produce lesser cognitive disruption than that associated with the primary psychoactive constituent in cannabis, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), raising the possibility that endocannabinoids may offer a therapeutic advantage over currently used medications. The present studies were conducted to evaluate this possibility by comparing the antiemetic effects of \u03949-THC (0.032-0.1 mg/kg) and mAEA (3.2-10.0 mg/kg) against nicotine- and lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced emesis and prodromal hypersalivation in squirrel monkeys. Pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg \u03949-THC blocked nicotine-induced emesis and reduced hypersalivation in all subjects and blocked LiCl-induced emesis and reduced hypersalivation in three of four subjects. Pretreatment with 10 mg/kg mAEA blocked nicotine-induced emesis in three of four subjects and LiCl-induced emesis in one of four subjects and reduced both nicotine- and LiCl-induced hypersalivation. Antiemetic effects of \u03949-THC and mAEA were reversed by rimonabant pretreatment, providing verification of cannabinoid receptor type 1 mediation. These studies systematically demonstrate for the first time the antiemetic effects of cannabinoid agonists in nonhuman primates. Importantly, although \u03949-THC produced superior antiemetic effects, the milder cognitive effects of mAEA demonstrated in previous studies suggest that it may provide a favorable treatment option under clinical circumstances in which antiemetic efficacy must be balanced against side effect liability. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Emesis has significant evolutionary value as a defense mechanism against ingested toxins; however, it is also one of the most common adverse symptoms associated with both disease and medical treatments of disease. The development of improved antiemetic pharmacotherapies has been impeded by a paucity of animal models. The present studies systematically demonstrate for the first time the antiemetic effects of the phytocannabinoid \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and endocannabinoid analog methanandamide in nonhuman primates."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that the non-euphorogenic phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) can ameliorate adverse effects of \u03949 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We determined whether CBD ameliorates cognitive deficits and withdrawal signs induced by cannabinoid CB1 /CB2 receptor agonists or produces these pharmacological effects on its own. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of THC or the CB1 /CB2 receptor full agonist WIN55212 alone, CBD alone or their combination were tested across a range of doses. Cognitive effects were assessed in C57BL/6 mice in a conditional discrimination task and in the Barnes maze. Cannabinoid withdrawal signs were assessed following precipitated withdrawal by acute administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635, the TRPV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine or the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261. KEY RESULTS: THC produced significant motor and cognitive impairment in the Barnes maze task, none of which were attenuated by the addition of CBD. CBD alone did not affect cognitive performance. Precipitation of withdrawal signs by SR141716 occurred in mice chronically treated with THC or WIN55,212. These withdrawal signs were not attenuated by addition of chronic CBD. Chronic treatment with CBD alone did not induce withdrawal signs precipitated by SR141716 or WAY100635. Chronic CBD treatment also produced anxiolysis, which was not altered by attempting to precipitate withdrawal-induced anxiety with a range of antagonists. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CBD as a monotherapy may prove to be a safer pharmacological agent, than CB1 receptor agonists alone or in combination with CBD, for the treatment of several disorders.

                "abstract": "Withdrawal from \u03949-tetrahyrocannibidol (THC) is associated with a host of dysphoric symptoms that increase probability of relapse. To date, many animal models of THC withdrawal rely on withdrawal-induced somatic withdrawal signs leaving withdrawal-suppressed behavior relatively unexplored. As compared with withdrawal-induced behaviors, ongoing behavior that is suppressed by withdrawal is a useful behavioral endpoint because it 1) more effectively models the subjective aspects of withdrawal and 2) identifies pharmacotherapies that restore behavior to baseline levels, rather than eliminate behavior induced by withdrawal. The current study assessed effects of spontaneous and rimonabant-precipitated THC withdrawal in mice responding on a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule of sucrose water reinforcement. Once behavior stabilized, male and female mice were administered THC (10\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle for five or six days. THC was either discontinued and behavior monitored for three days during abstinence, or the CB1 antagonist rimonabant (2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was used to precipitate withdrawal. Whereas spontaneous THC withdrawal had no effect on PR performance, THC-treated mice were differentially sensitive to rimonabant administration via large decreases in break point, overall response rate, and run rate relative to vehicle-treated mice. Importantly, pretreatment with the CB1 positive allosteric modulator ZCZ011 (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) did not prevent precipitated-withdrawal-induced behavioral impairment. These extend findings of earlier studies suggesting operant baselines are useful tools to study subjective effects of cannabinoid withdrawal. Additionally, operant baselines allow withdrawal pharmacotherapies to be tested in a restoration-of-function context, which may be more sensitive, selective, and clinically relevant."

                "abstract": "An improved understanding of the endocannabinoid system has provided new avenues of drug discovery and development toward the management of pain and other behavioral maladies. Exogenous cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor agonists such as \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol are increasingly used for their medicinal actions; however, their utility is constrained by concern regarding abuse-related subjective effects. This has led to growing interest in the clinical benefit of indirectly enhancing the activity of the highly labile endocannabinoids N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA (or anandamide)] and/or 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) via catabolic enzyme inhibition. The present studies were conducted to determine whether such actions can lead to CB1 agonist-like subjective effects, as reflected in CB1-related discriminative stimulus effects in laboratory subjects. Squirrel monkeys (n = 8) that discriminated the CB1 full agonist AM4054 (0.01 mg/kg) from vehicle were used to study, first, the inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) or monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) alone or in combination [FAAH (URB597, AM4303); MGL (AM4301); FAAH/MGL (JZL195, AM4302)] and, second, the ability of the endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG to produce CB1 agonist-like effects when administered alone or after enzyme inhibition. Results indicate that CB1-related discriminative stimulus effects were produced by combined, but not selective, inhibition of FAAH and MGL, and that these effects were nonsurmountably antagonized by low doses of rimonabant. Additionally, FAAH or MGL inhibition revealed CB1-like subjective effects produced by AEA but not by 2-AG. Taken together, the present data suggest that therapeutic effects of combined, but not selective, enhancement of AEA or 2-AG activity via enzyme inhibition may be accompanied by CB1 receptor-mediated subjective effects."

Here, the behavioral effects of JWH-018 and JWH-073 were examined in one behavioral assay selective for cannabinoid agonism, rhesus monkeys (n = 4) discriminating \u0394\u2079-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394\u2079-THC; 0.1 mg/kg i.v.), and another assay sensitive to cannabinoid withdrawal, i.e., monkeys (n = 3) discriminating the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg i.v.) during chronic \u0394\u2079-THC (1 mg/kg s.c. 12 h) treatment. \u0394\u2079-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073 increased drug-lever responding in monkeys discriminating \u0394\u2079-THC; the ED\u2085\u2080 values were 0.044, 0.013, and 0.058 mg/kg, respectively and the duration of action was 4, 2, and 1 h, respectively. Rimonabant (0.32-3.2 mg/kg) produced surmountable antagonism of \u0394\u2079-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073. Schild analyses and single-dose apparent affinity estimates yielded apparent pA\u2082/pK(B) values of 6.65, 6.68, and 6.79 in the presence of \u0394\u2079-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073, respectively. In \u0394\u2079-THC-treated monkeys discriminating rimonabant, the training drug increased responding on the rimonabant lever; the ED\u2085\u2080 value of rimonabant was 0.20 mg/kg. \u0394\u2079-THC (1-10 mg/kg), JWH-018 (0.32-3.2 mg/kg), and JWH-073 (3.2-32 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the rimonabant-discriminative stimulus (i.e., withdrawal). These results suggest that \u0394\u2079-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073 act through the same receptors to produce \u0394\u2079-THC-like subjective effects and attenuate \u0394\u2079-THC withdrawal. The relatively short duration of action of JWH-018 and JWH-073 might lead to more frequent use, which could strengthen habitual use by increasing the frequency of stimulus-outcome pairings. This coupled with the possible greater efficacy of JWH-018 at cannabinoid 1 receptors could be associated with greater dependence liability than \u0394\u2079-THC."

                "abstract": "The synthetic forms of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), dronabinol or nabilone, have been approved to treat several indications. However, due to safety concerns their clinical utility remains limited. Consequently, there is a need for developing cannabinoid (CB) ligands that display better behavioral pharmacological profiles than \u03949-THC. Here, we utilized drug discrimination methods to compare the interoceptive effects of CB ligands that vary in potency, efficacy, and selectivity at the CB receptors, including two ligands, AM411 and AM4089, that show CB1 partial agonist-like actions in vitro. Male rats were trained to discriminate 0.1\u00a0mg/kg AM2201 from saline under a fixed-ratio (FR) 10 response schedule of food reinforcement. After establishing AM2201's discriminative-stimulus effects, pretreatment tests with the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant blocked AM2201's effects, whereas the peripherally-restricted antagonist AM6545 had no effect. Next, the generalization profiles of AM411 and AM4089 with CB1 full agonists (JWH-018, CP-55,940, AM8936), partial agonist (\u03949-THC), and non-cannabinoids (fentanyl, atropine) were compared. The CBs either fully (AM2201, CP-55,940, JWH-018, AM8936, \u03949-THC) or partially (AM411, AM4089) substituted for AM2201, whereas fentanyl and atropine did not produce AM2201-like effects. All CB drugs were more potent than \u03949-THC and correlation analysis confirmed that the relative behavioral potencies of CBs corresponded strongly with their relative affinities at the CB1 but not CB2 receptors. Together, our results further demonstrate that AM411 and AM4089 exhibit better pharmacological profiles compared to \u03949-THC, in that they are more potent and display in vivo partial agonist-like actions that are centrally mediated via CB1 receptors."

                "abstract": "RATIONALE: Cannabinoid CB1 inverse agonists hold therapeutic promise as appetite suppressants but have produced suicidal behaviors among a small subpopulation in clinical trials. Anatomical and pharmacological evidence implicate the 5HT1A serotonin receptor in suicide in humans and impulsivity in humans and animals. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess whether 5HT1A blockade is necessary for CB1 ligands to produce impulsivity. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were administered the CB1 inverse agonist AM 251, the CB1 antagonist AM 6527, or the peripherally restricted antagonist AM 6545, with or without pretreatment with the 5HT1A antagonist WAY 100,635 (WAY) on the paced fixed consecutive number (FCN) task, which measures choice to terminate a chain of responses prematurely. As FCN is sensitive to changes in time perception, which have been demonstrated with CB1 blockade, a novel variable consecutive number task with discriminative stimulus (VCN-S D ) was also performed and proposed to be less sensitive to changes in timing. RESULTS: Pretreatment with WAY enabled mild but significant reductions in FCN accuracy for AM 251 and AM 6527. No effects were found for AM 6545. On the VCN-S D task, substantial impairments were found for the combination of WAY and AM 251. CONCLUSIONS: AM 251, but not the antagonists AM 6527 or AM 6545, produced impulsivity only following systemic 5HT1A blockade. Although preliminary, the results may indicate that disrupted serotonin signaling produces a vulnerability to undesirable effects of CB1 inverse agonists, which is not evident in the general population. Furthermore, neutral CB1 antagonists do not produce this effect and therefore may have greater safety."

                "abstract": "Nicotine, the main psychoactive component of tobacco, and (-)-\u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, play major roles in tobacco and marijuana dependence as reinforcers of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. Drugs that act as inverse agonists of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the brain can attenuate the rewarding and abuse-related effects of nicotine and THC, but their clinical use is hindered by potentially serious side effects. The recently developed CB1-receptor neutral antagonists may provide an alternative therapeutic approach to nicotine and cannabinoid dependence. Here we compare attenuation of nicotine and THC reinforcement and reinstatement in squirrel monkeys by the CB1-receptor inverse agonist rimonabant and by the recently developed CB1-receptor neutral antagonist AM4113. Both rimonabant and AM4113 reduced two effects of nicotine and THC that play major roles in tobacco and marijuana dependence: (1) maintenance of high rates of drug-taking behavior, and (2) priming- or cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in abstinent subjects (models of relapse). In contrast, neither rimonabant nor AM4113 modified cocaine-reinforced or food-reinforced operant behavior under similar experimental conditions. However, both rimonabant and AM4113 reduced cue-induced reinstatement in monkeys trained to self-administer cocaine, suggesting the involvement of a common cannabinoid-mediated mechanism in the cue-induced reinstatement for different drugs of abuse. These findings point to CB1-receptor neutral antagonists as a new class of medications for treatment of both tobacco dependence and cannabis dependence."

                "abstract": "Marijuana-dependent individuals report using marijuana to alleviate withdrawal, suggesting that pharmacotherapy of marijuana withdrawal could promote abstinence. To identify potential pharmacotherapies for marijuana withdrawal, this study first characterized rimonabant-induced Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) withdrawal in rhesus monkeys by using drug discrimination and directly observable signs. Second, drugs were examined for their capacity to modify cannabinoid withdrawal. Monkeys receiving chronic Delta(9)-THC (1 mg/kg/12 h s.c.) discriminated the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg i.v.) under a fixed ratio schedule of stimulus-shock termination. The discriminative stimulus effects of rimonabant were dose-dependent (ED(50) = 0.25 mg/kg) and accompanied by head shaking. In the absence of chronic Delta(9)-THC treatment (i.e., in nondependent monkeys), a larger dose (3.2 mg/kg) of rimonabant produced head shaking and tachycardia. Temporary discontinuation of Delta(9)-THC treatment resulted in increased responding on the rimonabant lever, head shaking, and activity during the dark cycle. The rimonabant discriminative stimulus was attenuated fully by Delta(9)-THC (at doses larger than mg/kg/12 h) and the cannabinoid agonist CP 55940 [5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]phenol], and partially by the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 [(R)-(+)-[2, 3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone mesylate] and the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist clonidine. In contrast, a benzodiazepine (diazepam) and monoamine agonist (cocaine) did not attenuate the rimonabant discriminative stimulus. Head shaking was attenuated by all test compounds. These results show that the discriminative stimulus effects of rimonabant in Delta(9)-THC-treated monkeys are a more pharmacologically selective measure of cannabinoid withdrawal than rimonabant-induced head shaking. These results suggest that cannabinoid and noncannabinoid (alpha(2)-adrenergic) agonists are potentially useful therapeutics for marijuana dependence inasmuch as they attenuate the subjective experience of Delta(9)-THC withdrawal."

                "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has been one of the major targets in medication development for treating substance use disorders (SUDs). Early studies indicated that rimonabant, a selective CB1R antagonist with an inverse agonist profile, was highly promising as a therapeutic for SUDs. However, its adverse side effects, such as depression and suicidality, led to its withdrawal from clinical trials worldwide in 2008. Consequently, much research interest shifted to developing neutral CB1R antagonists based on the recognition that rimonabant's side effects may be related to its inverse agonist profile. In this article, we first review rimonabant's research background as a potential pharmacotherapy for SUDs. Then, we discuss the possible mechanisms underlying its therapeutic anti-addictive effects versus its adverse effects. Lastly, we discuss the rationale for developing neutral CB1R antagonists as potential treatments for SUDs, the supporting evidence in recent research, and the challenges of this strategy. We conclude that developing neutral CB1R antagonists without inverse agonist profile may represent attractive strategies for the treatment of SUDs."

                "abstract": "Cannabinoid subtype 1 receptor (CB1R) antagonists were originally developed as anti-obesity agents. Unfortunately, SR1417116A (rimonabant), the first marketed inverse agonist of CB1R, produced CNS-related adverse effects including depression and suicidal ideation, and thus it was withdrawn from the market. These effects of rimonabant became evident in patients following chronic dosing. Standard preclinical toxicity studies failed to detect these adverse effects. The goal of these studies was to perform an integrated battery of behavioral assays to better understand the behavioral effects of rimonabant following both acute and chronic administration. In the present study, acute dosing with rimonabant in rats significantly decreased food consumption; decreased measures of locomotor activity; increased scratching, grooming and wet-dog shakes; and increased defecation. Subsequently, animals were tested using a chronic dosing regimen but prior to drug administration for that day. The highest dose of rimonabant tested significantly decreased marble burying behavior, presumably anxiolysis. There were also significant effects in social interaction after chronic dosing. Our results did not reveal significant rimonabant-induced anxiogenic behaviors. Future studies to characterize behavioral screens for anxiogenic effects of CB1 antagonists in rodents should further explore social interaction paradigms and potential comorbid factors of rimonabant dosing such as sex, age, and obesity."

The endocannabinoid system has been linked to homeostatic processes, including metabolism, food intake, and the regulation of body weight. Rimonabant, an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, was effective at producing weight loss in obese subjects. However, due to adverse psychiatric side effects, rimonabant was removed from the market. More recently, we reported an inverse relationship between cannabis use and BMI, which has now been duplicated by several groups. As those results may appear contradictory, we review here preclinical and clinical studies that have studied the impact on body weight of various cannabinoid CB1 drugs. Notably, we will review the impact of CB1 inverse agonists, agonists, partial agonists, and neutral antagonists. Those findings clearly point out the cannabinoid CB1 as a potential effective target for the treatment of obesity. Recent preclinical studies suggest that ligands targeting the CB1 may retain the therapeutic potential of rimonabant without the negative side effect profile. Such approaches should be tested in clinical trials for validation."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol, a therapeutic with potential serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity, is the second most prevalent cannabinoid in Cannabis after \u0394(9)-THC. The extent to which cannabidiol modifies the effects of \u0394(9)-THC has not been firmly established, especially with respect to abuse-related effects in rhesus monkeys where previously antagonistic interactions have been reported for some behavioral outcomes. METHODS: Cannabidiol and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (\u00b1)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) were tested in two separate discrimination assays in rhesus monkeys. One group (n=6) discriminated \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394(9)-THC; 0.1mg/kg i.v.); a second group (n=6) discriminated the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (1mg/kg i.v.) while receiving \u0394(9)-THC daily (1mg/kg/12hs.c.). Responding was maintained under a fixed ratio 5 schedule of stimulus-shock termination. RESULTS: Both training drugs dose-dependently increased the percentage of responses on the respective drug-associated levers. Cannabidiol (up to 17.8mg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT (up to 0.178mg/kg) did not substitute for either training drug; however, both significantly increased the potency of \u0394(9)-THC to produce discriminative stimulus effects. Moreover, 8-OH-DPAT significantly attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of rimonabant, whereas cannabidiol did not modify the rimonabant discriminative stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: These results, which are consistent with cannabidiol lacking CB1 receptor agonist or antagonist activity in vivo, demonstrate enhancement of the effects of \u0394(9)-THC by cannabidiol, albeit at cannabidiol amounts larger than those in Cannabis or cannabidiol-based therapeutics (nabiximols). In addition to showing that cannabidiol and a 5-HT1A receptor agonist have overlapping behavioral effects, the current results suggest that 5-HT1A agonism enhances the CB1 receptor-mediated effects of \u0394(9)-THC."

            "abstract": "Diabetes-associated liver injury becomes a dominant hepatopathy, leading to hepatic failure worldwide. The current study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of ginsenoside Rh1 (G-Rh1) on liver injury induced by T2DM. A T2DM model was established using C57BL/6 mice through feeding with HFD followed by injection with streptozotocin at 100 mg\u00b7kg-1.. Then the mice were continuously administered with G-Rh1 (5 and 10 mg\u00b7kg-1), to explore the protective effects of G-Rh1 against liver injury. Results showed that G-Rh1 exerted significant effects on maintaining the levels of FBG and insulin, and ameliorated the increased levels of TG, TC and LDL-C induced by T2DM. Moreover, apoptosis in liver tissue was relieved by G-Rh1, according to histological analysis. Particularly, in diabetic mice, it was observed that not only the increased secretion of G6Pase and PEPCK in the gluconeogenesis pathway, but also inflammatory factors including NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 were suppressed by G-Rh1 treatment. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms by which G-Rh1 exhibited ameliorative effects was associated with its capacity to inhibit the activation of the Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway induced by T2DM. Taken together, our preliminary study demonstrated the potential mechnism of G-Rh1 in protecting the liver against T2DM-induced damage."

                "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rk3 (G-Rk3) is a main active ingredient of ginsenosides. Several recent studies demonstrated that ginsenosides have potential anti-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) properties. To evaluate the anti-T2DM effect of G-Rk3 and verify its potential mechanism, a high-fat-diet/streptozocin (HFD/STZ) induced model of T2DM in C57BL/6 mice and a high glucose induced insulin resistance model of HepG2 cells were applied in this research. Our analysis indicated that G-Rk3 reduced HFD/STZ induced hyperglycemia, and serum insulin and inflammation levels, and ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, and prevented liver histological changes. Furthermore, it also significantly reduced lipid accumulation as shown by lower TG, LDL-C and TC serum concentrations and Oil Red O staining in liver tissues. The hypoglycemic effect of G-Rk3 seemed to be partially mediated via the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which was supported by the activated p-Akt, p-FoxO1 and GLUT2 and inhibited FoxO1, PEPCK and G6pase protein expressions in the liver as well as increased glucose uptake in high glucose induced HepG2 cells. The gene expressions of hepatic gluconeogenesis were also down-regulated by G-Rk3 in HFD/STZ induced T2DM mice. In addition, G-Rk3 suppressed HFD/STZ induced lipid accumulation by regulating related gene and protein expressions such as p-ACC, FAS and SREBP-1, which are the downstream targets of AMPK. AMPK and Akt inhibitors significantly reversed G-Rk3 mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid accumulation. Thus, our study is the first to illustrate that G-Rk3 mediates hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid accumulation via activating the AMPK/Akt signaling pathway in HFD/STZ induced T2DM mice."

                "abstract": "Although ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) has received extensive attention in the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the past few decades, there are few studies on the complications of T2DM. At present, obesity-linked diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most prevailing element of the end-stage renal failure in the world. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ameliorative effects of ginsenoside Rh1 (G-Rh1) on DN induced by high fat diet plus streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) through some potential and combined mechanisms of action. The results showed that G-Rh1 treatment at 5 and 10 mg/kg for 8 weeks exerted excellent effects in controlling fasting blood glucose (FBG), improving glucose tolerance, and increasing insulin level. In addition, G-Rh1 effectively prevents the excessive production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a diabetic nephropathy marker, in HFD/STZ induced DN mice. Meanwhile, oxidation indicators including SOD, GSH, and MDA were improved by G-Rh1 treatment to varying degrees. It is worth noting that G-Rh1 not only inhibits the secretion of Nox1 and Nox4 in kidney tissues, but also has an inhibitory effect on inflammatory factors and NF-[Formula: see text]B signaling pathway. Importantly, further in-depth research on molecular mechanisms provides vital evidence that the ameliorative effect of G-Rh1 on DN is related to the inhibition of apoptosis and the AMPK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In summary, G-Rh1 may be of great value in improving the treatment of DN although more experimental data is needed."

                "abstract": "Diabetic liver injury (DLI) is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus, which seriously jeopardizes human health. Punicalagin (PU), a polyphenolic compound mainly found in pomegranate peel, has been shown to ameliorate metabolic diseases such as DLI, and the mechanism needs to be further explored. In this study, a HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mouse model is established to investigate the effect and mechanism of PU on DLI. The results show that PU intervention significantly improves liver histology and serum biochemical abnormalities in diabetic mice, significantly inhibits the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins such as NLRP3, Caspase1, IL-1\u03b2, and GSDMD in the liver of diabetic mice, and up-regulated the expression of autophagy-related proteins. Meanwhile, PU treatment significantly increases FoxO1 protein expression and inhibits TXNIP protein expression in the liver of diabetic mice. The above results are further verified in the HepG2 cell injury model induced by high glucose. AS1842856 is a FoxO1 specific inhibitor. The intervention of AS1842856 combined with PU reverses the regulatory effects of PU on pyroptosis and autophagy in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PU may inhibit pyroptosis and upregulate autophagy by regulating FoxO1/TXNIP signaling, thereby alleviating DLI."

                "abstract": "Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major challenge in liver surgery. Diet restriction reduces liver damage by increasing stress resistance; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the preventive effect of 12-h fasting on mouse liver IRI. Partial warm hepatic IRI model in wild-type male C57BL/6 mice was used. The control ischemia and reperfusion (IR) group of mice was given food and water ad libitum, while the fasting IR group was given water but not food for 12 h before ischemic insult. In 12-h fasting mice, serum liver-derived enzyme level and tissue damages due to IR were strongly suppressed. Serum \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was significantly raised before ischemia and during reperfusion. Up-regulated BHB induced an increment in the expression of FOXO1 transcription factor by raising the level of acetylated histone. Antioxidative enzyme heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a target gene of FOXO1, then increased. Autophagy activity was also enhanced. Serum high-mobility group box 1 was remarkably lowered by the 12-h fasting, and activation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production and liver injury were reduced. Exogenous BHB administration or histone deacetylase inhibitor administration into the control fed mice ameliorated liver IRI, while FOXO1 inhibitor administration to the 12-h fasting group exacerbated liver IRI. The 12-h fasting exerted beneficial effects on the prevention of liver IRI by increasing BHB, thus up-regulating FOXO1 and HO-1, and by reducing the inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death via the down-regulation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome."

Our research investigated the treatment of AU on liver fibrosis and potential mechanisms on high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and high glucose (HG)&TGF-\u03b21-induced LX-2\u00a0cells. Results showed that AU restored hepatic function without affecting blood sugar levels in diabetic mice. Meanwhile, the enhanced levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-c were reversed in hepatic tissue after AU treatment. Histomorphology assays including H&E, Masson, PAS, Oil red and Sirius red staining showed that AU treatment reduced liver swelling, steatosis and fibrosis. Mechanistic studies showed that AU alleviated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory responses via inhibiting ER stress-mediated IRE1\u03b1/TXNIP signaling pathway, which could postpone the development of T2DM induced hepatic fibrosis. In addition, the ROS generation and the up-regulated expression of NADHP oxidase 4 (NOX4) in the liver tissue were suppressed by AU treatment. Moreover, in vitro model, NOX4 activation was prominently enhanced and AU treatment blocked HG&TGF-\u03b21-induced NOX4 derived superoxide generation and thereby ameliorating hepatic stellate cell activation, which can be abrogated in the overexpression of NOX4 LX-2\u00a0cells. In addition, inhibition effects on ER stress-mediated IRE1\u03b1/TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome by AU treatment also were abolished in the overexpression of NOX4 LX-2\u00a0cells. Meanwhile, molecular docking results indicated that AU and NOX4 protein have a higher affinity. Taken together, AU might be a potential nutraceutical or therapeutic drug to ameliorate hepatic impairment and fibrosis in T2DM."

                "title": "Physalin B ameliorates inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury mice by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 via the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.",
                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Physalin B (PB) is an active constituent of Physalis alkekengi L. var. Franchetii, which is a traditional medicine for clearing heat and detoxification, resolving phlegm, and diuresis. It has been commonly applied to treat sore throat, phlegm-heat, cough, dysuria, pemphigus, and eczema. AIM OF STUDY: Physalin B has shown efficacy as an anti-acute lung injury (ALI) agent previously; however, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. In the present study, we established a lipopolysaccharide-induced septic ALI model using BALB/c mice to further confirm the therapeutic potential of PB and to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 75% ethanol and macroporous resin for extraction, separation, and enrichment of PB. The LPS-induced ALI mouse model was used to determine anti-inflammatory effects of PB. The severity of acute lung injury was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, wet/dry lung ratio, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissue. An automatic analyzer was used to measure the arterial blood gas index. Protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissue was measured using an ELISA. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure changes in RNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. A fluorometric assay kit was used for determination of apoptosis-related factors to assess anti-apoptotic effects of PB. Western blotting was used to assess levels of key pathway proteins and apoptosis-related proteins. Connections between the pathways were tested through inhibitor experiments. RESULTS: Pretreatment with PB (15\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1 d-1, i.g.) significantly reduced lung wet/dry weight ratios and MPO activity in blood and BALF of ALI mice, and it alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue. The levels of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 and their mRNA levels in blood, BALF, and lung tissue were reduced following PB pretreatment. PB pretreatment also downregulated the apoptotic factors caspase-3, caspase-9, and apoptotic protein Bax, and it upregulated apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 pathways were inhibited through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway due to PB pretreatment, whereas administration of PI3K inhibitors increased activation of these pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that the anti-ALI properties of PB are closely associated with the inactivation of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 by altering the PI3K/Akt pathway. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel strategy for application of PB as a potential agent for treating patients with ALI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action of PB against ALI."

                "abstract": "Ginsenosides have been reported to have various biological effects, such as immune regulation and anticancer activity. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory role of a combination of Rg2 and Rh1, which are minor ginsenosides, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation. In vitro experiments were performed using the RAW264.7 cell line, and an in vivo model of inflammation was established using LPS-treated ICR mice. We employed Griess assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and hematoxylin and eosin staining to evaluate the effect of Rg2 and Rh1. We found that Rg2 and Rh1 significantly decreased LPS-induced major inflammatory mediator production, inducible-nitric oxide synthase expression, and nitric oxide production in macrophages. Moreover, Rg2 and Rh1 combination treatment inhibited the binding of LPS to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, the combination of ginsenoside Rg2 and Rh1 suppressed inflammation by abolishing the binding of LPS to TLR4, thereby inhibiting the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. The combined ginsenoside synergistically blocked LPS-mediated PKC\u03b4 translocation to the plasma membrane, resulting in p38-STAT1 activation and NF-\u03baB translocation. In addition, mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b2, were significantly decreased by combined ginsenoside treatment. Notably, the 20 mg/kg ginsenoside treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced acute tissue inflammation levels in vivo, as indicated by the tissue histological damage scores and the levels of biochemical markers for liver and kidney function from mouse serum. These results suggest that the minor ginsenosides Rg2 and Rh1 may play a key role in prevention of LPS-induced acute inflammation and tissue damage."

                "abstract": "GdCl3 (gadolinium chloride) has been shown to reduce blood glucose; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Liver gluconeogenesis is an important pathway involved in the maintenance of glucose homoeostasis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of GdCl3 in hepatic gluconeogenesis and explore the precise molecular mechanism. Animals from a classical Type\u00a02 diabetic mouse model, created by exposing C57BL/6J mice to a high-fat diet for 4 months, were treated with GdCl3 or saline. Body weight, blood glucose and insulin sensitivity were monitored. It was observed that GdCl3 significantly reduced blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity. A pyruvate tolerance test showed further that GdCl3 suppressed gluconeogenesis in diabetic mice. In the livers of GdCl3-treated mice, the expression of Pepck (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and G6pase (glucose-6-phosphatase), the key enzymes in gluconeogenesis, were dramatically reduced. Furthermore, experiments in hepatocarcinoma cells revealed that GdCl3 activated the Akt pathway to promote the phosphorylation of FoxO1 (forkhead box O1), leading to the suppression of gluconeogenesis by reducing the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase and resulting in decreased cellular production of glucose. Comparable results were observed in the livers of GdCl3-treated mice. In addition, we have shown that GdCl3 augmented the role of insulin to control hepatic glucose production. We conclude that GdCl3 reduces hyperglycaemia via the Akt/FoxO1-induced suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis, both in Type\u00a02 diabetic mice (in\u00a0vivo) and in hepatocarcinoma cells (in\u00a0vitro), suggesting that GdCl3 may be a potential therapeutic agent for diabetes.

                "abstract": "Though the antidiabetic effect of ginsenoside compound K (CK) has been well studied, the effect of CK on diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear. Whether CK would have a protective effect against DN and it could exert the protective effect by inhibiting the oxidative stress, NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-\u03baB/p38 signaling pathway were investigated in this study. Here, the HFD (high fat diet)/STZ (streptozotocin)-induced DN mice model was established to assess the CK effect in vivo. Parallel experiments uncovering the molecular mechanism by which CK prevents from DN was performed in rat glomerular mesangial cell line HBZY-1 exposed to high glucose. CK (10, 20, 40\u202fmg/kg/day) were intragastrically administered for 8\u202fweeks, the general status, biochemical parameters, renal pathological changes and oxidative stress-parameters were observed, and the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-\u03baB/p38 signaling pathway were evaluated. The results showed that the elevated fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and 24-hour urine protein of the DN mice were significantly decreased, and the proliferation of glomerular mesangial matrix was alleviated by CK. In addition, the generation of ROS in the kidney was significantly decreased, and the expression of Nox1 and Nox4 proteins were down-regulated. Further, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1) and the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were also significantly down-regulated in vivo and in vitro. The phosphorylation of renal p38 MAPK was also inhibited by CK. MCC950 (an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome) and VX-765 (a Caspase-1 Inhibitor) showed significant interaction with CK on the decrease of IL-1\u03b2 concentration in HBZY-1 cells. In conclusion, our study provided evidence that the protective effect of CK on diabetes-induced renal injury is associated with down-regulating the expression of NADHP oxidase, and inhibition of ROS-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-\u03baB/p38 signaling pathway, suggesting its therapeutic implication for renal inflammation."

                "abstract": "This work aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effects and underlying mechanism of whole grain proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.; WPM) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The results showed that WPM supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum lipid levels in T2DM mice induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ), with improved glucose tolerance, liver and kidney injury, and insulin resistance. In addition, WPM significantly inhibited the expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes G6pase, Pepck, Foxo1, and Pgc-1\u03b1. Further study by miRNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that WPM supplementation mainly altered the liver miRNA expression profile of T2DM mice by increasing the expression of miR-144-3p_R-1 and miR-423-5p, reducing the expression of miR-22-5p_R-1 and miR-30a-3p. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the target genes of these miRNAs were mainly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. WPM supplementation significantly increased the level of PI3K, p-AKT, and GSK3\u03b2 in the liver of T2DM mice. Taken together, WPM exerts antidiabetic effects by improving the miRNA profile and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit gluconeogenesis. This study implies that PM can act as a dietary supplement to attenuate T2DM."

                "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and serious complication of diabetes and causes kidney failure. Ginsenoside Rg5 (Rg5) is an important monomer in the main protopanaxadiol component of black ginseng. Rg5 has exhibited some beneficial biological effects, such as anti-cancer, neuroprotection, and anti-depression, but the effect of Rg5 on DN and its potential mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Rg5 on kidney injury of C57BL/6 diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin. After treatment with different concentration of Rg5 (30 and 60 mg kg-1\u00b7d-1) for 6 consecutive weeks, the fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, serum creatinine, serum urea, and serum UA in Rg5-treated DN mice were significantly reduced, while the renal histopathology was remarkably improved, compared with untreated DN mice. Moreover, ROS production, oxidative stress markers (MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX), Nox4 and TXNIP expressions of kidney in DN mice were significantly reduced after Rg5 treatment. Additionally, the expression levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1) and the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were significantly inhibited, and the expression of NF-kB and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK were also decreased with Rg5 treatment compared with no treatment in DN mice. Together, our results indicate that Rg5 attenuated renal injury in diabetic mice by inhibiting oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation to reduce inflammatory responses, indicating that Rg5 is a potential compound to prevent or control diabetic renal injury."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) largely promotes the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the inhibition of HGP significantly ameliorates T2DM. Huanglian-Renshen-Decoction (HRD), a classic traditional Chinese herb medicine, is widely used for the treatment of diabetes in clinic for centuries and proved effective. However, the relevant mechanisms of HRD are not fully understood. PURPOSE: Based on that, this study was designed to identify the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of HRD on HGP by a comprehensive investigation that integrated in vivo functional experiments, network pharmacology, molecular docking, transcriptomics and molecular biology. METHODS: After confirming the therapeutic effects of HRD on T2DM mice, the inhibitory role of HRD on HGP was evaluated by pyruvate and glucagon tolerance tests, liver positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the detection of gluconeogenic key enzymes. Then, network pharmacology and transcriptomics approaches were used to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Molecular biology, computational docking analysis and in vitro experiments were applied for final mechanism verification. RESULTS: Here, our results showed that HRD can decrease weight gain and blood glucose, increase fasting insulin, glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity in T2DM mice. Dysregulated lipid profile was also corrected by HRD administration. Pyruvate, glucagon tolerance tests and liver PET imaging all indicated that HRD inhibited the abnormal HGP of T2DM, and the expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were significantly suppressed by HRD as expected. Network pharmacology and transcriptomics approaches illustrated that PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of HRD on HGP. Afterward, further western blot and immunoprecipitation found that HRD did activate PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway in T2DM mice, which confirmed previous results. Additionally, the conclusion was further supported by molecular docking and in vitro experiments, in which identified HRD compound, oxyberberine, was proven to exert an obvious effect on Akt. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that HRD can treat T2DM by inhibiting hepatic glucose production, the underlying mechanisms were associated with the activation of PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway."

                "abstract": "Polysaccharide extracted from okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench), a traditional functional food, is a biologically active substance reported to possess hypoglycemic and anti-oxidative qualities. However, it is unknown which polysaccharides play a role and have the potential mechanism. This present study is to assess the possible impacts of a novel polysaccharide isolated from okra (OP) on mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 100 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) twice, to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We found that an eight-week administration of OP at 200 or 400 mg/kg body weight significantly alleviated the symptoms, with elevations in blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as reducing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body weight, food, and water consumption. The OP treatment increased the hepatic glycogen and decreased the mussy hepatic cords and liver fibrosis in the T2DM mice. The decreases of ROS and MDA and the increases of SOD, GSH-Px and CAT in liver were observed after administration of OP. OP alleviated the T2DM characteristics through the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) pathway, and enhanced the nuclear factor erythroid-2 (Nrf2) expression and promoted Nrf2-medicated heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression. OP also relieved mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting NOX2 activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that a polysaccharide isolated from okra exerts anti-T2DM effects partly by modulating oxidative stress through PI3K/AKT/GSK3\u03b2 pathway-medicated Nrf2 transport. We have determined that a polysaccharide possesses hypoglycemic activity, as well as its underlying mechanism."

It has been used in the treatment of many types of diseases with signs of deficiency of Yin in the kidneys in China clinically. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of Liuwei dihuang decoction on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in liver of T2DM rats with insulin resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2DM model was induced in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by high sugar and high fat diets combined with small dose of streptozocin (STZ) injection. The successful T2DM rats were randomly allocated three group--vehicle group, positive control group and Liuwei Dihuang decoction group. After 12-weeks treatment with distilled water, rosiglitazone and LWDHT by intragastric administration respectively, the rats were put to death in batches. The variance of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin (FINS) in serum were determined, the pathological changes of each rats' liver were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the expression of insulin receptor substrate 2(IRS2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinas B (Akt) involving the canonical PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were detected by Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-PCR), and the expression level of IRS2, PI3K, Akt protein and phosphorylated IRS2, PI3K, Akt protein were evaluated by Western Blot. All the data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: Four weeks of treatment with LWDHT could significantly decrease the level of FBG and FINS in serum, improve the cellular morphology of liver, kidney, pancreas tissue, and the expression of IRS2, PI3K, Akt mRNA and phosphorylated IRS2, PI3K, Akt protein involved in the canonical PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of T2DM rats in liver were significantly up-regulated, while the total IRS2, PI3K, and Akt protein had no obvious changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Liuwei Dihuang decoction could intervene insulin resistance of T2DM, in part, through regulation of canonical PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of T2DM rats in liver."

It has been reported that Ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1) has strong hepatoprotective effects for acute liver injury, but its protective mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. This study aims to explore the detailed molecular mechanisms of G-Rg1 on acute liver injury via autophagy. Methods: The role of G-Rg1 by autophagic induction was studied in the mouse model of acute liver injury which induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Liver function, inflammatory reaction and apoptosis were detected when autophagy has been inhibited by 3-MA or stimulated by RPA. MCC950 and ATP were applied to investigate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in acute liver injury. The differential expression of NF-\u03baB, NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase 1, caspase 3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, LC3-I, LC3-II, Beclin-1, PINK1 and Parkin have been detected by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Results: G-Rg1 could decrease ALT, AST, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in mice with CCl4-induced acute liver injury. The change of autophagy and apoptosis after the treatment of 3-MA or RPA demonstrated that the autophagy played a key role in the protective effect of G-Rg1 in acute liver injury. The enhancement of G-Rg1 promoted-autophagy resulted in the significant decrease in NF-\u03baB, NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase 1, caspase 3, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which suggesting that NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway was associated with the autophagy induced by G-Rg1 in acute liver injury. Conclusion: G-Rg1 ameliorated acute liver injury via the autophagy, which may be related to NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway."

                "abstract": "Obesity-related renal disease is related to caloric excess promoting deleterious cellular responses. However, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in progressive kidney disease, as well as a therapeutic strategy, is still absent. Fisetin (FIS), as a natural flavonoid, possesses various bioactivities in a number of disease models. However, its role in obesity-associated kidney injury is still unclear and requires elucidation. In our study, an obesity animal model was established using C57BL/6 mice fed with a normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks with or without FIS administration (20, 40 or 80 mg kg-1). Our results indicated that chronic HFD feeding led to a significant body weight gain in mice compared to the normal control group, accompanied by a marked insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, whereas FIS treatment exerted prominently protective effects. In addition, FIS significantly attenuated HFD-induced histological alterations in renal tissue samples. Moreover, FIS treatment down-regulated expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and up-regulated nephrin and podocin expression levels in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice, improving their renal dysfunction. After HFD feeding, mice treated with FIS exhibited a decrease in phosphorylated IRS1Ser307, and an increase in phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 1 (IRS1Tyr608), AKT, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2. Furthermore, FIS administration markedly restrained the inflammatory response in the kidneys of HFD-challenged mice, as evidenced by the reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which was attributed to the blockage of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling. Importantly, FIS-treated obese mice exerted a remarkable decrease in RIP3 expressions in the kidneys compared to obese mice in the absence of FIS, along with an evident reduction in the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a Caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and Caspase-1. The protective effects of FIS against HFD-induced renal injury were verified in vitro using palmitate (PAL)-treated HK2 cells, an immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line from the adult human kidney. In summary, our results supported the notion that FIS functions as a promising agent to improve insulin resistance and inflammatory response against metabolic stress-induced renal injury."

The results revealed that carvacrol improved blood glucose and insulin resistance of T2DM db/db mice. After treatment with carvacrol for 6\u00a0weeks, the serum levels of TC, TG and LDL\u2011C were markedly reduced, whereas HDL\u2011C levels were significantly increased in db/db mice. Furthermore, carvacrol administration significantly decreased serum ALT and AST levels in db/db mice. Serum BUN, Cre and UA levels were markedly higher in db/db mice compared with those in the control group; however, carvacrol treatment markedly reduced their serum levels in db/db mice. Furthermore, histological examinations confirmed that carvacrol could protect the liver of db/db mice. Carvacrol could ameliorate liver injury induced by T2DM via mediating insulin, TLR4/NF\u2011\u03baB and AKT1/mTOR signaling pathways. The present findings suggested that carvacrol exerted protective effects on the liver in T2DM db/db mice, which could be related to insulin, TLR4/NF\u2011\u03baB and AKT1/mTOR signaling pathways."

                "abstract": "The present study investigated the chronic efficacy of oleanolic acid (OA), a triterpenoid selected from our recent screening, on hyperglycemia in type-2 diabetic mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet followed by low doses of streptozotocin to generate a type-2 diabetic model. OA (100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 2 weeks with its effects monitored for 6 weeks. High-fat feeding and streptozotocin generated a steady hyperglycemia (21.2 \u00b1 1.1 mM) but OA administration reversed the hyperglycemia by ~60%. Interestingly, after the cessation of OA administration, the reversed hyperglycemia was sustained for the entire post-treatment period of the study (4 weeks) despite the reoccurrence of dyslipidemia. Examination of insulin secretion and pancreas morphology did not indicate improved \u03b2-cell function as a likely mechanism. Urine glucose loss was decreased with substantial improvement of diabetic nephropathy after the OA treatment. Pair-feeding the OA-treated mice to an untreated group ruled out food intake as a main factor attributable for this sustained reduction in hyperglycemia. Studies with the use of glucose tracers revealed no increase in glucose influx into muscle, adipose tissue or liver in the OA-treated mice. Finally, we analyzed key regulators of gluconeogenesis in the liver and found significant increases in the phosphorylation of both Akt and FoxO1 after treatment with OA. Importantly, these increases were significantly correlated with a down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase expression. Our findings suggest triterpenoids are a potential source of new efficacious drugs for sustained control of hyperglycemia. The liver appears to be a major site of action, possibly by the suppression of hepatic glucose production via the Akt/FoxO1 axis."

                "abstract": "Our previous study has revealed that malonyl-ginsenosides from Panax ginseng (PG-MGR) play a crucial role in the treatment of T2DM. However, its potential mechanism was still unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-diabetic mechanisms of action of PG-MGR in high fat diet-fed (HFD) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and determined the main constituents of PG-MGR responsible for its anti-diabetic effects. Our results showed that 16 malonyl ginsenosides were identified in PG-MGR by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. PG-MGR treatment significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and improved insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Simultaneously, PG-MGR treatment improved liver injury by decreasing aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) expression. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, p-AMPK/AMPK, p-ACC/ACC and GLUT4 in liver and skeletal muscle were significantly up-regulated after PG-MGR treatment, and the protein expression levels of p-IRS-1/IRS-1, Fas and SREBP-1c were significantly reduced. These findings revealed that PG-MGR has the potential to improve glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT and AMPK signal pathways."

                "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Jieduquyuziyin prescription (JP) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula. According to both TCM theory and more than a decade of clinical practice, JP has been testified to be effective for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment as an approved hospital prescription in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the effect of JP on the treatment of SLE by glucocorticoid (GC) and to further examine the molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted in vivo experiments to estimate the effect of JP on hepatic gluconeogenesis in MRL/lpr mice treated with GC. Additionally, isoproterenol (ISO) induced hepatic gluconeogenesis model and GC-treated MRL/lpr mouse hepatocytes were carried out in vitro experiments to verify the effect of JP on gluconeogenesis. RESULTS: The results showed that JP combined with GC could effectively alleviate the lupus symptoms in MRL/lpr mice and improve the pathological changes of the kidney and liver. And the combination of JP reduced the side effects caused by GC, which was related to the inhibition of GC-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis in MRL/lpr mice. Specifically, JP up-regulated the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) \u03b1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt restrained by GC to reduce the production of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), and the gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). In vivo, the use of JP either alone or with GC could reduce spleen enlargement, high levels of serum antibodies, aggravated urine protein and renal pathological damage in MRL/lpr mice. Furthermore, the glucose content was reduced in the liver of MRL/lpr mice treated with JP, and the liver damage and steatosis were also alleviated. In vitro, the expressions of PI3K and Akt increased and the expressions of FoxO1, PGC-1\u03b1, PEPCK and G6Pase decreased after JP treatment in ISO-treated hepatocytes. Compared with MRL/MP mice, we found that JP could significantly inhibit the expression of gluconeogenesis in the hepatocytes of MRL/lpr mice induced by GC to a greater extent. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of JP on GC-induced is likely related to hepatic gluconeogenesis, which provides a new perspective to reveal the positive role of JP in SLE."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bullet-induced brain wounds are common among military personnel in war zones and among civilians with gun accidents or crime-related gun injuries. The goal of this study was to develop a nonfatal porcine model of penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wound (PCGW) by firing a projectile in live swine to induce PCGW in such a realistic manner as to reconstruct their physical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a nonfatal porcine model of PCGW based on a custom-designed experimental gun that emulates the shooting of a 5.56-mm NATO standard rifle at 800 m (317 m/s; 200.9 J). Commercial swine (n = 20) were subjected to a ballistic wound to the bilateral frontal lobe, and four swine were used as controls. Surviving swine were used in subsequent first-aid, management, and monitoring experiments for neurosurgeons. Various physiological variables were measured continuously. After computed tomography (CT) scanning and three-dimensional CT reconstructions, all pigs underwent primary lifesaving emergency interventions, including emergency decompressive craniotomies and hemorrhage control. RESULTS: In our nonfatal porcine model of PCGW, injuries were comparable in their morphology to real gunshot wounds, as evidenced by analysis of wound characteristics and CT scan images. The survival rates of the pigs were 100% within 2 h, 95% within 6 h, 85% within 12 h, and 85% within 24 h (P < 0.01). Hemodynamics, hematology, blood routine biochemistry, coagulation, and other physiological parameters also exhibited significant changes in the PCGW pigs. CONCLUSIONS: This model makes possible the laboratory reproduction of real ballistic wounds in a live large animal model that is close to humans."

                "abstract": "The captive bolt gun (slaughterer's gun) is a tool used in the meat industry for \"humane killing\" of animals. Used with the intent of suicide, the captive bolt gun causes very serious injuries. We analysed 19 self-inflicted head injuries with captive bolt gun during the past 20 years. Autopsy of 20 pigs killed by this method was also performed. All 19 cases were middle-aged men from rural areas, with low level of education, and without a previous psychiatric history. Five of them used the captive bolt gun daily in their professional activities, while the remaining 14 handled it only sometimes. In seven cases suicide was primarily successful, while in five patients, despite intensive medical care, serious craniocerebral injuries eventually resulted in death. Total mortality was 63.2%. The clinical appearance of the entrance wound and the imaging characteristics of the cranial trauma are very specific, and can be easily differentiated from firearm or other penetrating injuries. These wounds were always primarily infected with mixed bacterial flora from the skin. Therefore, besides radical primary wound care, especially of the wound canal with removal of foreign bodies, it is important to administer high doses of wide spectrum antibiotics."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the application of limb tourniquet, junctional hemorrhage has outstripped extremity hemorrhage as the leading cause of death during recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. We used a gunshot wound femoral artery bleeding model to verify the effect of chain-based sponge dressing (CSD). METHODS: We used a rifle to shoot the femoral artery of female Bama miniature pigs to achieve a gunshot wound model. Pigs were immediately subjected to CSD (n\u00a0=\u00a04) or standard gauze (SG; n\u00a0=\u00a04) to achieve hemostasis. We compared outcomes between the CSD and SG groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in baseline data between the two groups. The average hemorrhage time was 38.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.29\u00a0s after CSD and 630.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0169.46\u00a0s after SG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The success rate in the CSD group was 100% (4/4), while the success rate in the SG group was 25% (1/4). The survival time of the CSD group (120\u00a0min) was significantly longer compared with the SG group (62.25\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the average time for removal of the hemostatic material between the two groups. One week after the experiment, animals had a normal diet and were walking. No secondary damage was caused by CSD. CONCLUSION: We used a gun-shot wound model to verify the effectiveness of CSD in the groin area. CSD achieved hemostasis quickly in all animals, and mean arterial pressure remained at normal levels. These findings suggest that CSD may be appropriate for humans with junctional hemorrhage due to bullet wounds, although further research is needed."

                "abstract": "We investigated wound tract extension of traumatic gunshot wounds in limb soft tissues as well as wound tract sonographic features and change-patterns when the limb position was changed. The experimental animals included 8 healthy crossbred pigs in the Chengdu plain region. Chinese Type 53 Carbine was used to establish the gunshot wound model of porcine soft tissues. Gunshot-injured zones in the soft tissues were dynamically observed at different time points using ultrasonic technology. Pathological examinations were performed for the corresponding regions for comparison and analysis. The internal echo of the wound tract was a pipe-like echo that changed over time. The wound tract extension changed with postural changes. The gas echo extended along the inside of the wound track, surrounding the fascia to further tissues. Ultrasonic imaging of gunshot wounds in pig soft tissues shows specific characteristics. The application of ultrasound technology may provide important imaging protection for gunshot wound debridement and postoperative unobstructed drainage, helping to improve the judgment and treatment of limb gunshot injuries.

                "title": "[Management of suicidal orbital gunshot wounds to the temple].",
                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Orbital gunshot wounds are rarely found after suicide. A gunshot fired at point blank range into the temple has devastating effects on all intraorbital and neighboring structures. CASE REPORTS: This article reports on two cases of gunshot wounds to the lateral orbit in attempted suicides with different weapons from 2012 and 2013 and treated at the Ruhr University Eye Hospital in Bochum. In both cases treatment was carried out in cooperation with the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Ruhr University Hospital, Bochum. In the first case a 7.65 mm gun was used. The patient presented with a double penetration of both orbits with total destruction of both globes and a reconstruction was not possible. The second patient presented with multiple shots to the head from a small caliber gun (5.6 mm) where one bullet entered the right orbit behind the globe. The bullet could be localized using computed tomography (CT) and surgically removed with preservation of the globe and with a postoperative visual acuity of 20/60. CONCLUSION: The preservation of visual function after orbital gunshot wounds depends on both the projectile channel and the characteristics of the gun and bullet. Close collaboration in surgical management between ophthalmologists, maxillofacial surgeons and neurosurgeons in specialized centers is necessary because patients often present with multiple trauma and prompt interdisciplinary treatment is needed."

                "abstract": "Throughout the course of Vukovar conflict from July, 1991, to May, 1992, there were 37 patients with war craniocerebral injuries evacuated to our Clinic. 29 patients suffered penetrating missile craniocerebral injuries, in 14 (48%) there were fragment wounds and in 15 (52%) gunshot wounds. The series was analyzed according to wounding agents, sites of head penetration, CT scan findings, neurological findings, operative and postoperative complications, and mortality. We have found significant difference in mortality between wounded who sustained fragment wounds (14%) and those with gunshot wounds (27%). Further we emphasize the necessity of CT scanning, concerning a high haematoma incidence of 27 percent. Presence of retained in-driven bone or metal fragments in our series had no influence on development of either seizure disorder or an infectious complication. This supports a thesis of a limited brain debridement as a correct approach in the treatment of penetrating missile injuries."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Firearm head injuries cause great public health concern because of their severity. They are life-threatening due to intracranial lesions and sepsis risks. This prospective study evaluates the management of craniocerebral wounds in Chad. METHODS: This is an observational study conducted over a period of 65 months with 44 patients with a ballistic craniocerebral wound (BCW), of which only 7.18% were assessed by neurosurgeons with gunshot wound. RESULTS: The mean age was 30.57 \u00b1 13 years (range:2-60 years). The 21-30 age group was the most affected (31.8%). The sex ratio was 21. A total of 63.6% of cases involved military personnel. The average admission time was 24.95 \u00b1 12 hours (range: 1-72 hours). Explosive device attacks represented 29.5% of cases, of which 53.3% occurred in civilian practice. Point-blank shooting was reported in 70.5% of cases. The entry hole of the projectile was frontal in 40.9%. Intracranial sequestration of the projectile was found in 56.8%. Association of upper limb trauma was found in 9.1% of cases. Brain scans were performed in 95.5% of cases. Surgical treatment was undertaken in 68.18% of cases. The recovery process was marked by brain abscess in 6.8% of cases. Seven deaths were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that BCW is frequent and mainly affects young male individuals in Chad. Many of the cases were related to improvised explosive device attacks, especially in civilian practice (70.5%). The delay in diagnostic and therapeutic management favors the high rate of sequelae."

                "abstract": "A total number of 64 anaesthetized Finnish homebred pigs, weighing 25-30 kg, were wounded in the medial part of one thigh. The shooting range was 30 and 100 m. The weapons were the Finnish M 62, the Russian AKM 47 and the American M 16 A 1, and the projectiles were their standard military ammunition. Simulating typical field conditions the skin of the pigs was covered with a Finnish terrain uniform at 30 m. After trauma the anaesthetized pigs were kept under intensive care for 6 hours before they were debrided on current principles of missile injury operation. The condition of the animals was carefully checked both clinically and in laboratory tests. The pigs showed no signs of shock during the study. The impact and exit velocities were measured, and the respective energies were calculated. At the range of 30 and 100 metres the rate of energy transfer was the same, or 8-9% of the impact energy, with the two 7.62 projectiles. The 5.56 American projectile had a considerably greater energy transfer at the range of 30 m (27.5% of EI) as well as at the range of 100 m (14.4 of EI). With all projectiles the same correlation was observed between debrided tissue per unit length of wound path and rate of energy transfer per unit length of wounds caused by the 5.56 calibre projectile were more injurious than those caused by the 7.62 calibre bullets. The wounds and the tissue damage were estimated by gross appearance, amount of debridement, biopsies and ultrasound studies. The results were comparable with those obtained with soap blocks, except as regards the behaviour of the Russian 7.62 calibre projectile, which was quite different in soap blocks compared to live tissue at both ranges."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Assessment of the injury potential is central to ascertaining that a law enforcement bullet does not cause unjustified and excessive injuries. There seems to prevail an understanding that tissue devitalisation correlates with kinetic energy dissipated into the tissue. Other views exist too. The purpose of the study was to find out whether such a correlation can be found and at what level of confidence. METHODS: A number of reported tests done with live pigs with sufficient primary data have first been brought to the same temporally comparable level and then analysed. The tests comprise of 140 shots. To maintain consistency tests with other animals were excluded. RESULTS: The best correlation was obtained between excised muscle tissue and dissipated kinetic energy per millimetre of wound channel. An equation describing the relationship between dissipated energy E(d) and devitalised tissue m(deb) is presented as a regression function m(deb)=44.575xE(d)+10.319 with R2=0.293. An experimental method for estimating the energy used for bullet deformation of controlled deformation bullets is also presented. CONCLUSIONS: A method for using the regression function for obtaining tissue destruction figures for any point of wound channel formed in tissue simulant is presented. The figures are intended for meaningful comparison of the injury potential of various bullets and not for forecasting actual tissue injuries. The documentation of the ballistic properties in animal tests also seems somewhat lacking. Some changes in documenting firearms injuries are proposed in order to validate the methods and further enhance the fidelity of simulant testing."

The study was conducted from November 2005 to January 2006 in Nova Scotia, Canada in forested and exposed environments, with air temperatures between -10 degrees C and +10 degrees C. Pigs were used as human models and were shot six times each at three different ranges (contact, 2.5 cm, and 1.5 m). Gunshot wound characteristics persisted until the wounds were covered with ice and snow, after which changes were observed. The changes were recognized as being unique to the different ranges of gunshots and it was concluded that changes due to decomposition under the conditions tested would not affect the collection and interpretation of gunshot wound evidence."

We studied possible mechanism of firearm injury formation as a consequence of using firearm on the body, to present a more comprehensive material in wound ballistics. We pointed out possible actions of a projectile causes on human, respectively other animal organisms, as well as to a manner in which an injury is caused by rifles or shotguns using non-lethal ammunition with rubber projectiles. In the experiment, we have focused on macroscopic analysis of the tissue penetrated by a rubber projectile fired from a long firearm and pump-action shotgun while focusing on the anatomical-morphological analysis of entry wounds to determine the effectiveness respectively, the wounding potential of the projectile. The results of the experiment based on the macroscopic analysis of entry wounds, cavities and exit wounds, show that when a rubber projectile penetrates the body it causes loss of the tissue (i.e. the minus effect) and mechanical disruption of the tissue similar to lethal projectile. Based on the measures and ballistic computations we concluded that in specific cases, like for example in a close range hit, a penetration of vital organs can cause serious or even lethal injuries."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Behind armor blunt trauma (BABT) describes a nonpenetrating injury to the organs of an individual wearing body armor. The aim of this study was to investigate the neurologic and functional changes that occur in the central nervous system after high-velocity BABT of the spine as well as its biomechanical characteristics. METHODS: This study evaluated 28 healthy adult white pigs. Animals were randomly divided into three experimental groups: (1) 15 animals (9 in the exposed group and 6 in the control group) were tested for neurologic changes; (2) 10 animals (5 in the exposed group and 5 in the control group) were used for studies of cognitive function; (3) and 3 animals were used for examination of biomechanics. In the group tested for neurologic changes, 9 anesthetized pigs wearing body armor (including a ceramic plate and polyethylene body armor) on the back were shot on the eighth thoracic vertebrae (T8) with a 5.56-mm rifle bullet (velocity appropriately 910 m/s). As a control, six pigs were shot with blank ammunition. Ultrastructural changes of the spinal cord and brain tissue were observed with light and electron microscopy. Expression levels of myelin basic protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and glial cytoplasmic protein (S-100B) were investigated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were monitored before and 10 minutes after the shot. Pressures in the spine, common carotid artery, and brain were detected. Acceleration of the 10th vertebrae (T10) was tested. Finally, cognitive outcomes between exposed and control groups were compared. RESULTS: Neuronal degeneration and nerve fiber demyelination were seen in the spinal cord. The concentrations of neuron-specific enolase, myelin basic protein, and S-100B were significantly increased in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid 3 hours after trauma (p < 0.05). The electroencephalogram was suppressed within 3 to 6 minutes after trauma. The pressure detected in the brain was higher than that detected in the common carotid artery (p < 0.01). The trauma resulted in paralysis of two hind limbs and in cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: The results from our animal model indicate that high-velocity BABT of the spine generates high pressure and acceleration in the spine, induces varying degrees of paralysis of hind limbs, and disturbs cerebral function. The neuronal degeneration caused by the pressure wave may be one of the important pathologic events involved in the development of trauma-related complications."

                "abstract": "For the purpose of comparing the properties of a particular soft soap with those of live muscle tissue, a comparative study was carried out, involving firings into live, anesthetized pigs and into blocks of soft soap. The weapon - ammunition combinations utilized were Ak 4 - sk ptr 10 prj - the Swedish version of 7.62 mm NATO assault rifle M16A1- M. 193 - the U.S. standard weapon, calibre 5.56 mm. The registrations were done by flash X-ray units of 105 and 150 kilovolts, mounted in an orthogonal stereo set-up with 8-11 units, making it possible to obtain 4 to 6 measurements of bullet position, yaw angle etc. during the penetration of the target in one shot. By evaluation of these firings, and by \"pooling\" of the data for each series it was possible to calculate retardation force on the bullet as a function of penetration depth for the soap targets, and for the live targets. The results show that no significant difference can be discerned between the soft soap and animal tissue as regards their influence on the behaviour of the bullet."

                "abstract": "Previous studies document characteristics of gunshot wounds shortly after they were inflicted. This study was conducted to determine if the early stages of decomposition obscure or alter the physical surface characteristics of gunshot wounds, thereby affecting the quantity and quality of information retrievable from such evidence. The study was conducted in August and September, 2005 in Nova Scotia, Canada in forested and exposed environments. Recently killed pigs were used as research models and were shot six times each at three different ranges (contact, 2.5 cm, and 1.5 m). Under these test conditions, the gunshot wounds maintained the characteristics unique to each gunshot range and changes that occurred during decomposition were not critical to the interpretation of the evidence. It was concluded that changes due to decomposition under the conditions tested would not affect the collection and interpretation of gunshot wound evidence until the skin was degraded in the late active or advanced decay stage of decomposition."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effects of various types and diameters of guns and related treatment principles are different. Our study was performed to experimentally demonstrate the effects of different gunshots in body tissues. METHODS: 9x19 mm hand-gun and 7.62x51 mm G-3 infantry rifle were used in the study. Injury models were created through hand-gun and rifle shootings at isolated soft tissue, lower extremity, liver and intestine tissue simulants made of ballistic candle. High-speed cameras were used to capture 1000 frames per second. Images were examined and wound mechanisms were evaluated. RESULTS: It was observed that the colon content distributed more within the surrounding tissues by the rifle shootings comparing with hand-gun shootings and could be an infection source due to the large size of the cavity in the colon. Especially when the bullets hitting the bone were investigated, it was seen that much more tissue injury occurs with high speed bullets due to bullet deformation and fragmentation. However, no significant difference was found between the effect of hand-gun and rifle bullets passing through the extremity without hitting the bone. CONCLUSION: To know the type of the gun that caused the injury and its characteristics will allow to estimate severity and size of the injury before the treatment and to focus on different alternatives of treatment. Therefore, use of appropriate models is required in experimental studies."

                "abstract": "The aim of the study is to justify the \"balanced\" approach to brain debridement (BD) in surgical treatment of combat-related penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wound (PCGW) patients and assess immediate and long-term treatment results. The analysis of applied surgical BD techniques was performed in PCGW military personnel with admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4 or above. The study included 81 injured patients. Average GCS score at admission was 10\u00b13. Blunt injuries were predominant (n=51, 62.9%). Bone fragments were removed in 78 (92.8%) and metal foreign bodies were removed in 32 (38.1%)cases. Demographic and clinical characteristics, nature of brain injury, presence of foreign bodies and depth of their location, surgery extent, and occurrence of complications in postoperative period were taken into account. The outcome data included a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge, in 6 and 12 months, grade of speech disorders, extremities strength, and occurrence of convulsive attacks from the time of admission to 12 months. Meningitis developed in 11 (13.6%) cases. 11 (13.6%) patients died. Good recovery (GOS score 4-5) in 12 months was in 8 (38.1%) patients, moderate disability (GOS score 4) in 10 (47.6%) patients. Adverse outcome (GOS score 1-3) was associated with axial dislocation (p=0.015), diametric wound (p<0.001), and purulent-septic complications (PSC) (p<0.05). Intracranial PSCs are statistically significantly associated with duration of subdural space inflow and outflow drainage of 4+ days (p<0.05), bone fragments left in the brain matter (p=0.008), and ventricular hemorrhage on HCT (p=0.016). The choice of a BD technique depended on severity of patient's condition, brain injury, and presence of foreign bodies. Availability of an equipped operating room allowed for thorough surgery. Good outcome indicators testify to appropriateness of the chosen tactic."

                "abstract": "Penetrating brain injury (PBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in modern warfare and accounts for a significant number of traumatic brain injuries worldwide. Here we characterize the pathophysiology of a new rat model of PBI that simulates the large temporary cavity caused by energy dissipation from a penetrating bullet round. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were subjected to a simulated ballistic wound to the right frontal hemisphere implemented by an inflatable penetrating probe. Three levels of injury severity were compared to control animals. Neurological and physiological outcome was assessed over a 3-day recovery period and brain tissue collected at 72 h for histopathological evaluation. Brain-injured regions included the ipsilateral frontal cortex and striatum with volumetric increases in intracranial hemorrhage (5-18 mm3) and lesion size (9-86 mm3) related to severity. Similarly, hemispheric swelling increased (3-14%) following PBI, associated with a significant rise in intracranial pressure. Astrogliosis was present in regions adjacent to the core-injury along with microglial and leukocyte infiltration. Injury remote to the lesion was observed in the cerebral peduncle that may have accounted, in part, for observed neurological deficits. Neurological and balance beam testing revealed sensorimotor deficits that persisted through 72 h. Severe electroencephalographic disturbances included the occurrence of cortical spreading depression, slow-waves, and brain seizure activity. In conclusion, this rat PBI model replicates diverse, salient features of clinical PBI pathology, generates reproducible and quantifiable measures of outcome, and is scalable by injury severity, rendering it an attractive vehicle for experimental brain trauma research."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Gunshot wounds are frequently studied using computed tomography (CT) to examine tissue damage. In this study, we aimed to test the potential of post-mortem CT (PMCT) in shooting distance estimation at distances 0-100\u00a0cm. We hypothesized that in addition to the wound channel, we could also potentially detect tissue damage caused by muzzle pressure on PMCT. RESULTS: A total of 59 gunshot wounds (23 contact shots, 21 close-range shots, 15 distant shots) were inflicted on eight piglet carcasses with a .22 Long Rifle handgun. PMCT scans were obtained using clinical equipment, and they were evaluated for wound characteristics by visual inspection and numeric measurements. In our data, contact shots could be clearly distinguished from close-range and distant shots by a hyperdense ring-shaped area surrounding the outermost part of the wound channel. Close-range and distant shot wounds did not have this feature and were difficult to distinguish from each other. The mean wound channel diameter ranged from 3.4 to 5.4\u00a0mm, being smallest in contact shots and largest in distant shots. These preliminary findings suggest that PMCT may aid the estimation of shooting distance. As this study only addressed low velocity gunshot wounds in carcasses, further studies are warranted."

The protective vest may impede the projectile, but some of the kinetic energy is transferred to the body, causing internal injuries and occasionally death. The aim in this study was to investigate changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) and physiologic parameters after high-velocity BABT. METHODS: Eight anesthetized pigs, wearing body armor (including a ceramic plate) on the right side of their thorax, were shot with a 7.62-mm assault rifle (velocity approximately 800 m/s). The shots did not penetrate the armor and these animals were compared with control animals (n = 4), shot with blank ammunition. EEG and several physiologic parameters were thereafter monitored during a 2-hour period after the shot. RESULTS: All animals survived during the experimental period. Five of the exposed animals showed a temporary effect on EEG. Furthermore, exposed animals displayed decreased cardiac capacity and an impaired oxygenation of the blood. Postmortem examination revealed subcutaneous hematomas and crush injuries to the right lung. CONCLUSION: The results in our animal model indicate that high-velocity BABT induce circulatory and respiratory dysfunction, and in some cases even transient cerebral functional disturbances."

                "abstract": "The principles of management of civilian gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the head and spine have evolved directly from the experience gained in war by military neurosurgeons. The type of craniocerebral wounds being produced in urban gang warfare and suicide at tempts using handguns or rifles at close range vary considerably from the lower velocity fragment injuries which are common in modern warfare. Civilian craniocerebral GSWs are often devastating. The in-hospital mortality for civilians with penetrating craniocerebral injury is 52-95% depending on the proportion of suicide victims in the series. The most important predictive factor is the post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Many civilian victims (47%) present with GCS 3-5 and only approximately 8.1% survive. Of these survivors, 1.4% will have nil, mild or moderate disability without surgery and 4.8% with surgery. Higher post-resuscitation GCS is associated with a significantly improved survival: GCS 6-8, 35.6% and GCS 9-15, 90.5%. A selective treatment policy is recommended for the patients with GCS 3-5. There are many clinical and radiological correlates with poor outcome that help the neurosurgeon decide on operative versus supportive treatment. Early aggressive resuscitation, surgery and vigorous control of intracranial pressure offers the best chance of achieving a satisfactory outcome. Spinal GSWs are uncommon and the neurosurgeon should be aware of the principles of management and prognosis. The indication for acute spinal cord decompression is deteriorating neurological status. Steroids are not indicated for these injuries. Neurosurgeons should take an active role in formulating and supporting public policy which aims to reduce possession and usage of firearms and therefore the prevalence of gunshot injuries."

A self-made metal column, which was heated in a boiling water bath, was applied for different time periods to the lower back of rats of different ages in burn creation. Wounds were observed visibly at different time points postburn. Biopsies were obtained and examined at 72-hour postburn to determine the depth of burns. The contact durations producing the desired depth of injury in the rat model under constant temperature and pressure were: 3 seconds (deep second degree) and 5 seconds (third degree) in 1-month-old rats; 3 seconds (superficial second degree), 5 seconds (deep second degree), and 7-9 seconds (third degree) in 2-month-old rats; 3-5 seconds (superficial second degree), 7-9 seconds (deep second degree), and 11-13 seconds (third degree) in 12- and 18-month-old rats. This reliable and reproducible experimental model produces consistent burn injuries in rats of different ages by regulating the contact durations, which will help us to understand the underlying pathophysiology of burn injuries and develop novel therapeutic modalities for burn patients of different ages."

There is a constant need to understand the physiopathology of burns, so as to minimize their devastating results. The objective of the present report is to describe a burn apparatus in association with an innovative method of animal fixation, as to produce burns of varying sizes and depths. METHODS: Rats were subjected to burns of 60 \u00b0C, 70 \u00b0C, and 80 \u00b0C for 10 s and after 3 days half of the rats in each group were killed and the resulting lesions were analyzed using histological techniques. In the other half of the rats the wound was measured weakly until complete re-epithelialization. RESULTS: All burns were easily visible and the histological feature for the 60 \u00b0C burn was a superficial second-degree burn (28% of the dermis), for 70 \u00b0C we observed a deep second-degree burn (72% of the dermis), and in the 80 \u00b0C group, a third degree-burn was present (100% of the dermis). CONCLUSIONS: This is a safe, reliable, easy to construct and use model that has the ability to produce a regular and uniform reproducible burn due to precise temperature control associated with standardized animal positioning."

METHODS: High pressure steam apparatus consisting of an autoclave and a self-made scalding frame was employed in the study. The rats were inflicted with scalding with 0.12 Mpa (1 Mpa = 7500 mmHg) high pressure steam on the back through a hole of 2.6 cm in diameter for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 seconds, with five wounds at each time point. The tissue samples were harvested at 24 post injury hour (PIH) for pathomorphological examination. The depth of scald was measured, and injury to the sweat gland and hair follicles injury, the hair growth in scalded area, and the wound healing condition were observed with Photoshop software. RESULTS: There was positive correlation between the scalding depth and scalding time. The injury time for superficial and deep partial thickness burn and full thickness burn were 3, 5 and 7 seconds respectively. The wound healing time was similar even the scalding became more and more serious when injury time increased from 7 to 10 seconds. CONCLUSION: The scalding depth and area in this model could be controlled, and the degree of scald injury could be graded accurately with easy manipulation. The result showed that it was an ideal model of skin burn wound."

We used the more human-like ventral skin to create burns of different depths. Contact burns were created to 11 pigs using a brass plate heated to 100 degrees C in boiling water. Different contact times were used to create burns of different depths. In pigs 1-6, the follow-up time was 72 h and in pigs 7-11 24 h. Burn depth was determined by histology. Histologically, samples were classified into five anatomical layers: epidermis, upper one-third of the dermis, middle third of the dermis, deepest third of the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The location of both thromboses and burn marks were evaluated, respectively. The 1 s contact time lead to a superficial thermal injury, 3 s to a partial thickness and 9 s to a full thickness injury. A progression of burn depth was found until 48 h post-injury. The intra-observer correlation after repeated histological analyses of burn depths by the same histopathologist and the repeatability of burn depth creation yielded kappa coefficients 0.83 and 0.92, respectively.

We have developed a robust porcine burn model capable of creating reproducible scald burns for a wide range of burn conditions. The study was conducted with juvenile Large White pigs, creating replicates of burn combinations; 50\u00b0C for 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes and 60\u00b0C, 70\u00b0C, 80\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C for 5 seconds. Visual wound examination, biopsies and Laser Doppler Imaging were performed at 1, 24 hours and at 3 and 7 days post-burn. A consistent water temperature was maintained within the scald device for long durations (49.8 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C when set at 50\u00b0C). The macroscopic and histologic appearance was consistent between replicates of burn conditions. For 50\u00b0C water, 10 minute duration burns showed significantly deeper tissue injury than all shorter durations at 24 hours post-burn (p \u2264 0.0001), with damage seen to increase until day 3 post-burn. For 5 second duration burns, by day 7 post-burn the 80\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C scalds had damage detected significantly deeper in the tissue than the 70\u00b0C scalds (p \u2264 0.001). A reliable and safe model of porcine scald burn injury has been successfully developed. The novel apparatus with continually refreshed water improves consistency of scald creation for long exposure times. This model allows the pathophysiology of scald burn wound creation and progression to be examined. "

                "abstract": "Despite advances in perfusion imaging, burn wound imaging technology continues to lag behind that of other fields. Quantification of blood flow is able to predict time for healing, but clear assessment of burn depth is still questionable. Active dynamic thermography (ADT) is a noncontact imaging modality capable of distinguishing tissue of different thermal conductivities. Utilizing the abnormal heat transfer properties of the burn zones, we examined whether ADT was useful in the determination of burn depth in a model of early burn wound evaluation. Duroc pigs (castrated male; n = 3) were anesthetized, and two burns were created with an aluminum billet at 3 and 12 seconds. These contact times resulted in superficial partial and deep partial thickness burn wounds, respectively. ADT and laser Doppler imaging (LDI) imaging were performed every 30 minutes postburn for a total of five imaging sessions ending 150 minutes postburn. For ADT, imaging excitation was performed for 42-120 seconds with dual quartz-infrared lamps, and subsequent infrared image capture was performed for 300 seconds. MATLAB-assisted image analysis was performed to determine burn zone region of interest thermal relaxation and characteristic patterns. LDI was performed with a moorLDI system, and biopsies were captured for histology following the 150-minute imaging session. Both ADT and LDI imaging modalities are able to detect different physical properties at 30, 60, 90 120, and 150 minutes postburn with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Resultant ADT cooling curves characterize greater differences with greater stimulation and a potentially more identifiable differential cooling characteristic. Histological analysis confirmed burn depth. This preliminary work confirms that ADT can measure burn depth and is deserving of further research either as a stand-alone imaging technology or in combination with a device to assess perfusion. "

                "abstract": "Deep dermal burn injuries require extensive medical care; however, the water temperatures and durations of exposure that result in a severe scald injury are unknown. This study used a porcine burn model to investigate the time and temperature threshold for clinically relevant deep dermal injuries for both immersion (long duration) and spill/splash (short duration) scald events. Scald wounds were created on the flanks of anaesthetized juvenile large White pigs (27\u00a0kg). Acute tissue injury evaluations performed at 1\u00a0hour and days 1, 3, and 7 postburn (16 pigs) included: wound examination, biopsies, and laser Doppler imaging. Up to 20 burn combinations were tested including: 50-60\u2009\u00b0C water for 1-10 minutes (immersion); and 60-90\u2009\u00b0C water for 5\u00a0seconds (spill/splash). Burn conditions demonstrating mid-to-deep dermal damage histologically were followed for 21\u00a0days to assess time to reepithelialize (eight pigs). Histologically, depth of damage increased until day 3 postburn. Damage to \u226575% of the depth of dermis was associated with burns taking longer than 3\u00a0weeks to fully reepithelialize. For spill/splash (5\u00a0seconds) scalds, water at \u226575\u2009\u00b0C showed damage to mid-dermis or deeper by day 3; however, only burns from water \u226585\u2009\u00b0C were not reepithelialized by day 21. For immersion scalds of equivalent duration, water at 55\u2009\u00b0C caused significantly deeper dermal damage than 50\u2009\u00b0C (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at day 3. Immersion scalds that were not fully reepithelialized by day 21 included 50\u2009\u00b0C for >10\u00a0minutes, 55\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u00a0minutes, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u00a0seconds, and 70\u2009\u00b0C for\u2009>\u200915 seconds. This research provides valuable evidence-based injury prediction data, which can be used to inform future burn injury prevention guidelines/legislation to reduce the risk of severe scald injuries and support medicolegal opinions for cases where an inflicted mechanism of injury is alleged."

The objective of this study was to describe a new model for inducing deep partial-thickness burns in rats. Burn wounds were performed on the dorsal part of Sprague-Dawley rats using a constructed heating device in our laboratory. Digital images of each animal were captured every day for macroscopic evaluation and for assessment of the wound contraction rate. Six animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 7, 11, 14, and 21 after onset of burn and their skin tissues were harvested for histological analysis. Uniform deep partial-thickness burns could be achieved in Sprague-Dawley rats under the condition of a contact temperature of 70\u00b0C, with the weight of heating devices of 300 g, and a duration of 10 s. Macroscopic evaluation recorded the general appearance of the deep partial-thickness burns. Evaluation of the wound contraction rate showed that the deep partial-thickness wound area was reduced by 90.39% of the original wound area by day 21 after burn. Microscopic evaluation by hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed the histological changes during the wound healing process. This is a standardized and reproducible model for inducing deep partial-thickness burns in Sprague-Dawley rats."

Most of the experimental systems used today are unable to produce precise partial thickness burns. This limits the ability to study minor changes associated with burn care. The aim of the study was to develop a method for generating burns with a fixed depth using a CO2 laser burn generation system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The burn generation system was composed of two components: a burn generation device and a temperature sensing and control system. These components were designed to operate together in order to keep a constant, predetermined skin surface temperature during prolonged burn generation. One hundred thirty-eight spot burns were generated on the back of five shaved 450 g male Wistar rats. The rat skin was exposed to a 70 degrees C for 5-60 seconds. The burned areas were excised and underwent evaluation by hematoxylin-eosin-stained slide microscopy. RESULTS: A linear correlation was found between the duration of exposure and the average burn depth (r = 0.93). This correlation is represented by the equation: burn depth in millimeters = 0.012x (duration in seconds of skin exposure at 70 degrees C). CONCLUSIONS: The fiber-optic-controlled laser burn generation system studied is a reliable tool for creating partial thickness as well as full thickness skin burns in rats."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OJECTIVES: The current standard for diagnosis of burn severity and subsequent wound healing is through clinical examination, which is highly subjective. Several new technologies are shifting focus to burn care in an attempt to help quantify not only burn depth but also the progress of healing. While accurate early assessment of partial thickness burns is critical for dictating the course of treatment, the ability to quantitatively monitor wound status over time is critical for understanding treatment efficacy. SFDI and LSI are both non-invasive imaging modalities that have been shown to have great diagnostic value for burn severity, but have yet to be tested over the course of wound healing. METHODS: In this study, a hairless rat model (n\u2009=\u20096, 300-450\u2009g) was used with a four pronged comb to create four identical partial thickness burns (superficial n\u2009=\u20093 and deep n\u2009=\u20093) that were used to monitor wound healing over a 28 days period. Weekly biopsies were taken for histological analysis to verify wound progression. Both SFDI and LSI were performed weekly to track the evolution of hemodynamic (blood flow and oxygen saturation) and structural (reduced scattering coefficient) properties for the burns. RESULTS: LSI showed significant changes in blood flow from baseline to 220% in superficial and 165% in deep burns by day 7. In superficial burns, blood flow returned to baseline levels by day 28, but not for deep burns where blood flow remained elevated. Smaller increases in blood flow were also observed in the surrounding tissue over the same time period. Oxygen saturation values measured with SFDI showed a progressive increase from baseline values of 66-74% in superficial burns and 72% in deep burns by day 28. Additionally, SFDI showed significant decreases in the reduced scattering coefficient shortly after the burns were created. The scattering coefficient progressively decreased in the wound area, but returned towards baseline conditions at the end of the 28 days period. Scattering changes in the surrounding tissue remained constant despite the presence of hemodynamic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that LSI and SFDI are capable of monitoring changes in hemodynamic and scattering properties in burn wounds over a 28 days period. These results highlight the potential insights that can be gained by using non-invasive imaging technologies to study wound healing. Further development of these technologies could be revolutionary for wound monitoring and studying the efficacy of different treatments. Lasers Surg.

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Scarring following full thickness burns leads to significant reductions in range of motion and quality of life for burn patients. To effectively study scar development and the efficacy of anti-scarring treatments in a large animal model (female red Duroc pigs), reproducible, uniform, full-thickness, burn wounds are needed to reduce variability in observed results that occur with burn depth. Prior studies have proposed that initial temperature of the burner, contact time with skin, thermal capacity of burner material, and the amount of pressure applied to the skin need to be strictly controlled to ensure reproducibility. The purpose of this study was to develop a new burner that enables temperature and pressure to be digitally controlled and monitored in real-time throughout burn wound creation and compare it to a standard burn device. METHODS: A custom burn device was manufactured with an electrically heated burn stylus and a temperature control feedback loop via an electronic microstat. Pressure monitoring was controlled by incorporation of a digital scale into the device, which measured downward force. The standard device was comprised of a heat resistant handle with a long rod connected to the burn stylus, which was heated using a hot plate. To quantify skin surface temperature and internal stylus temperature as a function of contact time, the burners were heated to the target temperature (200\u00b15\u00b0C) and pressed into the skin for 40s to create the thermal injuries. Time to reach target temperature and elapsed time between burns were recorded. In addition, each unit was evaluated for reproducibility within and across three independent users by generating burn wounds at contact times spanning from 5 to 40s at a constant pressure and at pressures of 1 or 3lbs with a constant contact time of 40s. Biopsies were collected for histological analysis and burn depth quantification using digital image analysis (ImageJ). RESULTS: The custom burn device maintained both its internal temperature and the skin surface temperature near target temperature throughout contact time. In contrast, the standard burner required more than 20s of contact time to raise the skin surface temperature to target due to its quickly decreasing internal temperature. The custom burner was able to create four consecutive burns in less than half the time of the standard burner. Average burn depth scaled positively with time and pressure in both burn units. However, the distribution of burn depth within each time-pressure combination in the custom device was significantly smaller than with the standard device and independent of user. CONCLUSIONS: The custom burn device's ability to continually heat the burn stylus and actively control pressure and temperature allowed for more rapid and reproducible burn wounds. Burns of tailored and repeatable depths, independent of user, provide a platform for the study of anti-scar and other wound healing therapies without the added variable of non-uniform starting injury."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burn infliction techniques are poorly described in rat models. An accurate study can only be achieved with wounds that are uniform in size and depth. We describe a simple reproducible method for creating consistent burn wounds in rats. METHODS: Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and dorsum shaved. A 100 g cylindrical stainless-steel rod (1 cm diameter) was heated to 100\u2103 in boiling water. Temperature was monitored using a thermocouple. We performed two consecutive toe-pinch tests on different limbs to assess the depth of sedation. Burn infliction was limited to the loin. The skin was pulled upwards, away from the underlying viscera, creating a flat surface. The rod rested on its own weight for 5, 10, and 20 seconds at three different sites on each rat. Wounds were evaluated for size, morphology and depth. RESULTS: Average wound size was 0.9957 cm(2) (standard deviation [SD] 0.1845) (n=30). Wounds created with duration of 5 seconds were pale, with an indistinct margin of erythema. Wounds of 10 and 20 seconds were well-defined, uniformly brown with a rim of erythema. Average depths of tissue damage were 1.30 mm (SD 0.424), 2.35 mm (SD 0.071), and 2.60 mm (SD 0.283) for duration of 5, 10, 20 seconds respectively. Burn duration of 5 seconds resulted in full-thickness damage. Burn duration of 10 seconds and 20 seconds resulted in full-thickness damage, involving subjacent skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: This is a simple reproducible method for creating burn wounds consistent in size and depth in a rat burn model."

The current classification into first-, second-, and third-degree burns is crude, making comparisons between studies difficult. The authors standardized a reproducible burn model and a precise histopathologic method for describing burn depth in swine. METHODS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional interventional animal study. Eighteen paired sets of burns were inflicted on the clipped flank skin of two anesthetized domestic pigs with a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm by 7.5 cm aluminum bar preheated in water to 50 degrees C, 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C, 90 degrees C, degrees C or 100 degrees C. The bar was applied for 10, 20, or 30 seconds. Full-thickness skin biopsies were obtained 30 minutes after injury for blinded histopathologic evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Two dermatopathologists made two sets of measurements and were masked to each other's evaluations. The depth of injury was measured with an ocular microtome for each of five dermal parameters: collagen discoloration, intercollagen basophilic material, endothelial cell necrosis, epithelial cell necrosis, and mesenchymal cell necrosis. The correlation between burn depths of the paired sets of experiments was calculated to assess the reliability of the model. Inter- and intraobserver correlations were calculated to assess the reliability of the scale. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the relation between temperature and exposure times on burn depth. RESULTS: Depth of injury for all five dermal elements was related to temperature and exposure times (ANOVA, p < 0.001 for each). The depth of injury in the paired sets of burns was highly consistent (Pearson correlation, range = 0.88-0.95). Inter- and intraobserver correlations were excellent for all measured elements (range = 0.91-0.97 and 0.95-0.99, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe a simple and reproducible animal burn model and histopathologic scale for measuring burn depth that they believe will facilitate standardization and comparison within future burn studies."

(2) The subcutaneous temperature of the back was monitored at different time and temperatures of heat contacting by placing the thermometer under the fascia of the rat back. RESULTS: (1) The time of burn wound formation was shortened and the injury degree deepened along with the increase in the contact temperature. The rat skin density exhibited irregular hyperbola or triple curves. (2) The subcutaneous temperature exhibited a parabolic curve with fixed experimental conditions. CONCLUSION: (1) The sharp increase in subcutaneous temperature leading to degeneration and necrosis might be the primary cause of deep burn.

                "abstract": "Multiple animal models of burn injury have been reported, and only some of these have been fully validated. One of the most popular approaches is burn infliction by direct contact with the heat source. Previous investigators have reported that the pressure of application of the contact burn infliction device does not affect the depth of injury. We hypothesized that the depth of injury would increase with increasing pressure of application in a porcine burn model. Forty mid-dermal contact burns measuring 25 x 25 mm were created on the back and flanks of an anesthetized domestic pig (50 kg) using a brass bar preheated in 80 degrees C water for a period of 30 or 20 seconds. The bars were applied using a spring-loaded device designed to control the amount of pressure applied to the skin. The pressures applied by the brass bar were gravity (0.2 kg), 2.0, 2.7, 3.8, and 4.5 kg in replicates of eight. One hour later, 8-mm full-thickness biopsies were obtained for histologic analysis using Elastic Van Gieson staining by a board-certified dermatopathologist masked to burn conditions. The depth of complete and partial collagen injury was measured from the level of the basement membrane using a microscopic micrometer measuring lens. Groups were compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA). The association between depth of injury and pressure was determined with Pearson correlations. The mean (95% confidence interval) depths of complete collagen injury with 30-second exposures were as follows: gravity only, 0.51 (0.39-0.66) mm; 2.0 kg, 0.72 (0.55-0.88) mm; 2.7 kg, 0.68 (0.55-1.00) mm; 3.8 kg, 0.92 (0.80-1.00) mm; and 4.5 kg, 1.65 (1.55-1.75) mm. The differences in depth of injury between the various pressure groups were significant (ANOVA, P < .001). The mean (95% confidence interval) depths of partial collagen injury were as follows: gravity only, 1.10 (0.92-1.30) mm; 2.0 kg, 1.46 (1.28-1.63) mm; 2.7 kg, 1.51 (1.34-1.64) mm; 3.8 kg, 1.82 (1.71-1.94) mm; and 4.5 kg, 2.50 (2.39-2.62) mm; and ANOVA, P = .001. The associations between pressure of application and depth of complete and partial collagen injury were 0.73 (P < .001) and 0.65 (P < .001), respectively. There is a direct association between the pressure of burn device application and depth of injury. Future studies should standardize and specify the amount of pressure applied using the burn infliction device."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate burn depth assessment is important for determining the appropriate treatment plan for severe burn patients. However, conventional methods of diagnoses, such as visual observation and pinprick test, are often inaccurate. We previously proposed a new method for burn diagnosis in which photoacoustic signals originating from the blood in healthy tissue under the injured tissue are measured. In this study, we investigated the validity of this method by an experiment using rat scald burn models. METHODS: Superficial dermal burns (SDBs), deep dermal burns (DDBs), and deep burns (DBs) were made in the dorsal skin of rats by using a Walker-Mason template. Wounds were irradiated with low-energy, 550-nm, nanosecond pulsed light, and photoacoustic signals induced were measured with a piezoelectric film as a function of postburn time. Measurement in normal skin as a control was also performed. Temporal profiles of the photoacoustic signals were converted into depth profiles using sound velocity of tissue, and for each profile, a peak showing highest signal intensity was selected. For this peak, the depth at which the signal rose (signal rise depth) and the depth that gave a peak value (signal peak depth) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to clarify the difference in depth information of signals between burn groups. RESULTS: Depth profiles of photoacoustic signals showed unique features depending on the degree of burn; pronounced peaks shifted to deeper tissue as the burn severity increased. This indicates that the zone of stasis formed due to injuries can be monitored. There were significant differences in both the signal rise depth and the peak depth between the control and SDB groups, SDB and DDB groups, and DDB and DB groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: SDBs, DDBs, and DBs can be differentiated by photoacoustic signals, suggesting that the method proposed is useful for diagnosing burn injuries."

However, manual burn creation is subject to human variability. We developed a new device that can control the temperature, time, and pressure of contact to produce precise and reproducible animal burn wounds and investigated the conditions required to prepare various burn wounds using our new device. METHODS: We prepared burn wounds on F344 rats using 3 contact times 2, 4, and 10 seconds using a stamp heated to 80\u00b0C. We observed the wound-healing process macroscopically and histologically and evaluated the burn depth using a laser speckle contrast-imaging device, which evaluated the blood flow of the wound. RESULTS: The changes in the burned area over time, tissue perfusion of the burn wounds, histological evaluation of the burn depth by hematoxylin-eosin and azocarmine and aniline blue staining, and the epithelialization rate (the ratio of the epithelialized area to the wound length) were evaluated on histological sections. Results indicated that the burn wounds prepared with contact times of 2, 4, and 10 seconds corresponded to superficial dermal burns, deep dermal burns, and full-thickness burns, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that partial- and full-thickness burn wounds can be precisely and reproducibly created with our new automated burning device."

The purpose of our study was to assess the adequacy of the turkey as a large animal model for flexor tendon injuries in vivo. Twenty-four male turkeys underwent surgical flexor tendon cut and repair. Turkeys were allocated to five groups postoperatively: (1) foot casted in extension and sacrificed after 3 weeks; (2) foot casted in extension and sacrificed after 6 weeks; (3) foot casted in flexion and sacrificed after 3 weeks; (4) foot casted in flexion and sacrificed after 6 weeks; and (5) foot casted in flexion for 6 weeks and then free roaming allowed for an additional 3 weeks before sacrifice. After sacrifice, digits were collected and analyzed for adhesion formation, healing at the macrolevel and histologically, and biomechanical properties-including friction, work of flexion, stiffness, and strength of repair. All turkeys survived anesthesia and surgery. Tendon rupture occurred in all extension casts and in 11% of those casted in flexion. Friction and work of flexion were significantly higher in the repaired digit than the control digit. There was a correlation between duration of immobilization and repair strength. Histologically, the tendon healed with tenocytes migrating into the gap and producing collagen fibers. We have, for the first time, studied flexor tendon injury and repair using turkeys in terms of anesthesia, surgical procedures, postoperative care, and animal husbandry. The findings regarding functional and histological results from this novel avian model were comparable to the most commonly used mammal model. \u00a9 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

One hundred and twenty flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons were lacerated to 80% of their cross-section and repaired with either a modified Kessler (MK) or Becker (MGH) repair. The postoperative therapeutic regimen was either synergistic wrist and digit motion (SWM) or passive digit flexion and extension with the wrist fixed in 45 degrees of flexion (FIX). The dogs were sacrificed at one, three, or six weeks postoperatively. Thirty six FDP tendons from normal paws served as the control group, with each control tendon tested in two different conditions: intact and immediately after partial laceration and repair (0 time), making a total of five different timing points (intact, 0 time, one week, three weeks, and six weeks) for each repair type and each postoperative therapy. Frictional force between tendon and proximal pulley was evaluated after breaking any adhesions. Compared to intact tendons, friction was significantly increased immediately after tendon repair. The friction of the MK repair was significantly less than that of the MGH repair at all time and therapy groups, except at six weeks in the SWM group. For the MGH repair, at six weeks friction in the SWM group was significantly less than friction in the FIX group. This study showed that postoperative tendon gliding depends on the method of tendon repair and the postoperative therapy regimen. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the gliding surface after tendon repair remodels with time."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tendon healing is a complex and coordinated event involving the activation of extrinsic mechanisms as in classic reparative skin wound healing as well as intrinsic mechanisms characteristic of regenerative wound healing. Despite improvements in surgical and rehabilitative techniques, tendon adhesions remain the most frequent cause of disability following tendon surgery. In this animal model, we evaluated the use of a clinically available, biocompatible collagen- glycosaminoglycan (GAG) material as an adjunct to surgical tendon repair. METHODS: Thirty-two white leghorn chickens underwent surgical tendon repair of their left second and fourth digits. Digits were randomized to study and control groups. In both groups, the long flexor tendon was divided and repaired using a modified Kessler's repair. In the study group, collagen-GAG membrane was wrapped around the repair site. Animals were immobilized with a plaster cast and sacrificed at 3 wk. Sixteen animals had their tendon repair sites histologically assessed and graded for healing and adhesion formation. Eight animals had their tendon repairs assessed for quantification of the work associated with flexion, employing a specifically designed biomechanical apparatus. Eight animals had their repair sites tested for bursting strength. RESULTS: Control (untreated) tendons showed fibrous tissue surrounding the repair sites with approximately 50% of the circumference of the repair site adherent to surrounding tissue elements. The mean histologic grades for control and study group were 3.1+/-0.2 and 1.9+/-0.2, respectively. The difference between mean grades for control and study group samples was statistically significant (paired t-test: P<0.01). The work of flexion (WOF) for flexion cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the control group was 0.58, 0.55, 0.46, and 0.44N/mm, respectively. The study (collagen-GAG wrapped) group had WOF values 0.16, 0.14, 0.10, 0.09N/mm, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (paired t-test, P<0.01). The mean bursting strength of repaired tendons for control and study groups were 14.3+/-1.87N and 11.5+/-1.85N, respectively. There was no significant difference in bursting strength between the groups (paired t-test, P=0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Collagen-GAG reduces formation of early postoperative tendon adhesions in this chicken flexor tendon repair model. Collagen-GAG wrapped tendons healed with minimal peritendinous adhesion formation and required less effort for flexion. The investing collagen-GAG membrane did not appear to interfere with either the quality or strength of healing."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tendon grafts play an important role in flexor tendon reconstruction. This study was an investigation of the effects of surface modification of allograft intrasynovial tendons with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin in an in vivo canine model. To mimic the actual clinical situation, a novel and clinically relevant model of a failed primary flexor tendon repair was used to evaluate the flexor tendon grafts. METHODS: Twenty-eight flexor digitorum profundus tendons from the second and fifth digits of fourteen dogs were lacerated and repaired in zone II in a first-surgery phase. The dogs were allowed free active motion postoperatively. In a second phase, six weeks later, the tendons were reconstructed with use of a flexor digitorum profundus allograft. In each dog, one graft was treated with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin (the CHG group) and the other was treated with saline solution, as a control. The dogs were restricted from free active motion, but daily therapy was performed beginning on postoperative day 5 and continued until six weeks after the operation, when the animals were killed. The outcomes were evaluated on the basis of digit work of flexion, gliding resistance, healing at the distal attachment, graft cell viability, histological findings, and findings on scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: In the first phase, all twenty-eight repaired tendons ruptured, with scar and adhesion formation in the repair site. Six weeks after allograft reconstruction, the mean work of flexion was 0.37 and 0.94 N-mm/degree in the CHG group and the saline-solution control group, respectively; these values were significantly different (p < 0.05). The gliding resistance in the CHG group was also significantly less than that in the saline-solution control group (0.18 versus 0.28 N) (p < 0.05), but no difference between groups was observed with regard to the distal tendon-bone pullout strength. Histological analysis showed that tenocytes in the host tendon proliferated and migrated toward the acellular allograft. CONCLUSIONS: This primary repair failure model was reproducible and reliable, with a uniform failure pattern, and provides an appropriate and clinically relevant animal model with which to study flexor tendon reconstruction. The surface modification of allografts with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin improved digital function and tendon gliding ability."

The flexor digitorum profundus tendon to the long and fourth toe of Leghorn chickens was lacerated and primarily repaired using a 2-strand technique. The repair site was then exposed to a single 5-minute application of 5-FU in concentrations of 5, 25, or 50 mg/mL. Legs were casted for 3 weeks. After death the tendon was examined for the work of flexion using a tensile testing machine and examined with light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy for morphologic and histologic differences in adhesion formation. Forty-seven chickens were examined. Average work of flexion values were 0.12 J for normal tendon, 0.31 J for operative controls, 0.34 J for the 5 mg/mL group, 0.15 J for the 25 mg/mL group, and 0.19 J for the 50 mg/mL group. The work of flexion was significantly reduced in the 25 and 50 mg/mL groups compared with the operative controls (p =.008 and p =.03, respectively). Histologic sections as graded by a blinded pathologist revealed decreased adhesion formation in all the 5-FU-treated animals (p <.008). Histologic examination showed that the highest concentration of 5-FU was not as effective at reducing adhesions as the 25 mg/mL dose. This appeared to be due to increasing inflammatory changes seen around and within the tendons of the 50 mg/mL group. Overall, a single intraoperative application of 5-FU at concentrations of 25 mg/mL appears to be an effective mechanism for reducing postoperative flexor tendon adhesions."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elongation (gap formation) at the repair site has been associated with the formation of adhesions and a poor functional outcome after repair of flexor tendons. Our objectives were to evaluate the prevalence of gap formation in a clinically relevant canine model and to assess the effect of gap size on the range of motion of the digits and the mechanical properties of the tendons. METHODS: We performed operative repairs after sharp transection of sixty-four flexor tendons in thirty-two adult dogs. Rehabilitation with passive motion was performed daily until the dogs were killed at ten, twenty-one, or forty-two days postoperatively. Eight tendons ruptured in vivo. In the fifty-six intact specimens, the change in the angles of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints and the linear excursion of the flexor tendon were measured as a 1.5-newton force was applied to the tendon. The gap at the repair site was then measured, and the isolated tendons were tested to failure in tension. RESULTS: Twenty-nine tendons had a gap of less than one millimeter, twelve had a gap of one to three millimeters, and fifteen had a gap of more than three millimeters. Neither the time after the repair nor the size of the gap was found to have a significant effect on motion parameters (p > 0.05); however, the ultimate force, repair-site rigidity, and repair-site strain at twenty newtons were significantly affected by these parameters (p < 0.05). Testing of the tendons with a gap of three millimeters or less revealed that, compared with the ten-day specimens, the forty-two-day specimens failed at a significantly (90 percent) higher force (p < 0.01) and had a significantly (320 percent) increased rigidity (p < 0.01) and a significantly (60 percent) decreased strain at twenty newtons (p < 0.05). In contrast, the tensile properties of the tendons that had a gap of more than three millimeters did not change significantly with time. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that, in a dog model involving sharp transection followed by repair, a gap at the repair site of more than three millimeters does not increase the prevalence of adhesions or impair the range of motion but does prevent the accrual of strength and stiffness that normally occurs with time."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Restoration of digital function after flexor tendon injuries remains a clinical challenge. Complications such as adhesion formation and tendon rupture can lead to limited hand function. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of the lactoferrin-derived peptide, PXL01, formulated in sodium hyaluronate (SH), with SH alone on joint mobility as an indirect measure of postsurgical adhesion prevention and healing strength of the tendon and to elucidate the most optimal concentration of PXL01. METHODS: Using a rabbit flexor tendon repair model, in which the deep flexor tendon was fully transected and repaired, PXL01 in SH or SH alone was administered between the repaired tendon and the tendon sheath before closure of the surgical wound. Three concentrations of PXL01 in SH (5, 20, or 40 mg/mL) were compared to determine the lowest effective concentration. The repaired tendons were evaluated 7 weeks after surgery by measuring the proximal interphalangeal joint mobility by full range of flexion assessment and the tendon repair strength. RESULTS: Treatment with PXL01 formulated in SH resulted in improved mobility of the proximal interphalangeal joint with an average of 10\u00b0, corresponding to improvement of approximately 25% to 60% of the flexion of nonoperated toes at the different measuring points compared with SH alone. The difference was statistically significant in 5 out of 6 measuring points (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 N; P < .05). The dose-response study indicated that the lowest effective concentration of PXL01 was 20 mg/mL. There was no difference in healing strength of the tendon between the groups as assessed by load-to-failure breaking strength. CONCLUSIONS: PXL01 in SH significantly improved the mobility compared with the carrier SH alone, without any negative effect on healing strength, and PXL01 at 20 mg/mL was the lowest effective concentration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The result provides a valuable basis for a clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of PXL01 in clinical hand surgery."

                "title": "Studies in flexor tendon wound healing: neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1 increases postoperative range of motion.",
                "abstract": "The postoperative outcome of hand flexor tendon repair remains limited by tendon adhesions that prevent normal range of motion. Recent studies using in situ hybridization techniques have implicated transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) in both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of repair. TGF-beta1 is a growth factor that plays multiple roles in wound healing and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of excessive scar formation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1 in a rabbit zone II flexor tendon wound-healing model. Twenty-two adult New Zealand White rabbits underwent complete transection of the middle digit flexor digitorum profundus tendon in zone II. The tendons were immediately repaired and received intraoperative infiltration of one of the following substances: (1) control phosphate-buffered saline; (2) 50 microg neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1; (3) 50 microg each of neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1 and to TGF-beta2. Eight rabbits that had not been operated on underwent analysis for determination of normal flexion range of motion at their proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, using a 1.2-N axial load applied to the flexor digitorum profundus tendon. All rabbits that had been operated on were placed in casts for 8 weeks to allow maximal tendon adhesion and were then killed to determine their flexion range of motion. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's unpaired t test. When a 1.2-N load was used on rabbit forepaws that had not been operated on, normal combined flexion range of motion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints was 93+/-6 degrees. Previous immobilization in casts did not reduce the range of motion in these forepaws (93+/-4 degrees). In the experimental groups, complete transection and repair of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon with infiltration of control phosphate-buffered saline solution resulted in significantly decreased range of motion between the proximal and distal phalanges [15+/-6 degrees (n = 8)]. However, in the tendon repairs infiltrated with neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1, flexion range of motion increased to 32+/-9 degrees (n = 7; p = 0.002). Interestingly, a combination of neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1 and that to TGF-beta2 did not improve postoperative range of motion [18+/-4 degrees (n = 7; p = 0.234)]. These data demonstrate that (1) the rabbit flexor tendon repair model is useful for quantifying tendon scar formation on the basis of degrees of flexion between proximal and distal phalanges; (2) intraoperative infiltration of neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1 improves flexor tendon excursion; and (3) simultaneous infiltration of neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta2 nullifies this effect. Because TGF-beta1 is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of excessive scar formation, the findings presented here suggest that intraoperative biochemical modulation of TGF-beta1 levels limits flexor tendon adhesion formation."

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to investigate a tissue engineering approach to improve functional outcomes after flexor tendon repair in a canine model. METHODS: Flexor digitorum profundus tendons were lacerated and repaired in 60 dogs that were followed for 10, 21, or 42 days. One randomly selected repair from either the second or fifth digit in one paw in each dog was treated with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and lubricin plus autologous bone marrow stromal cells stimulated with growth and differentiation factor 5; control repair tendons were not treated. Digits were analyzed by adhesion score, work of flexion, tendon-pulley friction, failure force, and histology. RESULTS: In the control group, 35 of 52 control tendons had adhesions, whereas 19 of 49 treated tendons had adhesions. The number of repaired tendons with adhesions in the control group was greater than the number in the treated group at all three times (p = 0.005). The normalized work of flexion in treated tendons was 0.28 (\u00b1 0.08), 0.29 (\u00b1 0.19), and 0.32 (\u00b1 0.22) N/mm/\u00b0 at Day 10, Day 21, and Day 42 respectively, compared with the untreated tendons of 0.46 (\u00b1 0.19) at Day 10 (effect size, 1.5; p = 0.01), 0.77 (\u00b1 0.49) at Day 21 (effect size, 1.4; p < 0.001), and 1.17 (\u00b1 0.82) N/mm/\u00b0 at Day 42 (effect size, 1.6; p < 0.001). The friction data were comparable to the work of flexion data at all times. The repaired tendon failure force in the untreated group at 42 days was 70.2 N (\u00b1 8.77), which was greater than the treated tendons 44.7 N (\u00b1 8.53) (effect size, 1.9; p < 0.001). Histologically, treated repairs had a smooth surface with intrinsic healing, whereas control repairs had surface adhesions and extrinsic healing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that tissue engineering coupled with restoration of tendon gliding can improve the quality of tendon healing in a large animal in vivo model. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Tissue engineering may enhance intrinsic tendon healing and thus improve the functional outcomes of flexor tendon repair."

                "abstract": "Two methods for measuring the ability of the flexor tendon to glide following repair are commonly cited in the literature; gliding resistance (GR) at the tendon-pulley interface and work of flexion. The GR measures the friction force at the tendon-pulley interface, while the work of flexion characterizes whole finger function during flexion. Since a portion of the total work of flexion (TWOF), termed the internal work of flexion (IWOF), is expended due to the tendon-pulley interaction, a relationship between the work of flexion and GR should be present. The purpose of this study was to quantify this correlation. Forty-eight flexor digitorum profundus tendons in 48 mongrel dogs were transected and repaired with a modified Kessler technique and an epitenon running suture. Post-operatively, the operated paw was immobilized in a cast. Dogs were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5 or 7 days after surgery. In each repaired digit work of flexion and GR were measured. While the GR was not significantly different over the time points, the TWOF decreased at 5 days after surgery and then increased at 7 days (p<0.05). There was little correlation between TWOF and GR (r=0.25, p=0.07). However, there was a strong correlation between IWOF and GR (r=0.76, p<0.05) suggesting that measurement of GR could be used as a predictor of IWOF within the short term after tendon repair."

However, the use of bovine thrombin has the risk of antibody formation. We evaluated the effects of the newer generation autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on flexor tendon healing. METHODS: We performed surgical repair of 32 flexor tendons from the index and ring digits of the hind paws of 8 New Zealand white rabbits. In the PRF group, the PRF membrane was either wrapped around or interposed between the repair sites. At 3 weeks after surgery, the tested tendons were subjected to range of motion analysis, cross-sectional area measurement, biomechanics testing, and histological analysis. RESULTS: The results showed no significant increase in range of motion in the PRF group compared with the control group, but there was a significant increase in cross-sectional area of the tendons in the PRF group. The biomechanical testing suggested that the control had a higher load to failure and stress to failure but similar stiffness and modulus to the PRF group. CONCLUSIONS: The PRF did not have a major influence on cellular organization. It also had an undesirable effect on the biomechanical properties of repaired flexor tendons. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest PRF may, in certain situations, hinder rather than enhance, the healing for repaired flexor tendons."

Tendons are the structures which enable the muscles to adhere to the bones and transmit the movement starting from the muscle to the bones. They have significant role in hand movement.

With the scientific studies conducted, flexor tendon morphology, kinematics, biomechanics, biological properties and tendon improvement became quite understandable, good suturing materials were developed and consequently successful studies regarding primary repair results were published. Flexor tendon surgery has reached its current level with the accumulation of knowledge obtained from the increased clinical and experimental studies. This study addresses flexor tendon injuries and surgical treatment methods. We achieved 76.12% full functioning fingers in the results; we obtained following the physical treatment application that started on the 10th day after primary repair that we performed in 67 patients who applied with acute flexor tendon Zone 1-2 and 3 incision. Flexion restriction and contracture developed in 16 patients (23.88%) at various levels.

The effect of digital motion on the early phases of tendon healing was investigated by comparing the rupture strengths of the two groups during the first 40 days after repair. The repairs in immobilized digits showed marked decreases in strength during the first 20 days, while the tendons in mobilized digits showed immediate and progressive gains in strength through the time intervals studied. By 5 days, the difference in strength between the two groups was significant (p less than 0.05), and the magnitude of this difference increased with time. The model developed in this study demonstrates that an initial loss of flexor tendon repair strength is not inevitable. Immediate constrained digital mobilization allows progressive tendon healing without an intervening phase of tendon softening."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Adhesion formation is the major complication after tendon repairs that halts functional restoration and causes disability in patients. This study aimed to compare the antiadhesion efficacy of two tendon protector sheets using a previously established turkey flexor tendon model. METHODS: Twenty-four adult Bourbon Red turkeys were randomized into three groups: (1) control, (2) type I collagen-glycosaminoglycan (Collagen-GAG), and (3) hyaluronic acid. In each group, the flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the middle digit was sharply lacerated at the proximal interphalangeal joint level. All operated feet were immobilized until sacrifice 6 weeks after the surgery. After sacrifice, the repaired and normal digits were collected for biomechanical testing, adhesion scores, histological examination, and adhesion-related gene expression analysis. RESULTS: At 42 days after tendon repair, the normalized work of flexion of the repaired digit was the lowest in the Collagen-GAG group. The Collagen-GAG group also had the lowest gross adhesion score, indicating minimal adhesion. The hyaluronic acid group showed lower adhesion scores compared with the control, but the difference was not statistically significant. Microscopically, the Collagen-GAG group had a significantly lower histological adhesion score than the control group. In the Collagen-GAG group, the gene expression levels of WNT3A, WNT5A, and WNT7A were suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: In an avian model of flexor tendon repair, the application of tendon protector sheets reduces peritendinous fibrotic tissue formation histologically. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There are currently limited commercially available products to reduce postoperative peritendinous adhesions. Further validation is needed to confirm the effectiveness of tendon protector sheets in improving surgical outcomes following tendon repairs."

RESULTS: Both antibulking techniques (groups 2 and 3) had significantly less work of flexion than group 1 (36.3 and 34.9 J vs 142.9 J, p < .001). There was no significant change in work of flexion between groups 2 and 3 (p > .05). There was no significant difference in terms of 2-mm gap formation among the 3 groups (p > .05). Groups 1 and 3 exhibited a significantly higher load to failure compared with group 2 (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The antibulking repair techniques used in this study decrease the work of flexion with no significant change in force to 2-mm gap formation. Group 2, however, did have significantly lower load to failure. These techniques might be beneficial in zone II flexor tendon injury, in which the tight annular pulley system restricts tendon gliding. However, this is a time 0 study and the potential adverse effects of increase tendon manipulation and trauma were not analyzed, which might increase adhesions and scar during the healing phase of tendon repair."

                "abstract": "The use of surgical lasers has been shown to decrease adhesion formation as compared with scalpel control groups in various surgical procedures. The potential benefits of laser technology have not been assessed in the treatment of adherent tendons. The current study was designed to first develop a reliable and reproducible model for consistent adhesion formation following flexor tendon trauma. The second goal was to compare the effects of laser tenolysis procedures on tendon gliding with those of traditional scalpel tenolysis. In phase I, the adhesion-induction model utilized bilateral standardized crush- abrasion injuries to the hind limb digital flexor tendons of New Zealand White rabbits. Following 4 weeks of immobilization, the animals were sacrificed, and peritendoneal adhesions were assessed biomechanically. A significantly higher maximal force was required to extract the adherent tendons from the foot as compared with nontraumatized control tendons. In phase II, six groups of animals underwent the same standardized tendon trauma. Four weeks later the rabbits were randomly assigned to undergo either CO2 laser or holmium:YAG laser tenolysis on one foot. Scalpel lysis was used on the contralateral foot and served as an intraindividual control. Biomechanical assessment was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks following tenolysis. Significantly less force was required to extract the treated tendons at 1 and 2 weeks following holmium:YAG laser tenolysis when compared with scalpel or CO2 laser tenolysis. After 4 weeks, differences between holmium:YAG and CO2 laser and scalpel treatment were no longer significant. Extracted tendons were pulled apart to failure, and no difference in breaking strength was noted between groups. We conclude that holmium:YAG laser tenolysis results in easier tendon gliding as compared with scalpel or CO2 laser tenolysis at early time points. Laser tenolysis does not affect intrinsic tendon strength."

                "abstract": "Postoperative rehabilitation is an important factor in determining functional outcome following intrasynovial flexor tendon repair. We hypothesized that a rehabilitation protocol that produced increased in vivo excursion would lead to increased digital range of motion and tendon strength and decreased adhesion formation in a canine model. Ninety-six flexor digitorum profundus tendons from 48 dogs were cut transversely and repaired by a multistrand suture technique. Postoperative rehabilitation was performed daily with a low excursion-low force (1.7-mm average excursion; < 10 N force) or a high excursion-low force (3.6 mm excursion; < 10 N force) protocol. After death of the dogs at 10, 21, or 42 days, specimens were evaluated for digital range of motion, tensile mechanical properties, elongation of the repair site, and adhesion formation. Our data indicate that the range of motion of digits whose tendons were at low or high excursion was similar to that of controls. Increased in vivo tendon excursion due to synergistic wrist motion did not significantly affect ex vivo flexion of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints or tendon displacement (p > 0.05). Similarly, tensile properties (ultimate load, repair site rigidity, and repair site strain at 20 N and at failure) and length of the gap at the repair site were not significantly affected by increased excursion (p > 0.05). Severity of adhesion formation was reduced slightly by increased excursion (p = 0.04). Our findings indicate that 1.7 mm of tendon excursion is sufficient to prevent adhesion formation following sharp transection of the canine flexor tendon and that additional excursion provides little added benefit."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: The outcome of flexor tendon surgery is negatively affected by the formation of adhesions which can occur during the healing of the tendon repair. In this experimental study, we sought to prevent adhesion formation by wrapping a collagen-elastin scaffold around the repaired tendon segment. METHODS: In 28 rabbit hind legs, the flexor tendons of the third and fourth digits were cut and then repaired using a two-strand suture technique on the fourth digit and a four-strand technique on the third digit. Rabbits were randomly assigned to study and control groups. In the control group, the operation ended by closing the tendon sheath and the skin. In the study group, a collagen-elastin scaffold was wrapped around the repaired tendon segment in both digits. After 3 and 8\u00a0weeks, the tendons were harvested and processed histologically. The range of motion of the digits and the gap formation between the repaired tendon ends were measured. The formation of adhesions, infiltration of leucocytes and extracellular inflammatory response were quantified. RESULTS: At the time of tendon harvesting, all joints of the operated toes showed free range of motion. Four-strand core sutures lead to significantly less diastasis between the repaired tendon ends than two-strand core suture repairs. The collagen-elastin scaffold leads to greater gapping after 3\u00a0weeks compared to the controls treated without the matrix. Within the tendons treated with the collagen-elastin matrix, a significant boost of cellular and extracellular inflammation could be stated after 3\u00a0weeks which was reflected by a higher level of CAE positive cells and more formation of myofibroblasts in the \u03b1SMA stain in the study group. The inflammatory response subsided gradually and significantly until the late stage of the study. Both the cellular and extracellular inflammatory response was emphasized with the amount of material used for the repair. CONCLUSION: The use of a collagen-elastin matrix cannot be advised for the prevention of adhesion formation in flexor tendon surgery, because it enhances both cellular and extracellular inflammation. Four-strand core sutures lead to less gapping than two-strand core sutures, but at the same time, the cellular and extracellular inflammatory response is more pronounced."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of the disrupted intrasynovial flexor tendon is troublesome and can be complicated by the rupture of weak repairs and the formation of adhesions. The central issue underlying the unsatisfactory outcomes is the lack of sufficient healing capacity, which prohibits aggressive postoperative tendon motion. Transfer of genes that are critical to healing by means of an efficient vector system offers a promising way of strengthening the repair. The purpose of the present study was to transfer the basic fibroblast growth factor gene through the adeno-associated viral-2 vector to injured digital flexor tendons and to investigate its effects on the healing strength of the tendon and on adhesion formation in a clinically relevant injury model. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight long toes from sixty-four white leghorn chickens were used. The flexor digitorum profundus tendons were cut completely in the digital sheath area and were repaired with the modified Kessler method. In Group 1, a total of 2 x 10(9) particles of adeno-associated viral vector harboring the basic fibroblast growth factor gene were injected into both ends of the cut tendon. In Group 2, the same amount of adeno-associated viral vector carrying the luciferase gene was injected. In Group 3 (the non-injection control group), the tendons were sutured without any injection. At the end of two, four, eight, and twelve weeks, the toes were harvested and the tendons were tested for determination of the load-to-failure strength. At the end of eight and twelve weeks, the energy required to flex the toes was tested. The morphology regarding healing status and adhesions around the tendon were evaluated at two, four, eight, and twelve weeks. RESULTS: The ultimate strength of repaired tendons that had been treated with adeno-associated viral vector-basic fibroblast growth factor was significantly greater than that of tendons that had been treated with the sham vector or simple repair both during the early healing period (two weeks, p < 0.01; four weeks, p < 0.01) and a later period (eight weeks, p < 0.05). At four weeks, the strength of tendons that had been treated with adeno-associated viral vector-basic fibroblast growth factor (8.9 +/- 1.9 N) was significantly greater than that of tendons that had been treated with sham vector (6.1 +/- 1.0 N) (p < 0.01) or simple suture (5.7 +/- 1.1 N) (p < 0.001). Statistically, the grading of adhesions was the same among all three groups at four and eight weeks, but at twelve weeks it was significantly less severe for tendons that had been treated with adeno-associated viral vector-basic fibroblast growth factor than for those that had been treated with simple suture (p < 0.05). The energy that was required to flex the toes after treatment with adeno-associated viral vector-basic fibroblast growth factor was not increased at eight or twelve weeks compared with that in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that basic fibroblast growth factor gene transfer to digital flexor tendons by means of adeno-associated viral vector-2 significantly increases healing strength during the critical tendon healing period but does not increase adhesion formation."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Release of part of the A2 pulley has been suggested to improve function after zone II primary flexor tendon repairs. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of A2 pulley release compared with pulley preservation on repaired tendon gliding resistance and rupture in the early postoperative period in a chicken model. METHODS: We divided 104 long toes from 52 Leghorn chickens into 2 experimental groups. In group 1, the flexor digitorum profundus tendons were cut completely and repaired surgically with either release or preservation of the A2 pulley. The tendon laceration was positioned so that the repair had to glide through the pulley with toe flexion. The toes were subjected to simulated active flexion at the end of the 2nd and 4th postsurgical weeks. The rupture rates of the tendons were recorded. In group 2, the volar two thirds of the tendons were cut and repaired, also in the region of the A2 pulley, with the pulley released or preserved. The force resisting tendon motion and the work of digital flexion with simulated active digital flexion were tested 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after surgery. RESULTS: At the end of the 2nd and 4th weeks, the tendon repairs showed significantly higher rates of rupture in the presence of an intact A2 pulley compared with those with the pulley released. Tendon gliding resistance was significantly increased with preservation of the pulley on postsurgical days 3, 5, 7, and 14; these toes required a greater number of motion cycles to reach steady levels of resistance and showed significantly higher steady resistance after digital motion. CONCLUSIONS: Release of the A2 pulley decreases the rate of repair rupture and the resistance to tendon gliding when the site of tendon repair has to glide through the pulley in the early postsurgical period. The findings of this study support partial release of the A2 pulley to favor successful tendon repair."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Critically ill patients often develop acute lung injury (ALI) in the context of different clinical conditions. We aimed to explore differences in early local and systemic features in three experimental animal models of ALI. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to high tidal volume (VT) ventilation (HVT) (n = 8, VT 24 ml/kg), massive brain injury (MBI) (n = 8, VT 8 ml/kg) or endotoxemia (LPS) (n = 8, VT 8 ml/kg). Each experimental group had its own control group of eight rats (VT 8 ml/kg). We measured arterial blood gases, mean arterial pressure, lung compliance, inflammatory mediators in plasma and their expression and gelatinase activity in the lungs after 3 h of injury. RESULTS: Despite maintaining relatively normal lung function without evidence of important structural changes, we observed altered lung and systemic inflammatory responses in all three experimental models. LPS triggered the most robust inflammatory response and HVT the lowest systemic proinflammatory response. The HVT group had higher Il6, Tnf and Cxcl2 mRNA in lungs than MBI animals. Metalloproteinase activity/expression and neutrophilic recruitment in the lungs were higher in HVT than in LPS or MBI. CONCLUSIONS: The early responses to direct or remote lung insult in our three models of ALI captured different physiological and biological features that could lead to respiratory and/or multiorgan failure."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Previous animal studies have shown that certain modes of mechanical ventilation (MV) can injure the lungs. Most of those studies were performed with models that differ from clinical causes of respiratory failure. We examined the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the setting of a clinically relevant, in vivo animal model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury ventilated with low or injurious tidal volume. METHODS: Septic male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and randomized to spontaneous breathing or four different strategies of MV for 3 h at low (6 ml/kg) or high (20 ml/kg) tidal volume (V(T)) with zero PEEP or PEEP above inflection point in the pressure-volume curve. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and perforation. Mortality rates, pathological evaluation, lung tissue cytokine gene expression, and plasma cytokine concentrations were analyzed in all experimental groups. RESULTS: Lung damage, cytokine synthesis and release, and mortality rates were significantly affected by the method of MV in the presence of sepsis. PEEP above the inflection point significantly attenuated lung damage and decreased mortality during 3 h of ventilation with low V(T) (25% vs. 0%) and increased lung damage and mortality in the high V(T) group (19% vs. 50%). PEEP attenuated lung cytokine gene expression and plasma concentrations during mechanical ventilation with low V(T). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a PEEP level above the inflection point in a sepsis-induced acute lung injury animal model modulates the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses associated with sepsis and decreases mortality during 3 h of MV."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: The mechanisms involved in lung injury progression during acute lung injury (ALI) are still poorly understood. Because WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling has been shown to be involved in epithelial cell injury and hyperplasia during inflammation and sepsis, we hypothesized that it would be modulated by mechanical ventilation (MV) in an experimental model of sepsis-induced ALI. METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled animal study performed using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and perforation. At 18 h, surviving animals were randomized to spontaneous breathing or two strategies of MV for 4 h: low tidal volume (V (T)) (6 ml/kg) plus 10 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) versus high (20 ml/kg) tidal volume (V (T)) with zero PEEP. Histological evaluation, measurements of WNT5A, total \u03b2-catenin, and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) protein levels by Western blot, and their immunohistochemical localization in the lungs were analyzed. RESULTS: Sepsis and high-V (T) MV caused lung inflammation and perivascular edema with cellular infiltrates and collagen deposition. Protein levels of WNT5A, \u03b2-catenin, and MMP7 in the lungs were increased in animals with sepsis-induced ALI. High-V (T) MV was associated with higher levels of WNT5A, \u03b2-catenin, and MMP7 protein levels (p < 0.001), compared to healthy control animals. By contrast, low-V (T) MV markedly reduced WNT5A, \u03b2-catenin, and MMP7 protein levels (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is modulated early during sepsis and ventilator-induced lung injury, suggesting that activation of this pathway could play an important role in both lung injury progression and repair."

DESIGN: Experimental study in an animal model of ventilator-induced lung injury. SETTING: Animal research laboratory. METHODS: Anesthetized male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with VT 9 ml/kg and PEEP 5 cmH2O, or VT 35 ml/kg and zero PEEP for 1 h, and were killed. Other rats received ventilation for 1 h with high VT, to observe survival (n=36), or to be monitored and killed at different points in time (24, 72 and 168 h; n=7 in each group). Blood samples for measuring biochemical parameters were obtained. Post-mortem, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, the aorta and pulmonary microvessels were isolated to examine ex-vivo vascular responses and pulmonary slices were examined (light microscopy). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mortality in rats ventilated with high VT was 19 of 36 (54%). Mechanical ventilation was associated with hypotension, hypoxaemia and membrane hyaline formation. AST, ALT, IL-6, MIP-2 serum and BAL fluid concentrations, as well as VEGF BAL fluid concentration, were increased in rats ventilated with high VT. Lung injury score was elevated. Aortic vascular responses to acetylcholine and norepinephrine, and microvascular responses to acetylcholine, were impaired. These changes resolved by 24-72 h. CONCLUSIONS: Injurious ventilation is associated with respiratory and vascular dysfunction, accompanied by pulmonary and systemic inflammation. The survival rate was about 50%. In survivors, most induced changes completely normalized by 24-72 h after the insult."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Mechanical power is a crucial concept in understanding ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). We adopted the null hypothesis that under the same mechanical power, resulting from combinations of different static and dynamic variables-some with high stress per cycle and others without-would inflict similar degrees of damage on lung epithelial and endothelial cells as well as on the extracellular matrix in experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To test this hypothesis, we varied tidal volume (Vt), which correlates with the stretching force per cycle, while adjusting respiratory rate (RR) to yield similar mechanical power values for identical durations across all experimental groups. DESIGN: Animal study. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS: Thirty male Wistar rats (333 \u00b1 26\u2009g). INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (positive end-expiratory pressure = 3\u2009cm H2O) with combination of Vt and RR sufficient to induce similar mechanical power (n = 8/group): Vt = 6\u2009mL/kg, RR = 140 breaths/minute (low Vt-high RR [LVT-HRR]); Vt = 12\u2009mL/kg, RR = 70 breaths/minute (high Vt-low RR [HVT-LRR]); and Vt = 18\u2009mL/kg, RR = 50 breaths/minute (very-high Vt-very-low RR [VHVT-VLRR]). All groups were ventilated for 80 minutes. A control group, not subjected to mechanical ventilation (MV), was used for molecular biology analyses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 80 minutes of MV, lung overdistension, alveolar/interstitial edema, fractional area of E-cadherin, and biomarkers of lung inflammation (interleukin-6), lung stretch (amphiregulin), damage to epithelial (surfactant protein B) and endothelial cells (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and angiopoietin-2), and extracellular matrix (versican and syndecan) were higher in group VHVT-VLRR than LVT-HRR. Plateau pressure and driving pressure increased progressively from LVT-HRR to HVT-LRR and VHVT-VLRR. CONCLUSIONS: In the current experimental model of ARDS, mechanical power alone is insufficient to account for VILI. Instead, the manner in which its components are applied determines the extent of injury at a given mechanical power value."

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, laboratory animal study. SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven male New Zealand white rabbits. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetized rabbits with hydrochloric acid-induced ALI were randomized (n = 9 per group) to 5.5 h NAVA (non-paralyzed), VC (paralyzed; Vt 6-ml/kg), or VC (paralyzed; Vt 15-ml/kg). PEEP was adjusted to hemodynamic goals in NAVA and VC6-ml/kg, and was 1 cmH2O in VC15-ml/kg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PaO2/FiO2; lung wet-to-dry ratio; lung histology; interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentrations in broncho-alveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid, plasma, and non-pulmonary organs; plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and tissue factor in BAL fluid and plasma; non-pulmonary organ apoptosis rate; creatinine clearance; echocardiography. PEEP was similar in NAVA and VC6-ml/kg. During NAVA, Vt was lower (3.1 +/- 0.9 ml/kg), whereas PaO2/ FiO2, respiratory rate, and PaCO2 were higher compared to VC6-ml/kg (p<0.05 for all). Variables assessing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), IL-8 levels, non-pulmonary organ apoptosis rate, and kidney as well as cardiac performance were similar in NAVA compared to VC6-ml/kg. VILI and non-pulmonary organ dysfunction was attenuated in both groups compared to VC15-ml/kg. CONCLUSIONS: In anesthetized rabbits with early experimental ALI, NAVA is as effective as VC6-ml/kg in preventing VILI, in attenuating excessive systemic and remote organ inflammation, and in preserving cardiac and kidney function."

HSP70 and cytokine mRNA levels were measured in total lung homogenates. RESULTS: PaO(2) levels and lung histology revealed no deterioration after PEEP ventilation and severe deterioration after ZEEP ventilation. There was a significant higher expression of HSP70 and IL-1beta mRNA in the lungs of the ZEEP group than in the PEEP group and nonventilated controls. In the ZEEP group high HSP70 levels were correlated inversely with low IL-1beta mRNA and low IL-6 mRNA.

METHODS: Paraquat-induced ALI rats were studied. At 24 h, animals were anaesthetised and further randomized as follows (n = 6/group): (1) pressure controlled ventilation mode (PCV) with tidal volume (V (T)) = 6 ml/kg and inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E) = 1:2; (2) three assisted ventilation modes: (a) assist-pressure controlled ventilation (APCV1:2) with I:E = 1:2, (b) APCV1:1 with I:E = 1:1; and (c) biphasic positive airway pressure and pressure support ventilation (BiVent + PSV), and (3) spontaneous breathing without PEEP in air. PCV, APCV1:1, and APCV1:2 were set with P (insp) = 10 cmH(2)O and PEEP = 5 cmH(2)O. BiVent + PSV was set with two levels of CPAP [inspiratory pressure (P (High) = 10 cmH(2)O) and positive end-expiratory pressure (P (Low) = 5 cmH(2)O)] and inspiratory/expiratory times: T (High) = 0.3 s and T (Low) = 0.3 s. PSV was set as follows: 2 cmH(2)O above P (High) and 7 cmH(2)O above P (Low). All rats were mechanically ventilated in air and PEEP = 5 cmH(2)O for 1 h. RESULTS: Assisted ventilation modes led to better functional improvement and less lung injury compared to PCV. APCV1:1 and BiVent + PSV presented similar oxygenation levels, which were higher than in APCV1:2. Bivent + PSV led to less alveolar epithelium injury and lower expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and type III procollagen. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental ALI model, assisted ventilation modes presented greater beneficial effects on respiratory function and a reduction in lung injury compared to PCV. Among assisted ventilation modes, Bi-Vent + PSV demonstrated better functional results with less lung damage and expression of inflammatory mediators."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To design, implement, and test a selective lung ventilator for setting a rat model of unilateral ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). DESIGN AND SETTING: Interventional animal study in a university laboratory for animal research. SUBJECTS: Anesthetized and paralyzed male Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: A selective ventilator designed to apply varying tidal volume, PEEP, and breathing gas to each lung of the rat was implemented and evaluated. Five control animals were ventilated at 7 ml/kg (3.5 ml/kg each lung). Unilateral VILI was induced in six animals subjected to selective ventilation (3.5 ml/kg in one lung and 15 ml/kg in the other lung). After 3 h of ventilation the animals were killed and the lungs excised. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Lung edema was assessed by means of the ratio between wet and dry lung weights. No significant differences were found in lungs of control animals (5.16+/-0.22 and 4.96+/-0.25), but the W/D ratio in the over ventilated lung (8.98+/-3.80) was significantly greater than that in the normally ventilated lung (4.76+/-0.15), indicating selective induction of lung edema by over stretch. CONCLUSIONS: This selective ventilator can be implemented into a rat model of unilateral VILI to gain further insight into the mechanisms of pulmonary injury induced by different ventilatory strategies."

DESIGN AND SETTING: Experimental study in an animal model of ventilator-induced lung injury in the animal research laboratory in a university hospital. METHODS: Young (3-4 months old) and old (22-24 months old) anesthetized Wistar rats were ventilated for 60 min with a protective lung strategy (VT=9 ml/kg and PEEP=5 cm H2O, control) or with an injurious strategy (VT=35 ml/kg and PEEP=0 cm H2O, over-ventilated; n=6 for each group). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure and airway pressures (PAW) were monitored. Arterial blood gases and serum AST, ALT, lactate, and IL-6 were measured. Vascular rings from the thoracic aorta were mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recording. We studied relaxations induced by acetylcholine (10 nM-10 microM) in norepinephrine-precontracted rings, and contractions induced by norepinephrine (1 nM-10 microM) in resting vessels. Lungs were examined by light microscopy. Injurious ventilation in young rats was associated with hypoxemia, lactic metabolic acidosis, increased serum AST, hypotension, impairment in norepinephrine and acetylcholine-induced vascular responses ex vivo and hyaline membrane formation. The high-VT induced hypotension, increase in mean PAW, AST, and IL-6, and the impairment in acetylcholine-induced responses were significantly more marked in aged than in young rats. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly rats showed increased susceptibility to injurious mechanical ventilation-induced pulmonary injury, vascular dysfunction, and systemic inflammation."

                "abstract": "Introduction: Endotoxemia is a common issue for patients with biliary obstruction. The lung is the most affected organ by endotoxins. Exercise training can alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and resveratrol has biological effects similar to exercise. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of exercise preconditioning, resveratrol, and their\u00a0combination on LPS-induced lung injury and mortality in rats with obstructive jaundice. Methods: Endotoxemia was simulated in rats by common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and intraperitoneal injection of low-dose LPS. The treatment groups were pretreated with exercise and/or resveratrol to assess their effects on lung injury and mortality. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and ELISA were subsequently used to evaluate the impact of exercise and/or resveratrol on inflammation in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Results: We found that even in the early stages, compared to sham-LPS rats, low-dose LPS induced excessive systemic inflammatory responses in CBDL rats, as evidenced by a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, severe lung inflammation, lung injury, and higher mortality rates, indicating that cholestasis increased rats' susceptibility to endotoxins. Exercise training reduced neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of model rats and IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Both exercise training and resveratrol exhibited synergistic effects in reducing macrophage accumulation in lung tissues, lowering TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in the lungs, and decreasing TNF-\u03b1 concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, exercise and combined interventions both significantly increased the expression of IL-10. The interventions induced a marked improvement in lung tissue pathological damage and lung edema in model rats and prolonged the survival time of rats with obstructive jaundice. Discussion: This study demonstrates that exercise preconditioning and/or resveratrol can significantly reduce rats' susceptibility to endotoxins after CBDL and alleviate lung injuries through their anti-inflammatory effects, thereby decreasing the mortality risk."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Alveolar macrophages are the sentinel cell for activation of the inflammatory cascade when the lung is exposed to noxious stimuli. We investigated the role of macrophages in mechanical lung injury by comparing the effect of high-volume mechanical ventilation with or without prior depletion of macrophages. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized sham-controlled animal study in anesthetized rats. METHODS: Lung injury was induced by 15 min of mechanical ventilation (intermittent positive pressure ventilation) using high peak pressures and zero end-expiratory pressure. The mean tidal volume was 40+/-0.7 ml/kg. One group of animals was killed immediately after this period of volutrauma (HV), while in a second group normoventilation was continued for 2 h at a tidal volume less than 10 ml/kg (HV-LV). One-half of the animals were depleted of alveolar macrophages by pretreatment with intratracheal liposomal clodronate (CL2MDP). MEASUREMENTS: Arterial blood gas, blood pressure. After kill: lung static pressure volume curves, bronchoalveolar fluid concentration for protein, macrophage inflammatory protein 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and wet/dry lung weight ratio (W/D). RESULTS: During HV and HV+LV oxygenation, lung compliance, and alveolar stability were better preserved in animals pretreated with CL2MDP. In both groups W/D ratio was significantly greater in ventilated than in nonventilated animals (4.5+/-0.6), but the increase in W/D was significantly less in CL2MDP treated HV and HV-LV groups (6.1+/-0.4, 6.6+/-0.6) than in the similarly ventilated nontreated groups (8.7+/-0.2 and 9.2+/-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Alveolar macrophages participate in the early phase of ventilator-induced lung injury."

                "abstract": "Although alveolar hyperoxia exacerbates lung injury, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate the beneficial effects of lowering the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Atelectasis, which is commonly observed in ARDS, not only leads to hypoxemia but also contributes to lung injury through hypoxia-induced alveolar tissue inflammation. Therefore, it is possible that excessively low FIO2 may enhance hypoxia-induced inflammation in atelectasis, and raising FIO2 to an appropriate level may be a reasonable strategy for its mitigation. In this study, we investigated the effects of different FIO2 levels on alveolar tissue hypoxia and injury in a mechanically ventilated rat model of experimental ARDS with atelectasis. Rats were intratracheally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish an ARDS model. They were allocated to the low, moderate, and high FIO2 groups with FIO2 of 30, 60, and 100%, respectively, a day after LPS injection. All groups were mechanically ventilated with an 8 mL/kg tidal volume and zero end-expiratory pressure to induce dorsal atelectatic regions. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed every 2\u00a0h. After six hours of mechanical ventilation, the rats were euthanized, and blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected and analyzed. Another set of animals was used for pimonidazole staining of the lung tissues to detect the hypoxic region. Lung mechanics, ratios of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to FIO2, and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide were not significantly different among the three groups, although PaO2 changed with FIO2. The dorsal lung tissues were positively stained with pimonidazole regardless of FIO2, and the HIF-1\u03b1 concentrations were not significantly different among the three groups, indicating that raising FIO2 could not rescue alveolar tissue hypoxia. Moreover, changes in FIO2 did not significantly affect lung injury or inflammation. In contrast, hypoxemia observed in the low FIO2 group caused injury to organs other than the lungs. Raising FIO2 levels did not attenuate tissue hypoxia, inflammation, or injury in the atelectatic lung region in experimental ARDS. Our results indicate that raising FIO2 levels to attenuate atelectasis-induced lung injury cannot be rationalized."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the effects of hyperventilation on acute lung injury (ALI) in spontaneously breathing rats. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomized to receive either intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or saline, and intravenous infusion of NH4Cl (to induce metabolic acidosis and hyperventilation) or saline. Four groups were established: control-control (C-C), control-hyperventilation (C-HV), LPS-control (LPS-C), and LPS-hyperventilation (LPS-HV). Venous blood gases were collected before and after NH4Cl infusion and analyzed to confirm the presence of metabolic acidosis and hyperventilation. After euthanasia, lung injury was assessed using the ALI score, morphometric quantification of perivascular edema, neutrophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage, and mRNA expression of biological markers in the lung tissue. RESULTS: Hyperventilation induced inflammatory lung injury in previously healthy lungs and exacerbated injuries previously induced by LPS (ALI score: C-C=0.14 [IQR 0.12; 0.14]; C-HV=0.36 [IQR 0.31; 0.37]; LPS-C=0.51 [IQR 0.50; 0.54]; LPS-HV=0.58 [IQR 0.56; 0.62]; p<0.01). Perivascular edema, neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage, and amphiregulin mRNA expression were higher in the LPS-HV group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperventilation increased inflammatory injury in rats with ALI during spontaneous ventilation. These results suggest that the impact of vigorous spontaneous breathing efforts on worsening inflammatory lung injury warrants further investigation."

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to investigate the protective effects of 18\u03b2-Glycyrrhetinic-acid (50 and 100\u202fmg/kg i.g) on LPS-induced rat sepsis model by analyzing some immune mechanisms including inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress parameters by different techniques such as Mallory's Trichome staining, ELISA, tissue biochemistry and Western Blotting. METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague Dawley rats divided into 6 groups as follows: (i) Control, (ii) DMSO, (iii) LPS induced-Sepsis, (iv) LPS induced-Sepsis+\u202f18\u03b2-GA 50\u202fmg/kg, (v) LPS induced-Sepsis +\u202f18\u03b2-GA 100\u202fmg/kg, (vi) 18\u03b2-GA 100\u202fmg/kg. The pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u00df, TNF- \u03b1) levels were measured by ELISA technique. All rat's lung tissues micrographed with Mallory's Trichome stain. Oxidative stress parameters (MDA, GSH, SOD, NRF2, and HO-1), TLR4 signaling, and apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Caspase-3) were detected by using tissue biochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS: LPS administration caused a significant increase in all pro-inflammatory cytokine and oxidant levels. Shedding of bronchiolar epithelium, thickening of alveolar septa and vascular dilatation in LPS groups' lung tissue were revealed according to the histopathological findings. The H-scores of 18\u03b2-GA50\u202f+LPS and 18\u03b2-GA100\u202f+LPS groups were significantly lower than LPS groups' (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). When lung tissue protein expression profiles were analyzed for HO-1, TLR4, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 expression was higher in the LPS group than in the control. In addition, NRF2 and Bcl-2 protein expressions were higher in control, DMSO and 18\u03b2-GA100 groups, while it was the lowest level in LPS group. CONCLUSION: 18\u03b2-GA demonstrates significant protective effects against LPS-induced lung injury in rats by modulating various immune mechanisms. These findings indicate that 18\u03b2-GA, particularly at the higher dose, may be a potential therapeutic agent in managing sepsis by mitigating inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in lung tissue. The inflammation and oxidative stress parameters were decreased and the apoptotic markers were increased in treatment group. Further molecular studies should be performed to investigate the roles of some significant cellular signaling pathways."

                "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by chronic airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation leading to progressive loss of lung function and eventual respiratory failure. Omadacycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, demonstrates in vitro activity against key CF pathogens, substantial lung penetration, and increasing clinical evidence for the treatment of lung infections in people with CF (PwCF). Preliminary in vitro data demonstrate that omadacycline exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. This study aims to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of omadacycline in vitro and in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung neutrophilia. In vitro, THP-1-derived macrophages were treated with omadacycline (20-100 \u00b5g/mL) 30 minutes prior to LPS stimulation. Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2/6), chemokine (CXCL-1/2), and MMP-9 levels were analyzed after 24 hours by ELISA. Omadacycline's effects on IL-8-induced human neutrophil chemotaxis were also investigated. In vivo, omadacycline (2.5-30 mg/kg), comparators dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), and azithromycin (30 mg/kg) were administered 1 hour before and 6 hours after intranasal LPS challenge, respectively. Leukocyte counts and differentials in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), inflammatory mediator levels in BALF and lung homogenates, pulmonary edema markers, and the severity of lung injury were evaluated 24 hours or 48 hours post-challenge. Treatment with omadacycline in vitro resulted in significant, dose-dependent reductions in IL-6, CXCL-1, and MMP-9 expression and inhibition of IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis. In vivo, omadacycline yielded protective and therapeutic effects by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and neutrophil infiltration into the lungs, along with modestly improving lung injury severity. These preclinical results suggest that omadacycline may provide dual anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities relevant to chronic lung infection treatment in PwCF.IMPORTANCENontuberculous mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC), are a major concern for people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) due to their association with deteriorating lung function. A substantial barrier to effective treatment is the limited number of safe and effective antibiotics. Omadacycline offers a potential advancement in managing MABSC infections in cystic fibrosis due to its activity, effective penetration into pulmonary secretions, improved tolerability, and good oral bioavailability as shown in healthy volunteers. Our study is the first to explore omadacycline's effects in a model of sterile lung inflammation and acute lung injury. We found that omadacycline not only has potent anti-bacterial properties but also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, reducing lung inflammation and injury in our preclinical models. These findings underscore omadacycline's potential as a dual-action therapy for lung infections in PwCF, indicating significant potential to improve patient outcomes and guide more effective antimicrobial therapy decisions."

                "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of non-muscle myosin \u2161 (NM\u2161) gene silenced bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) on pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibrosis in rats with acute lung injury (ALI) induced by endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: The experimental research methods were adopted. Cells from femur and tibial bone marrow cavity of four one-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were identified as BMMSCs by flow cytometry, and the third passage of BMMSCs were used in the following experiments. The cells were divided into NM\u2161 silenced group transfected with pHBLV-U6-ZsGreen-Puro plasmid containing small interference RNA sequence of NM\u2161 gene, vector group transfected with empty plasmid, and blank control group without any treatment, and the protein expression of NM\u2161 at 72 h after intervention was detected by Western blotting (n=3). The morphology of cells was observed by an inverted phase contrast microscope and cells labeled with chloromethylbenzoine (CM-Di\u2160) in vitro were observed by an inverted fluorescence microscope. Twenty 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into blank control group, ALI alone group, ALI+BMMSC group, and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group according to the random number table, with 5 rats in each group. Rats in blank control group were not treated, and rats in the other 3 groups were given LPS to induce ALI. Immediately after modeling, rats in ALI alone group were injected with 1 mL normal saline via tail vein, rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group were injected with 1\u00d7107/mL BMMSCs and NM\u2161 gene silenced BMMSCs of 1 mL labelled with CM-Di\u2160 via tail vein, and rats in blank control group were injected with 1 mL normal saline via tail vein at the same time point, respectively. At 24 h after intervention, the lung tissue was collected to observe intrapulmonary homing of the BMMSCs by an inverted fluorescence microscope. Lung tissue was collected at 24 h, in 1 week, and in 2 weeks after intervention to observe pulmonary inflammation by hematoxylin eosin staining and to observe pulmonary fibrosis by Masson staining, and the pulmonary fibrosis in 2 weeks after intervention was scored by modified Ashcroft score (n=5). The content of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 2 weeks after intervention (n=3), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase (MPO) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 24 h after intervention (n=3), and the protein expressions of CD11b and epidermal growth factor like module containing mucin like hormone receptor 1 (EMR1) in 1 week after intervention were detected by immunofluorescence staining (n=3). Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, Bonferroni method, and Kruskal-Wallis H test. Results: At 72 h after intervention, the NM\u2161protein expression of cells in NM\u2161 silenced group was significantly lower than those in blank control group and vector group (with P values <0.01). BMMSCs were in long spindle shape and grew in cluster shaped like vortexes, which were labelled with CM-Di\u2160 successfully in vitro. At 24 h after intervention, cell homing in lung of rats in ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was more pronounced than that in ALI+BMMSC group, while no CM-Di\u2160-labelled BMMSCs were observed in lung of rats in blank control group and ALI alone group. There was no obvious inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue of rats in blank control group at all time points, while inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue of rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly less than that in ALI alone group at 24 h after intervention, and alveolar wall turned to be thinner and a small amount of congestion in local lung tissue appeared in rats of the two groups in 1 week and 2 weeks after intervention. In 1 week and 2 weeks after intervention, collagen fiber deposition in lung tissue of rats in ALI alone group, ALI+BMMSC group, and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly aggravated compared with that in blank control group, while collagen fiber deposition in lung tissue of rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly improved compared with that in ALI alone group. In 2 weeks after intervention, modified Ashcroft scores for pulmonary fibrosis of rats in ALI alone group, ALI+BMMSC group, and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group were 2.36\u00b10.22, 1.62\u00b10.16, 1.06\u00b10.26, respectively, significantly higher than 0.30\u00b10.21 in blank control group (P<0.01). Modified Ashcroft scores for pulmonary fibrosis of rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group were significantly lower than that in ALI alone group (P<0.01), and modified Ashcroft score for pulmonary fibrosis of rats in ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly lower than that in ALI+BMMSC group (P<0.01). In 2 weeks after intervention, the content of \u03b1-SMA in lung tissue of rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group were significantly decreased compared with that in ALI alone group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The content of MMP-2 in lung tissue of rats in the 4 groups was similar (P>0.05). The content of MMP-9 in lung tissue of rats in ALI alone group was significantly increased compared with that in blank control group (P<0.01), and the content of MMP-9 in lung tissue of rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly decreased compared with that in ALI alone group (P<0.01). At 24 h after intervention, the activity of malondialdehyde, SOD, and MPO in lung tissue of rats in ALI alone group, ALI+BMMSC group, and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group were significantly increased compared with that in blank control group (P<0.01), the activity of malondialdehyde in lung tissue of rats in ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group and the activity of SOD in lung tissue of rats in ALI+BMMSC group and ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group were significantly increased compared with that in ALI alone group (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and the activity of SOD in lung tissue of rats in ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly decreased compared with that in ALI+BMMSC group (P<0.01).

In 1 week after intervention, the protein expression of CD11b in lung tissue of rats in ALI+NM\u2161 silenced BMMSC group was significantly increased compared with those in the other three groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while the protein expressions of EMR1 in lung tissue of rats in the four groups were similar (P>0.05). Conclusions: Transplantation of NM\u2161 gene silenced BMMSCs can significantly improve the activity of ECM components in the lung tissue in LPS-induced ALI rats, remodel its integrity, and enhance its antioxidant capacity, and alleviate lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis."

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) plays an initiating role in the onset of extracorporeal circulation (ECC)-induced ALI. METHODS: Eight New Zealand rabbits subjected to 1\u00a0h of ECC and 40\u00a0min of observation after termination of ECC were used for monitoring pulmonary nociceptor activity. Fifty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that received 2\u00a0h of ECC and 4\u00a0h of rest were used to measure the pulmonary function and inflammatory cytokines release, including total cells, neutrophils, and TNF-\u03b1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophils in blood. An additional 40 SD rats were randomized to pretreatment with inhalation of phosphate buffer solution (control group), IgG (IgG inh group), or TNF-\u03b1 antibody (anti-TNF-\u03b1 inh group) and venous injection of TNF-\u03b1 antibody (anti-TNF-\u03b1 iv group). After 2\u00a0h of ECC and 4\u00a0h of rest, the arterial blood and BAL fluid were collected for measurement of arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and inflammatory cytokines release. The left-lower-lung tissues of animals were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the activities of airway nociceptor and TNF-\u03b1 release were similarly upregulated at the early stage and in a time-related manner in ECC-induced ALI. Pretreatment with TNF-\u03b1 antibody inhalation, but not venous injection, improved pulmonary function, inhibited pulmonary inflammation, and attenuated pulmonary histopathological changes after ECC. CONCLUSION: We concluded that TNF-\u03b1 played an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI and acted as an initiating cytokine at the early stage of ECC-induced ALI."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We examined whether mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume induces polymorphonuclear infiltration and proinflammatory and profibrogenic responses in rat lungs compared dependent and nondependent lung region to expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and alpha-1 procollagen III (PC III) mRNA. DESIGN: An experimental, randomized and controlled protocol with previously normal rats. INTERVENTIONS: Three groups of ten animals were studied. Two groups were ventilated (FIO2=0.3) in supine position for 1 h without positive end expiratory pressure, one group with a low tidal volume (6 ml/kg), and the other with a high tidal volume (24 ml/kg). In the third group animals were kept in spontaneous ventilation for 1 h. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After ventilation the right lung was used to quantify polymorphonuclear infiltration. The left lung was divided into dependent and nondependent regions, and expression of IL-1beta and PC III mRNA was quantified by northern blot analysis. The group ventilated with low tidal volume had greater polymorphonuclear infiltration IL-1beta and PC III mRNA expression than the nonventilated group. Similar results were observed with high tidal volumes. There was no difference between low and high tidal volume ventilation. Expression levels of IL-1beta and PC III mRNA were higher in the nondependent region of ventilated groups and equal in the nonventilated group. CONCLUSIONS: Even a low tidal volume mode of mechanical ventilation induces proinflammatory and profibrogenic response, with a nondependent predominance for IL-1beta and PC III mRNA expression in supine, ventilated, previously normal rats."

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Our aim was to compare adaptive support ventilation with and without closed loop control by end tidal CO2 (ASVCO2, ASV) with pressure (PC) and volume control ventilation (VC) during simulated clinical scenarios [normal lungs (N), COPD, ARDS, brain injury (BI)]. METHODS: A lung model was used to simulate representative compliance (mL/cmH2O): resistance (cmH2O/L/s) combinations, 45:5 for N and BI, 60:7.7 for COPD, 15:7.7 and 35:7.7 for ARDS. Two levels of PEEP (cmH2O) were used for each scenario, 12/16 for ARDS, and 5/10 for others. The CO2 productions of 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL/kg predicted body weight/min were simulated. Tidal volume was set to 6 mL/kg during VC and PC. Outcomes of interest were end tidal CO2 (etCO2) and plateau pressure (P Plat). RESULTS: EtCO2 levels in N and BI and COPD were similar for all modes. In ARDS, etCO2 was higher in ASVCO2 than in other modes (p < 0.001). Under all mechanical conditions ASVCO2 revealed a narrower range of etCO2. P Plat was similar for all modes in all scenarios but ARDS where P Plat in ASV and ASVCO2 were lower than in VC (p = 0.001). When P Plat was \u2265 28 cmH2O, P plat in ASV and ASVCO2 were lower than in VC and PC (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: All modes performed similarly in most cases. Minor differences observed were in favor of the closed loop modes. Overall, ASVCO2 maintained tighter CO2 control. The ASVCO2 had the greatest impact during ARDS allowing etCO2 to increase and protecting against hypocapnia evident with other modes while ensuring lower P plat and tidal volumes."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To observe whether electroacupuncture (EA) can inhibit the inflammatory response via down-regulating hexokinase 2 (HK2) mediated Warburg effect in rats with acute lung injury (ALI). METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups, with 12 rats in each group. The ALI model was established by injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 5 mg/mL, 1 mL/kg) into the tail vein. The rats in the control group received intravenous injection of the same volume of 0.9% NaCl solution. Immediately after the modeling was completed, EA (3 Hz/15 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral \"Zusanli\" (ST36) and \"Chize\" (LU5) for 30 min, once a day for 5 consecutive days. The contents of serum interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) were measured by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) of the lung tissue was calculated to assess the severity of pulmonary edema. Histopathological changes of the lung tissue (inflammatory damage, damage score) were observed and calculated after hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) staining. The qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of HK2 mRNA and protein, respectively. The lactate kit was used to detect the lactate content of the lung tissue. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the serum IL-1\u03b2 content, lung damage score, ratio of W/D of the lung tissue, expression levels of HK2 mRNA and protein and the lactate content were significantly increased (P<0.01), while the serum TGF-\u03b2 content was significantly decreased (P<0.01) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the serum IL-1\u03b2 content, pathological score, HK2 mRNA expression level, and lactic acid content were significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the TGF-\u03b2 content was significantly increased (P<0.01) in the EA group. H.E. stain showed obvious congestion and hemorrhage of the lung tissue, disappearance of the alveolar structure with thickened alveolar wall, and a large number of inflammatory cells infiltration in the model group, which was relatively milder in the EA group, including milder pulmonary tissue congestion, partial alveolar fusion, and fewer inflammatory cells gathered in the alveolar septum, etc. CONCLUSIONS: EA can reduce the inflammatory response and pulmonary edema of ALI in rats, which may be related to its functions in down-regulating the content of serum IL-1\u03b2, and lung HK2 mRNA expression and lactic acid content and in up-regulating serum TGF-\u03b2 (anti-inflammatory factor) level and HK2-mediated Warburg effect."

            "abstract": "The present study presents a model for creation of neuroma-in-continuity in the rabbit, confirmed by histologic study, electrophysiology, and examination of molecular markers. Twelve New Zealand rabbits were used. The lateral fascicule of the peroneal nerve with 15-mm in length was resected. In the intervals from 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively, the histology showed the typical pathologic changes of neuroma by hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Luxol fast blue, and Van-Gieson staining. As compared with the healthy nerve, the motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and compound motor action potential (CMAP) were found significantly slowed and reduced. The expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in nerve and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mRNA in L7, S1 dorsal root ganglia were downgraded and upgraded, respectively, with formation of neuroma-in-continuity. These electrophysiologic and molecular markers' expression data can be used as reliable parameters for evaluation of management of the neuroma-in-continuity."

                "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging of peripheral nerves is increasingly used in the clinic for a wide range of applications. Although yet unapplied for experimental neuroscience, it also has potential value in this research area. This study explores the feasibility, possibilities and limitations of this technique in rabbits, with special focus on peripheral nerve regeneration after trauma. The peroneal nerve of 25 New Zealand White rabbits was imaged at varying time intervals after a crush lesion. The ultrasonic appearance of the nerve was determined, and recordings were validated with in vivo anatomy. Nerve swelling at the lesion site was estimated from ultrasound images and compared with anatomical parameters. The peroneal nerve could reliably be identified in all animals, and its course and anatomical variations agreed perfectly with anatomy. Nerve diameters from ultrasound were related to in vivo diameters (p < 0.001, R(2) = 77%), although the prediction interval was rather wide. Nerve thickenings could be visualized and preliminary results indicate that ultrasound can differentiate between neuroma formation and external nerve thickening. The value of the technique for experimental neuroscience is discussed. We conclude that ultrasound imaging of the rabbit peroneal nerve is feasible and that it is a promising tool for different research areas within the field of experimental neuroscience."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vasoactive drug alprostadil improves microcirculation and can be effective in treating disorders of peripheral nerves. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to have protective action in cerebral ischemia, disorders of spinal cord, and also peripheral nerves. However, the mechanism of action of VEGF in peripheral nerve injuries is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of application of alprostadil on the pathological and functional repair of crush nerve injuries and also the expression of VEGF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat sciatic nerves were crushed by pincers to establish the model of crush injury. All of the 400 sprague dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into: Control; saline; saline+VEGF-antibody; alprostadil; and alprostadil+VEGF antibody groups. The SPSS 11.5 software was used for statistical analysis. The expression of VEGF in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), following crush injury to sciatic nerves, was studied by reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electromicroscope, and electrophysiology. The effects of alprostadil on expression of VEGF, repair of neural pathology, and recovery of neural function were also evaluated. RESULTS: We found that VEGF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was significantly increased in alprostadil and alprostadil+VEGF-antibody groups, compared to the saline and saline+VEGF antibody groups. The number of VEGF-positive neurons was significantly increased in the alprostadil group, compared to the saline, saline+VEGF antibody, and alprostadil+VEGF antibody groups. Besides, addition of this drug also caused less pathological changes in DRGs, better improvement of nerve conduction velocities of sciatic nerves, and more increase of toe spaces of right hind limbs of rats. CONCLUSIONS: The vasoactive agent alprostadil may reduce the pathological lesion of peripheral nerves and improve the rehabilitation of the neural function, which may relate to upregulation of the expression of VEGF, following crush injury to the peripheral nerves."

                "abstract": "We developed electrophysiologic methods for testing the three major forelimb nerves as a tool to evaluate motor and sensory recovery in rats. Median, ulnar, or radial nerves were transected and repaired in Sprague-Dawley rats. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were recorded preoperatively and at various postoperative intervals. Correlation between grip strength and CMAPs was investigated. Reliable CMAPs were recorded for all three nerves. Median- or ulnar-nerve-derived SSEPs were reliably recorded; radial SSEPs could not be recorded. CMAPs followed typical regeneration patterns after nerve repair. SSEPs showed a consistent peak latency but fluctuating amplitude. Grip strength and median CMAP amplitude correlated positively. We conclude that it is possible to conduct minimally invasive electrophysiologic testing in rat forelimbs. The CMAP is a valid parameter that shows the typical time course of nerve regeneration and reinnervation."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although numerous animal models for low back pain associated with intervertebral disk (IVD) degeneration have been proposed, insufficient data have been provided to make any conclusions regarding pain. Our aim in this study was to determine the reliability of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection into the rat spine as an animal model representing human discogenic pain. METHODS: We studied IVD degenerative changes with pain development after a 10-microL CFA injection into the L5-6 IVD of adult rats using behavioral, histologic, and biochemical studies. Serial histologic changes were analyzed to detect degenerative changes. Expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), prostaglandin E (PGE), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were determined using immunohistochemistry or real-time polymerase chain reaction as support data for pain development. In addition, CGRP immunoreactivity (ir) at the IVD was considered indirect evidence of neural ingrowth into the IVD. RESULTS: There was a significant increase of the hindpaw withdrawal response in the CFA group until 7 wk postoperatively (P < 0.05). Histologic analyses revealed progressive degenerative changes of the disks without any damage in adjacent structures, including nerve roots. In the CGRP-ir staining study, the bilateral dorsal horns and IVD had positive ir after intradiscal CFA injection. CGRP mRNA expression was increased in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) at 2 and 4 wk, whereas PGE and iNOS mRNAs were markedly increased at 2 wk. The increment of CGRP expression was higher in allodynic rats compared with nonallodynic rats. CONCLUSION: Intradiscal CFA injection led to chronic disk degeneration with allodynia, which was suggested by pain behavior and expression of pain-related mediators. The increment of CGRP, PGE, and iNOS also suggest pain-related signal processing between the IVD and the neural pathway in this animal model. This animal model may be useful for future research related to the pathophysiology and development of novel treatment for spine-related pain."

                "abstract": "The treatment of neuroma-in-continuity is controversial. To bypass neuroma-in-continuity with a nerve graft using end-to-side neurorrhaphy is considered to be theoretically a good option. To test this therapeutic modality, we performed a nerve bypass graft in a neuroma-in-continuity rat model. An obstructive neuroma-in-continuity was created in a transected peroneal nerve by interposition using the aponeurosis of the spinal muscles. In the experimental animals, (1) immediate, (2) 3-week delayed, or (3) no ulnar nerve bypass graft was performed. The peroneal functional index (PFI), conduction velocity, tibialis anterior muscle weight, and histomorphometric analyses were performed and compared with control (simply cut and repair) animals. On postoperative day 70, the recoveries of the PFI values, conduction velocity, and tibialis anterior muscle weight in the bypassed animals showed no significant differences as compared with the control animals, and the extent of these recoveries in the bypassed animals were significantly superior to those in the no-graft animals. In the histomorphometric analysis, the mean percent nerve in the bypassed animals was significantly larger than that in the no-graft animals. In conclusion, this technique may be a good alternative to the current therapeutic techniques for neuroma-in-continuity when there is a significant retained function."

After nerve exposure, its adventitial layer was sutured with 8-0 nylon to the nerve bed, which had been cauterised to promote adhesion. Nerve kinematics, electrophysiology, blood flow and histology were assessed. Rabbits in which Fontana's bands were visible as normal through the epineurium, classified as a nonadhesion group (group I), lacked intraneural fibrosis. In this group, nerve conduction and nerve blood flow were well maintained. Rabbits in which Fontana's bands could not be seen were classified as the adhesion group (group II). This group was classified into two levels pathologically; thickening of epineurium and perineurium was observed but no endoneurial fibrosis (group IIa), and endoneurial fibrosis (Wallerian degeneration, myelin sheath thinning and fibrosis between nerve fibers) was noted (group IIb). Compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) were reduced in amplitude and blood flow was significantly decreased at adhesion sites in group IIb. In conclusion, adhesion of peripheral nerve to surrounding tissues results in fibrosis in the nerve that contributes to peripheral nerve dysfunction."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of peripheral nerve injuries focuses on lesion type, from expectant to interfascicular repair. Many experiments have been undertaken using different factors to facilitate better or faster nerve stump growth: nerve growth factor (NGF), plaque growth factor (PGF), hyaluronic acid, leukemic inhibiting factor, and GABA, etc. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain stem and spinal cord, and it also plays a critical role as a modulator of NMDA receptors. We studied the potential regenerative effect of glycine administered for different periods of time and compared results with a control group. METHODS: The sciatic nerve of Wistar rats was exposed and the electrophysiology procedure was performed: the nerve was cut transversally and stitched back in place with four isolated cardinal 9/0 nylon stitches on each end. Study group rats were administered glycine 40 mM/kg daily for 15, 30, and 60 days, while control group rats were medicated with isotonic saline solution 0.9% for the same time periods. At the end of each study time period, the electrophysiological study was repeated. Animals were sacrificed on the 15th, 30th and 60th postoperative day and the sciatic nerve was exposed and prepared for histological studies. RESULTS: According to our results, glycine was effective in the morphologic regeneration and functional recovery of the sciatic nerve post-injury in Wistar rats with one month administration. CONCLUSION: We observed that nerve histology with glycine administration was more similar to that of normal nerves."

                "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To construct a chronic intraorbital optic nerve compression damage model in rabbits and investigate pathologic changes of the retina and optic nerve. METHODS: A balloon was implanted into the orbit of rabbits, in which contrast medium was filled at designated time points to simulate chronic tumor compression on the intraorbital optic nerve. Funduscopy, visual electrophysiology, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, apoptosis and gene assays were used to examine the changes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neuroglial cells, as well as the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) in each phase of the chronic intraorbital optic nerve damage (2, 4 and 8 weeks after modeling). RESULTS: Funduscopic examination showed that there was no significant change in the optic disk in non-compression group; the optic disk was congested and edematous in 2 w-compression group, but with no significant change in color; in 4 w-compression group, edema was lessened but color became lighter; in 8 w-compression group, no edema was found but the color was pale. Flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) suggested that the change of FVEP wave forms was more obvious as the compression extended, especially the low, flat, wide and irregular wave forms; the latent period of P(1), N(1) and P(2) was prolonged and the amplitude became lower. Compared with the wave form in non-compression group, there was no significant difference in 2 w-compression group (P>0.05), but the differences were prominent in 4 w- and 8 w-compression groups (P<0.01). Histopathology checks indicated no changes in the retina and optic nerve in non-compression group; in 2 w-compression group, there were also no significant changes, but the cell number of optic nerve decreased, the fibers were deranged, and the bundle membrane was damaged; in 4 w-compression group, nuclei in the RGC layer became sparse, the cell number of optic nerve increased significantly, the optic nerve bundles were deranged; in 8 w-compression group, nuclei in the RGC layer remained sparse and disordered, in the optic nerve there were a large number of disordered and deranged cells, the structure of fiber bundles was not clear, the bundle membrane was incomplete. Immunohistochemistry results showed there was no obvious change in the content of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the optic nerve in non-compression group; its expression began increasing in 2 w-compression group and remained high level in 8 w-compression group. With the compression extending, the number of apoptotic cells in RGCs layer increased gradually, and it was positive correlation with the compression time. CNTF and GAP-43 expressions were low in blank control and non-compression groups, and were up-regulated in 2 w-compression group (P<0.01); with the compression extending, the expressions of two genes increased gradually (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: A chronic intraorbital optic nerve compression damage model was constructed successfully, and in that way we found that with the compression extending, more RGCs were lost; the structure of optic nerve fibers was damaged; the number of neuroglial cells tended to decreased at the beginning and then increased; and the CNTF and GAP-43 expressions increased gradually 2 weeks after damage."

The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of abnormal nerve conduction findings and the electrophysiological characteristics of PN in DM1. We analyzed medical records, data from nerve conduction studies (NCS), and the results of genetic analysis of 18 patients with DM1 and 30 healthy individuals. The early changes identified in NCS were determined using the sural/ulnar sensory nerve action potential amplitude ratio (SUAR). To correlate the neuropathic changes with cardiac abnormality, we compared the corrected Q-wave/T-wave interval (QTc) with the NCS parameters. Eight of 18 patients had abnormal NCS findings. Of these, abnormal peroneal motor nerve conduction and H-reflex abnormalities were most common. Only one patient complained of sensory symptoms and had abnormal sensory and motor nerve conduction compatible with sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. There were no significant correlations between SUAR and disease duration, age, gene CTG repeats, or the QTc. The presence of diabetes was not related to abnormal nerve conduction or SUAR. The frequency of PN or abnormal NCS results was lower in our patients with DM1 than in previous studies. Our findings suggest that most abnormal NCS results in DM1 patients are more likely to result from myopathic changes, coincidental neuropathies, or radiculopathies than from primary involvement of the nerve."

                "abstract": "Although use of platelet gel (PG) for promoting tissue regeneration is a popular approach because of its capacity to accelerate tissue regeneration, to our knowledge, its effects on peripheral nerve have still not been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate effects of PG on sciatic nerve regeneration using electrophysiology, stereology, and electron microscopy. The study was performed using five groups of rats: sham operated (Sham), collagen tube conduit (CT), collagen tube conduit plus platelet gel (CT + PG), autogenous nerve graft (ANG), and primary repair (PR) groups. Gap length for CT and CT + PG groups is 1 cm. Electrophysiology showed that nerve conduction velocity was not different among experimental groups; the amplitude of compound action potential of PR group was significantly higher than other groups. Examination of the nerves showed that Sham group not only had a larger axon diameter but also a thicker myelin sheath. A higher number of myelinated axon was found in both ANG and PR groups in comparison to Sham, CT, and CT+PG groups. There is no significant difference between morphological quantities of CT+PG and CT group. It was expected that regeneration degree of the nerve fibers of CT+PG group would be better than CT group, which was the control group permitting to disclose the presence of a positive effect of PG on nerve regeneration, but this was not the case. Therefore, our results suggest that PG does not improve axon regeneration after microsurgical reconstruction of a nerve gap by collagen tubes."

                "abstract": "After restitution of motor function the grasping test alone is insufficient to figure out any further differences of axonal nerve regeneration of the median nerve in rats. To avoid this problem we developed a standardized electrophysiologic method for testing median nerve regeneration. Threshold, latency, compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and velocity of neuromuscular transduction were recorded in 54 rats 20 weeks post-operatively. Animals of group 1 served as control group, no transection of the median nerve was carried out. Animals of groups 2 and 3 underwent either primary nerve coaptation or autologous nerve grafting after transection of the median nerve. To ensure validity of the method additional correlation between all parameters was investigated. Reliable electrophysiological results were observed in all animals. As expected, group 1 animals showed lowest threshold and latency and highest CMAP levels. Transection of the median nerve and additional nerve repair leads to significant increase of threshold and latency as well as reduction of CMAP. Furthermore, animals of group 3 showed higher levels for threshold and latency and reduced CMAP levels compared with animals of group 2. The grasping test alone could not demonstrate these slight differences 20 weeks post-operatively. Additionally, we observed strong correlations between threshold, latency and CMAP using the Spearman correlation ranking. We describe the usage of motor neurography as a reproducible and valid tool which should be mandatory for detailed analysis of regeneration in the rat median nerve model."

                "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistological and behavioral analysis of the effect of a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor in an injured-nerve model. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of direct application of a TNF-alpha inhibitor (etanercept) on injured-nerve pain caused by nucleus pulposus. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: TNF-alpha is thought to play a crucial role in radicular pain. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is an inflammatory neuropeptide found in small sensory neurons. We have reported that CGRP appears in medium and large dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that transmit proprioception in physiologic conditions. The purpose of the current study was to examine the change in behavior and phenotypic change of CGRP-immunoreactive DRG neurons by the TNF-alpha inhibitor, etanercept, in a disc herniation model. METHODS: For the injured-nerve model, nucleus pulposus was applied to the sciatic nerve and the sciatic nerve pinched. Saline (10 microL; n = 10), as a control, or etanercept (150 microg: n = 10) were applied to sciatic nerves simultaneously. Mechanical allodynia was examined. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine CGRP expression in L5 DRGs. RESULTS: Significant mechanical allodynia for 10 days was seen in the injured-nerve group compared with sham-operated animals. Etanercept ameliorated the mechanical allodynia slightly on day 2; however, there was no effect on other days. CGRP immunoreactivity was upregulated in the L5 DRG neurons of injured-nerve groups compared with the sham-operated group (P < 0.01). However, etanercept did not affect CGRP expression after nerve injury (P > 0.05). Proportions of CGRP- immunoreactive medium and large neurons were not significantly different in the nerve injury + saline group compared with the injury + etanercept group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that direct application of a TNF-alpha inhibitor had a small effect on acute pain behavior and may not be effective for suppression of inflammatory peptides in the current disc-herniation model."

                "abstract": "Although surgery techniques improved over the years, the clinical results of peripheral nerve repair remain unsatisfactory. In the present study, we compare the results of a collagen nerve guide conduit to the standard clinical procedure of nerve autografting to promote repair of transected peripheral nerves. We assessed behavioral and functional sensori-motor recovery in a rat model of peroneal nerve transection. A 1cm segment of the peroneal nerve innervating the Tibialis anterior muscle was removed and immediately replaced by a new biodegradable nerve guide fabricated from highly purified type I+III collagens derived from porcine skin. Four groups of animals were included: control animals (C, n=12), transected animals grafted with either an autologous nerve graft (Gold Standard; GS, n=12) or a collagen tube filled with an acellular skeletal muscle matrix (Tube-Muscle; TM, n=12) or an empty collagen tube (Collagen-Tube; CT, n=12). We observed that 1) the locomotor recovery pattern, analyzed with kinetic parameters and peroneal functional index, was superior in the GS and CT groups; 2) a muscle contraction was obtained in all groups after stimulation of the proximal nerve but the mechanical muscle properties (twitch and tetanus threshold) parameters indicated a fast to slow fiber transition in all operated groups; 3) the muscular atrophy was greater in animals from TM group; 4) the metabosensitive afferent responses to electrically induced fatigue and to two chemical agents (KCl and lactic acid) was altered in GS, CT and TM groups; 5) the empty collagen tube supported motor axonal regeneration. Altogether, these data indicate that motor axonal regeneration and locomotor recovery can be obtained with the insertion of the collagen tube RevolNerv. Future studies may include engineered conduits that mimic as closely as possible the internal organization of uninjured nerve."

                "title": "[Evaluation of polyneuropathy severity in chronic renal failure patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or on maintenance hemodialysis].",
                "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to assess severity of injury of the peripheral nervous system of chronic renal failure patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) diagnosed based on the electrophysiological testing as well as to establish the effect of adequate dialysis dose on peripheral nerve functioning. The study was performed in 53 patients (21 males, 32 females) on CAPD for mean 16.9 +/- 14.4 months and 68 patients (46 males, 22 females) on HD for mean 47.5 +/- 46.5 months. Both groups were age matched (48.9 +/- 12.4 vs. 50.6 +/- 11.9 yrs; p= NS). Patients with co-existing diseases that could lead to disturbances in nerve conduction were excluded from the study group. METHODS: Electrophysiological testing was performed using Medelec Shaphire 2ME equipment. Nerve conductivity testing was performed in motor and sensory fibres of right ulnar nerve, motor fibres of right fibular nerve and left tibial nerve as well as in sensory fibres of right calf nerve. In the sensory nerves there were assessed: amplitude of the evoked sensory response, latency of the response and conduction velocity. In the motor nerves there were analyzed amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, latency of the evoked response, F-wave minimal latency and conduction velocity. Polyneuropathy was diagnosed if abnormal results obtained in electrophysiological examination were found in at least two out of four tested nerves. To assess dialysis adequacy in the CAPD group weekly Kt/V (wKt/ V) and weekly creatinine clearance (WCrCI) were used and in the HD patients the following indices were measured: Kt/V, PRU, TAC and TAD. RESULTS: Polyneuropathy diagnosed based on the above described criteria, was found in 59 (86.8%) HD patients and in 41 (77.4%) CAPD patients (p= NS). The results of motor conductivity testing showed significantly longer distal latency in HD patients in comparison to the CAPD patients in fibular nerve (4.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.8 ms; p< 0.05) and F-wave latency in ulnar nerve (29.3 +/- 3.1 vs. 27.3 +/- 2.5 ms; p< 0.05), in fibular nerve (52.4 +/- 6.4 vs. 48.5 +/- 7.94 ms; p< 0.05), in tibial nerve (54.8 +/- 7.8 vs. 50.6 +/- 7.12 ms; p< 0.05) and also significantly lower conduction velocity in ulnar nerve (51.9 +/- 5.9 vs. 55.6 +/- 6.99 m/s; p< 0.05), in fibular nerve (41.2 +/- 5.9 vs. 44.5 +/- 5.5 m/s; p< 0.05), in tibial nerve (40.1 +/- 5.81 vs. 42.7 +/- 4.6 m/s; p< 0.05). Mean value of sensory response amplitude evoked in ulnar nerve was significantly higher in the CAPD treated patients than in HD patients (21.2 +/- 14.8 vs. 15.1 +/- 11.4 microV; p< 0.05) and distal latency in calf nerve was significantly shorter (2.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.6 ms; p< 0.05). Analysing the effect of dialysis on peripheral nerve functioning in the group of CAPD patients a statistically significant relationship between the severity of peripheral nerve injury and WCrCl was demonstrated. Mean value of WCrCl in patients without features of neuropathy was significantly higher (83.3 +/- 28.98 l/week/ 1.73m2) in comparison with those with diagnosed polyneuropathy (59.9 +/- 15.9 l/week/1.73m2) (p< 0.01). Analyzing effect of WCrCl on conduction velocity in the tested nerves there was demonstrated that in patients with WCrCl value at least 60 l/week/1.73m2, mean velocity values were higher, and the statistically significant difference was found for sensory (p< 0.05) and motor (p< 0.01) fibers of ulnar nerve. Mean value of residual renal clearance in the CAPD treated patients without features of sensory and motor nerve injury was significantly higher (2.9 +/- 1.8 ml/min) when compared to the patients with diagnosed polyneuropathy (1.4 +/- 1.3 ml/min) (p= 0.006). In the hemodialyzed group no statistically significant relationship was found between conduction velocity in the tested nerves and indices of dialysis efficiency (Kt/V, PRU) as well as degree of exposure to uremic toxemia described by TAC and TAD. CONCLUSIONS: Polyneuropathy is a common complication in patients with chronic renal failure independently of a kind of the therapy. Well preserved residual renal function in CAPD patients plays an important role in improving effectiveness of the dialytic treatment, in consequence influencing preservation of proper peripheral nerve function."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The surgical approach used today in the repair of peripheral nerve injuries rarely achieves full functional recovery. This study determines whether isolation of the nerve repair site using photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) in combination with human amniotic membrane can improve both functional and histologic recovery. METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits (n = 24) underwent transection of the right common peroneal nerve. Epineural nerve repair was performed using 10-0 nylon sutures. The repair site was then wrapped in a cuff of human amniotic membrane, which either was secured with sutures or sealed using PTB. Standard neurorrhaphy alone was assessed as a control group. Functional recovery was recorded at 30-day intervals postoperatively by electrophysiologic assessment. At 120 days, animals were killed humanely and nerves harvested for histomorphometry. RESULTS: Nerves treated with amnion wraps and sealed with PTB demonstrated a statistically significant improvement across both functional and histologic parameters. Functional recovery, as measured by repeated electrophysiologic studies over time, revealed a 26.2% improvement over standard neurorrhaphy alone (P < .05). Nerves treated with PTB-sealed amnion wraps had significantly greater (P < .001) axon (5.08 +/- 1.06 microm) and fiber diameters (7.46 +/- 1.37 microm), as well as myelin thickness (2.39 +/- 0.7 microm) and the g ratio (axon diameter/fiber diameter ratio; 0.68 +/- 0.07) distal to the repair site compared to standard neurorrhaphy alone (4.98 +/- 1.81 microm, 6.77 +/- 1.94 microm, 1.79 +/- 0.42 microm, and 0.71 +/- 0.09, respectively). CONCLUSION: Isolation of the repair site using a photochemically sealed amnion wrap improves electrophysiologic and histologic recovery compared to standard suture neurorrhaphy."

                "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of the transplantation of a tissue-engineered nerve derived from an acellular allogenic nerve graft, combined with autologous bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs), into peripheral nerve defects. In a rhesus monkey model, nerve regeneration was evaluated across a 1-cm lesion in the radial nerve by using an acellular allogenic nerve injected with autologous MSCs. Simple acellular nerve allografts served as control. Eight weeks after surgery, immunofluorescence staining, histologic morphometrical analysis and electrophysiologic evaluation were performed. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that some MSCs were immunopositive to S-100 protein, indicating a Schwann cell (SC) phenotype. The group treated with cultured MSCs showed a statistically higher number of nerve fibers, with well-shaped remyelinated axons. The motor conduction velocities and the peak amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) for the group treated with MSCs were higher than those of the controls. This outcome indicated that MSCs are able to differentiate into Schwann-like cells in vivo and to promote nerve regeneration in primates. Furthermore, the acellular nerves injected with MSCs provided a favorable environment for the growth and myelination of regenerating axons when compared to acellular nerves alone."

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether thalidomide induces a sensory ganglionopathy or a length-dependent axonal neuropathy is disputed. Moreover no agreement exists concerning the effects of thalidomide dosage on the clinical and electrophysiological findings. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of age, gender disease duration, total cumulative dose on the clinical and electrophysiologic parameters. METHODS: Fifteen patients who had previously received 100 mg/day of thalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma were evaluated retrospectively. Clinical findings and nerve conductions studies were evaluated using a modified total neuropathy scoring system. RESULTS: Sensory symptoms (p = 0.033, r = 0.552) and objective sensory findings (p = 0.002, r = 0.730) worsened with higher thalidomide doses. There was no effect of age, gender and disease duration, neither on clinical symptoms and objective findings, nor on electrophysiologic data. Twelve patients (80%) developed the electrophysiological findings of neuropathy. Six (40%) had pure sensory and 4 (26.6%) had sensori-motor peripheral neuropathy, while 4 (26.6%) had carpal tunnel syndrome. Sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes were more prominently reduced compared to SNAPs obtained from the upper extremities. Sural SNAP amplitude showed a tendency toward reduction as the total cumulative dose, although it is not statistically significant (respectively; p = 0.187). Significantly reduced ulnar peroneal and tibial compound muscle action potential amplitudes, slow motor nerve conduction velocities of the ulnar and peroneal nerves were found in the study group compared to reference norms (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that thalidomide produces a dose dependent peripheral neuropathy, mainly localized to the peripheral nerves in a length dependent manner. The patient must be monitored closely to prevent irreversible consequences."

                "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of bypass nerve grafting with end-to-side neurorrhaphy in repair of the partial nerve injury in a rabbit model. Thirty-six adult male New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. A partial nerve injury was created by removal of a segment of the lateral fascicle of the left peroneal nerve. In group one, the injured nerve was repaired with nerve graft bypassing the injury site in an end-to-side fashion 4 weeks after injury. In group two, the injured nerve was repaired with end-to-end interpositional nerve grafting 6 weeks after injury. The injured nerve without repair was used as the control. Sixteen weeks after nerve repair, in groups one and two, and 20 weeks after the initial nerve injury in the control group, the nerves were dissected for electrophysiological examination and biopsied for histology and molecular markers expression. The nerve repair with interpositional nerve grafting achieved maximal functional recovery. However, motor nerve conduction velocity and compound motor action potential in nerve repair with bypass nerve grafting were significantly higher than that in the nerve injury without repair. Histologically, the regenerated myelinated axons and unmyelinated axons were present in the distal peroneal nerves in the bypass nerve grafts. The axon counts in nerve repair with the bypass nerve grafting were also significantly higher than that in the nerve injury without repair. The comparisons of the ciliary neurotrophic factor and the calcitonin gene-related peptide gene expressions between nerves with and without repair were significantly different. End-to-side bypass nerve grafting can significantly improve functional recovery in the nerve with partial injury and may be a useful repair strategy in neuromas-in-continuity."
